In order to address gaps in the literature surrounding the acquisition of
translation equivalents (TEs) in young bilinguals, two experiments were
conducted. In Experiment , TEs were measured in the expressive
vocabularies of thirty-four French–English bilinguals at ;, ;, and

occurred gradually, with more balanced ratios of exposure and
vocabulary associated with larger proportions of TEs at each wave.
Experiment  compared a direct measure of TE comprehension with
parent report of the same set of words. Results showed that parents
may over-report children’s TE comprehension, as our sample of two-
year-old French–English bilinguals (n = ) comprehended fewer TEs
on a direct measure of receptive vocabulary than parents reported on
the vocabulary checklist. The present study provides an original
contribution to the literature on bilingual vocabulary development by
employing both a longitudinal design and a direct measure of TE
comprehension.

milestones, such as babbling and producing ﬁrst words, at the same rate as
monolingual infants, despite the fact that the input that bilingual infants
hear is much more complex (Nicoladis & Genesee, ; Oller, Eilers,
Urbano & Cobo-Lewis, ; Pearson, Fernández, Lewedeg & Oller,
). Bilingual infants are often exposed to two languages from birth,
and they must use the speciﬁc properties of this dual input to diﬀerentiate
one language from the other. Despite these unique challenges, bilingual
infants form lexical representations for words in each of their languages
early on as they quickly begin to incorporate translation equivalents (TEs)
into their vocabularies. TEs, or doublets,

representations that a speaker has in each language for the same concept
(e.g., dog in English and chien in French). Importantly, by the end of the
second year, bilingual children’s vocabularies are composed of an average
of approximately % TEs (Bosch & Ramon-Casas, ; David & Wei,
; Pearson, Fernández & Oller, ; Poulin-Dubois, Bialystok, Blaye,
Polonia & Yott, ), although there is typically a great deal of variability
between children. This feat is quite impressive as it suggests that bilingual
children are able to understand early on in development that two words
can mean the same thing. However, although the acquisition of TEs
during infancy is an important part of bilingual vocabulary development,
there are still many gaps in the literature on this topic, as most research
has centered on case studies, or studies conducted with very small sample
sizes. More importantly, most studies on TE acquisition exclusively utilize
parent
report measures of vocabulary, and very few studies have
investigated the development of TEs over time, using longitudinal designs.
As a result, our knowledge of the rate of TE development during infancy
is quite limited. In order to address these gaps in the literature, two

experiments were conducted. The aim of the ﬁrst experiment was to examine
changes in the proportion of TEs on the MacArthur Bates Communicative
Development Inventory (CDI) across three developmental time-points. By
documenting TE acquisition in a sample of thirty-four French–English
bilingual children at ;, ;, and ;, our goal was to gain a better
understanding of how young bilinguals acquire TEs during a period of
accelerated vocabulary growth. A secondary goal of this experiment was to
acquire a better understanding of how changes in bilingual
input and
relative vocabulary size shape TE development, by examining the relation
between changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size, and
the proportion of TEs. The aim of the second experiment presented in
this paper was to investigate the utility of a direct measure of TE
comprehension, and to compare the proportion of TEs derived from this
measure with parent report of the same subset of words. Within the
vocabulary development
there has been some concern that
parents of bilingual children might confound their child’s languages when
reporting their
receptive word knowledge on vocabulary checklists
(Pearson et al., ) such as the CDI (Fenson et al., ; Trudeau,
Frank & Poulin-Dubois, ). The goal of this second experiment was to
determine whether parent report of TEs mirrors a direct, laboratory-based
measure of children’s TE development.

literature,

Language exposure
The amount of time that a child is exposed to each of his or her languages
appears to be signiﬁcantly related to vocabulary development
in each
language, with discrepancies in language exposure often leading to unbalanced
vocabulary development (Bedore et al., ; Bosch & Ramon-Casas, ;
David & Wei, ; De Anda, Arias-Trejo, Poulin-Dubois, Zesiger & Friend,
a; De Houwer, ; De Houwer, Bornstein & De Coster, ; Eilers,
Pearson & Cobo-Lewis, ; Grüter, Hurtado, Marchman & Fernald, ;
Hoﬀ, ; Hurtado, Grüter, Marchman & Fernald, ; Pearson et al.,
; Place & Hoﬀ, ; Poulin-Dubois et al., ; Thordardottir, ).
Several studies, for example, now show that young bilinguals tend to produce
fewer words in each of their individual languages compared to monolingual
infants (Core, Hoﬀ, Rumiche & Señor, ; Hoﬀ, Core, Place, Rumiche,
Señor & Parra, ; Hoﬀ, Rumiche, Burridge, Ribot & Welsh, ; Oller,
Pearson & Cobo-Lewis, ; Pearson, Fernández & Oller, ).
Furthermore, when exposure is unbalanced, children also have a tendency
to produce more words in their dominant
(L) compared to their
non-dominant (L) language (Hurtado et al., ; Pearson & Fernández,
; Pearson et al., ). Interestingly, however, when total

number of words a child knows) or total conceptual (the number of

concepts a child knows) vocabulary are taken into account, bilinguals are
typically considered to produce as many words as their monolingual peers
(Core et al., ; Hoﬀ et al., ; Junker & Stockman, ; Pearson
et al., ).

Given that it is well established that language exposure has a signiﬁcant
impact on early vocabulary development, it is reasonable to think that the
relative distribution of exposure in each language might also have an
impact on the proportion of TEs that a child acquires. However, whereas
balanced exposure should theoretically result in balanced rates of TE
acquisition, most children are not equally exposed to the languages that
they hear (Hoﬀ, ). Recent research has shown that although many
parents make an eﬀort to provide balanced levels of exposure for their
one-parent–
children,
one-language rule are not eﬀective in achieving this goal (De Houwer,
). Other factors, such as the language preference of the child, the
majority status of the child’s languages, the contexts in which they learn
their languages, and individual diﬀerences in the quantity and quality of
input speakers provide for the child, all contribute to uneven exposure
patterns and, very often, uneven patterns of vocabulary growth (De
Houwer, ; MacLeod, Fabiano-Smith, Boegner-Pagé & Fontolliet,
; Place & Hoﬀ, ).

Interestingly, although most bilingual children have at least some TEs in
their early receptive and expressive vocabularies (Bosch & Ramon-Casas,
; Byers-Heinlein & Werker, ; De Houwer et al., ; Deuchar &
Quay, ; Genesee & Nicoladis, ; Holowka, Brosseau-Lapre &
Petitto, ; Junker & Stockman, ; Nicoladis & Secco, ; Pearson
et al., ; Pearson et al., ; Quay, ; Schelletter, ), there
continues to be some debate in the literature regarding the extent to which
quantity of language exposure plays a role in facilitating TE acquisition.
Whereas there is evidence to suggest that children who are raised in
environments that are more conducive to balanced language acquisition
tend to acquire a greater proportion of TEs early on in development
(David & Wei, ; Montanari, ; Pearson et al., ), there are also
studies showing that quantity of L exposure is a poor predictor of how
many TEs a child has in their vocabulary (Byers-Heinlein & Werker, ;
Lanvers, ; Poulin-Dubois, D., Blaye, Coutya & Bialystok, ). Of
note is the fact that although there is a great deal of individual variability
in the proportion of TEs that a child acquires, we know that TE
acquisition generally increases over time in relation to children’s vocabulary
production (Montanari, ). However, although several studies have now
examined the process of TE acquisition in young bilinguals, the majority
of these studies have been cross-sectional in nature, and few have examined
the role that changes in language exposure and vocabulary ratios play in

facilitating the acquisition of TEs longitudinally in the course of early
vocabulary development. A main goal of the present study was to examine
how changes in relative language exposure and vocabulary size impact TE
acquisition in very young bilinguals using a longitudinal design.

Measuring TE acquisition during infancy
To date, the majority of research on TE acquisition in young bilinguals has
been conducted using case studies and parent report measures, such as the
CDI (David & Wei, ; De Houwer et al., ; Junker & Stockman,
; Legacy, Zesiger, Friend & Poulin-Dubois, ). Although the CDI
is well established as a valid and reliable measure of vocabulary
development in both monolingual and bilingual infants, and is praised for
its quick and easy to use format, there has been some concern that parents
of bilingual infants might confound their child’s languages when reporting
their word knowledge on vocabulary checklists (Pearson et al., ).
Importantly, although the CDI should ideally be ﬁlled out by two expert
reporters, in the case of bilingual infants this is not always possible, and
most often it is the primary caregiver who ﬁlls out both forms of the CDI.
Interestingly, De Houwer, Bornstein, and Leach () showed that single
children’s

RECEPTIVE vocabulary knowledge. This suggests that inaccurate reporting of
vocabulary knowledge by single reporters might also aﬀect bilingual
vocabulary estimates, as this task is much more complex for parents of
bilingual children. Whereas trying to diﬀerentiate the words that a bilingual
child SAYS in each of their languages can be diﬃcult for parents (Lust et al.,
), trying to diﬀerentiate the words that a child COMPREHENDS in each
language can be even more challenging. As a result, Experiment  was
conducted to address this issue. By assessing the proportion of TEs that
infants comprehended using a direct, touch-screen measure of vocabulary
comprehension, and comparing these results to parent report of the same
subsets of words on the CDI, we were able to determine how accurately
parents were able to report on their child’s early comprehension of TEs.

The present study
In order to address gaps in the literature surrounding the acquisition of TEs
in early bilingual vocabulary development, two studies were conducted.
Experiment  had two main goals: (i) to gain a better understanding of
how French–English bilinguals acquire TEs over time, by examining
changes in the proportion of TEs on the CDI across three developmental
time-points; and (ii) to determine the roles that linguistic input and
vocabulary growth play in shaping TE acquisition. In order to accomplish
these goals, TEs in infants’ expressive vocabularies were measured at ;,

hypothesized that more balanced ratios of exposure and productive

that parents may be under- or over-reporting their

In accomplishing these goals, we aimed to acquire a better understanding
not only of what TE acquisition looks like during early bilingual vocabulary
development, but also how changes in input and relative vocabulary size
shape this development, and how we can best measure the acquisition of
TEs in bilingual infants’ receptive vocabularies. By using a longitudinal

Participants
Participants were recruited through birth lists provided by a governmental
health agency in Montréal, Canada. In order to be eligible for each study,
bilingual participants were required to be French–English bilinguals from
birth, and needed to have at least % exposure to their second language.
Exposure to a third language, if any, was below %.

Participants from Experiment  attended three waves of data collection,
beginning at ;. However, due to the longitudinal nature of the study,
only children who contributed data at all three waves were included in the
ﬁnal sample. At Wave  of data collection, ﬁfty-seven infants participated
in the study. However, four children whose parents failed to return the
vocabulary checklists were excluded. Participants who completed Wave 
of data collection were then asked to return six months later for Wave
. At this wave, a total of thirteen additional children were excluded due
to missing data (n = ) or no longer meeting the language requirements for
the study (n = ). Wave  of data collection occurred seven months after
participants returned for Wave . At this wave, six additional participants
were excluded due to missing data (n = ) or no longer meeting language
requirements (n = ).

The ﬁnal cross-wave sample consisted of thirty-four bilinguals ( males
and  females). At Wave , children ranged in age from ;· to ;·
(M = ;·) and were exposed to their non-dominant language an average
of % of the time (M = %, SD = %, Range = –%). At Wave ,
children ranged in age from ;· to ;· (M = ;·), with a mean
level of L exposure of % (M = %, SD = %, Range = –%).
Finally, at Wave  children ranged in age from ;· to ;·
(M = ;·), with a mean level of L exposure at % (SD = %, Range =

Materials

Language Exposure Assessment Tool (LEAT). This questionnaire has been
used in previous studies to measure infants’ exposure to the languages that
they hear (De Anda, Bosch, Poulin-Dubois, Zesiger & Friend, b).
The experimenter conducted an interview with a parent at each wave of
data collection, to ask who communicates with the child on a weekly basis
(e.g. parents, educator, grandparents, etc.), what languages they speak to
the child, and for how long. These data were then entered into an
electronic form, and an estimate of the proportion of time that the child is
exposed to each language was then calculated at ;, ;, and ;,
respectively.

CDI: Words and Gestures. The CDI: WG is a vocabulary checklist that is
completed by parents, and which measures infants’ receptive and expressive
vocabulary at ; to ;. The American English (Fenson et al., ) and
French Canadian (Trudeau et al., ) adaptations were used to measure
vocabulary, with the English and French Canadian adaptations containing
 and  words, respectively. There are a total of  TE pairs on this
form of the CDI.

CDI: Words and Sentences. The CDI: WS is a parent report vocabulary
checklist that measures toddlers’ expressive vocabulary, from ; to ;.
The English and French Canadian adaptations (Fenson et al., ;
Trudeau et al., ) contain  and  words, respectively, and include
 TE pairs.

Procedure
Expert speakers (parents, grandparents, educators, etc.) who spoke to the
children in each language were asked to ﬁll out the CDI in English or
French at each wave, and two calculations were performed: one to obtain
an estimate of the proportion of TEs including cognates (words that are
similar in both spelling and sound, such as pizza and pizza or jeans and
jeans) and semi-cognates (words that are similar in sound but diﬀer slightly
in spelling, such as banana and banane or mittens and mitaines), and one to

obtain an estimate of
the proportion of TEs excluding cognates and
semi-cognates. First, the total proportion of TEs including cognates and
semi-cognates was calculated by summing the number of identiﬁed TE
pairs on the CDIs and multiplying this score by two. This number was
then divided by the child’s total vocabulary minus non-equivalents (words
that have no translation on the other CDI form). A second proportion
excluding cognates and semi-cognates was then calculated by summing the
identiﬁed TE pairs on the CDIs, subtracting all cognate and semi-cognate
pairs, and multiplying by two. This number was then divided by the child’s
total vocabulary minus cognates, semi-cognates, and non-equivalents.

Importantly, TE pairs (including both cognates and semi-cognates) on
each of the CDI forms were identiﬁed by two independent and fully
bilingual raters. These raters then came to an agreement on which words
from each form would be selected as pairs. They also came to a consensus
on which TEs would be classiﬁed as cognate or semi-cognate pairs. Given
that both the English and French forms contained a limited number of
synonyms, it was decided that children would be given credit for one TE
pair, even if they knew synonymous words for the same concept (e.g. sofa
and couch in English and divan and sofa in French).

After completing these calculations, a one-way ANOVA was conducted to
compare the total proportion of TEs at each wave, and correlations were
computed to examine the relation between relative exposure, vocabulary
size, and the proportion of TEs across time-points. In order to investigate
the impact of changes in exposure and relative vocabulary size on TE
development, a hierarchical regression was also performed to determine
the best predictor of change at each wave of data collection. Given that no
major diﬀerences were found between analyses using the total TE
proportion and analyses using the proportion of TEs minus cognates and
semi-cognates, all reported statistics are taken from analyses using the total
proportion of TEs. However, descriptive data have been included for the
proportion of TEs with cognates and semi-cognates subtracted at each wave.

At Wave , the proportion of TEs was calculated using data from the CDI:
WG. The mean proportion of TEs in bilinguals’ expressive vocabulary at ;
was % (with cognates and semi-cognates removed M = %). At Waves 
and , however, the proportion of TEs was calculated using results from
the CDI: WS. The mean proportion of TEs in bilinguals’ expressive
vocabulary at Wave  of data collection was % (with cognates and
semi-cognates removed M = %), with it notably increasing to %
(with cognates and semi-cognates removed M = %) by Wave  (see

TEs from Wave  to Wave  as they did from Wave  to Wave , when
considering both the total proportion of TEs at each wave, as well as the
proportion of new TEs acquired across waves (i.e. new TEs divided by
new words added to children’s vocabulary across each -month period).
Importantly, children signiﬁcantly increased the proportion of TEs in
their vocabularies by % between ; and ; (F(,) = ·, p = ·),
with the proportion of TEs that infants acquired at Wave  being positively
correlated with the same proportion of TEs measured at Wave  and at
Wave  (see Table ). This suggests that there is stability in the proportion
of TEs and their rate of acquisition in children’s vocabularies.

Factors inﬂuencing TE acquisition in young bilinguals
In order to examine the extent to which language exposure ratios impact TE
acquisition in our sample of young bilinguals, ratios for vocabulary size and
language exposure were calculated by dividing L raw scores by L raw
scores for each variable (Hurtado et al., ). Log transformations were
then applied to these ratios (with smaller values being associated with
more balanced exposure and vocabulary size), and bivariate correlations
were run using these relative measures (see Table ).

Importantly, and as expected, relative exposure was correlated with
relative vocabulary size at Waves  and  of data collection, with a trend
toward the same result at Wave . Relative exposure also tended to be
correlated across waves, with a trend toward the same result for relative
vocabulary. This suggests moderate stability in both relative language
exposure and vocabulary size over time. More importantly, both relative
exposure and relative vocabulary size were correlated with the total
proportion of TEs in children’s vocabularies at Waves  and , such that
children with more balanced ratios of exposure and vocabulary exhibited a
greater proportion of TEs in their vocabulary. Although these results did
not reach signiﬁcance at Wave , the correlations were in the expected
direction. Because
children were only beginning to develop their
productive vocabularies at this stage of development, and several children
had not yet acquired TEs in their vocabularies, it is possible that there
simply was not enough variability in the data to produce strong
correlations at this wave.

In order to assess the impact of changes in relative exposure and
vocabulary size on change in the proportion of TEs across waves, two
regression analyses were conducted, one each for TE development from
; to ; and from ; to ;. The ﬁrst examined the predictive ability
of changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size on TE
development between ; and ;. Importantly, change in relative
vocabulary size accounted for % of the variance in change across waves,

and emerged as the best predictor in the model. Children who exhibited
more balanced rates of vocabulary growth (i.e. adding approximately as
many new words in L as they did in L across waves) accumulated more
new TEs across waves (ΔF(,) = ·, p = ·; see Table ). The second
regression examined the predictive ability of changes in language exposure
and relative vocabulary size on TE development between ; and ;.
The results once again indicated that changes in the ratio of L:L
vocabulary size best predicted change in the proportion of TEs across
waves, such that children who exhibited more balanced rates of acquisition
accumulated more new TEs (ΔF(,) = ·, p < ·). Change in relative
vocabulary size accounted for an additional % of the variance in TE
acquisition across waves above and beyond change in relative exposure.

Importantly, change in language exposure accounted for only % of the
variance in TE development from Wave  to Wave , and % of the
variance from Wave  to Wave . Although change in exposure did not
emerge as a signiﬁcant predictor of change in the proportion of TEs from
; to ; and from ; to ; on its own, it was a signiﬁcant predictor
of such changes across ; and ; when change in relative vocabulary
size was also taken into account.

These results suggest that although change in relative language exposure is
a moderating factor in the model, it is the ratio of words learned that has the
greatest impact on TE development. The fact that having a more balanced

rate of vocabulary acquisition was predictive of TE development across each
-month period is to be expected, as it provides more opportunities to
acquire TE pairs. However, the fact that language exposure per se is not a
signiﬁcant predictor of this development suggests that it is children’s
ability to utilize the input in their environment to learn new words that
matters the most with respect to TE development.

Although change in relative exposure was signiﬁcantly correlated with
change in relative vocabulary from ; to ; (r() = ·, p = ·), this
was not the case from ; to ; (r() = –·, p = ·). This suggests
that there may be more inherent error in parents’ report of language
exposure or vocabulary size at Wave , perhaps due to more children
entering day care or preschool settings.

EXPERIMENT 

M E T H O D S
The purpose of this second experiment was to compare a direct measure of
children’s TE comprehension with parent report of the same subset of
words. We conducted this experiment to test the hypothesis that parents
might under- or over-report TE comprehension.

Participants
Participants were recruited through birth lists provided by a governmental
health agency in Montréal, Canada. Once again, in order to be eligible for
each study, bilingual participants were required to be French–English
bilinguals from birth, and needed to have at least % exposure to their
second language. Exposure to a third language, if any, was below %. A
total of twenty-two bilingual participants were tested. Of these twenty-two
toddlers, two were excluded due to missing vocabulary measures. The

Computerized Comprehension Task (CCT). The CCT (Friend &
Keplinger, ) is a laboratory-based measure that assesses a child’s
receptive vocabulary in French and English by presenting two images
simultaneously on a touch screen and asking the child to touch the target
image when prompted (e.g. “Where is the chair? Touch chair.”). Test
trials consisted of forty pairs of images that were accompanied by auditory
reinforcement when the child correctly touched a target image. This task
is available in French, English, and Spanish, and was originally intended
for monolingual children. Consequently, there were very few pairs of TEs
incorporated into the original English and French CCT adaptations.
Therefore, this task was adapted to obtain versions that would contain
only words with the same meaning in both languages (e.g. diaper in
English and couche in French). The pairs of images consisted of nouns (
pairs), verbs ( pairs), and adjectives ( pairs), and corresponded to
words included on the CDI (Friend, Schmitt & Simpson, ). Each
image appeared on the screen for seven seconds, and pairs of images were
balanced for diﬃculty, brightness, word class,
and size.
Additionally, the test trials diﬀered in diﬃculty level (easy, moderately
diﬃcult, and diﬃcult). Word diﬃculty level was established based on
normative parent data from the CDI: WG (Dale & Fenson, ). The
proportion of TEs for each child was calculated by summing the total
number of correctly identiﬁed TE pairs, multiplying this number by two,
and dividing by the total number of correctly identiﬁed words on the
CCT in both languages. Twenty-ﬁve percent of the sample was coded by
a second coder to determine inter-rater reliability. Inter-rater reliability
was excellent, with a Pearson correlation of . for the English task and
. for the French task.

Computerized Comprehension Task Checklist (CCT Checklist). This
checklist was created for the purpose of this study. There is an English as
well as a French version, both of which include the same set of words

Ninety percent of parents who completed the CCT checklist spoke both
English and French.

Procedure
Parents and children came in for two visits, scheduled approximately one
week apart. On the ﬁrst visit, there was a warm-up period for the child to
become acquainted with the experimenter. During this period,
the
experimenter explained the study, and parents were asked to read and sign
the written consent form. Afterwards, parents were asked to complete the
CCT Checklist in both English and French. Upon completion of the
questionnaires, the experimenter administered either the French or the
English CCT. The
task was
counterbalanced across children. Before starting the CCT, the child was
seated on his/her parent’s lap, in order to be able to reach the screen.
Parents were also asked to wear a pair of darkened glasses to prevent
inadvertently cuing their child during administration of the CCT. On the
second visit, the experimenter administered the CCT in the language that
was not administered on the ﬁrst visit. Parents were compensated with
$, and toddlers received a gift at each visit, in addition to a certiﬁcate of
merit.

The results from the present study suggest that parents tend to over-report
the number of TEs in their child’s vocabulary. Parents reported that children
had signiﬁcantly more TEs on the CCT checklist than children showed
knowledge of on the CCT (t() = ·, p = ·; see Table ). That is,
parents reported that their children knew on average % more TEs than
they showed comprehension of on a direct measure of
receptive
vocabulary. Importantly, although TEs on the CCT were not signiﬁcantly
correlated with parents’ report of children’s TE comprehension,
the
correlation was in the expected direction (see Table ).

sample of children. Whereas a signiﬁcant
correlation emerged between relative exposure and parents’ report of TEs,
no such correlation emerged between relative exposure and TEs as
measured by the CCT. Moreover, although both measures of TE
acquisition were positively correlated with L vocabulary size, no
signiﬁcant correlations emerged between relative vocabulary size and the
proportion of TEs.

The fact that a discrepancy was observed between parent report and a
direct measure of TEs suggests that parents may experience diﬃculty in
reporting on their child’s comprehension of words across languages.

TEs as measured by the CCT, suggests that parents may be drawing upon
their sense of children’s relative language exposure in order to report on
vocabulary knowledge. Parents may also be using a more lenient criterion
for comprehension than what is required of children on the CCT.

The main goals of the present study were: (i) to investigate the development
of TEs in a sample of young bilinguals across three developmental
time-points; (ii) to examine whether relative language exposure contributes
to early TE acquisition in these children; and (iii)
to examine the
convergence of a direct measure of TE acquisition with parental report, in
order to test the hypothesis that parents may be under- or over-reporting
the number of TEs in children’s vocabularies.

The results from the ﬁrst experiment indicate that by ;, most children
have TEs in their productive vocabulary, although there is a large degree
of variability across children. This is in line with previous research
showing that TE acquisition begins early in development, typically during
the ﬁrst year while children are still developing their receptive lexicons
(Bosch & Ramon-Casas, ; Byers-Heinlein & Werker, ; De
Houwer et al., ; Deuchar & Quay, ; Genesee & Nicoladis, ;
Holowka et al., ; Junker & Stockman, ; Nicoladis & Secco, ;
Pearson et al., ; Pearson et al., ; Quay, ; Schelletter, ).
It is important to note, however, that the mean proportions of TEs
reported at ;, ;, and ; in the current study are somewhat higher than
what has typically been observed in the literature (approximately %).
One possibility for this discrepancy is the diﬀerences in the methodologies
that have been used in the literature to measure the proportion of TEs.
Four out of ten studies that have reported quantitative data on the
presence of TEs in the lexicons of young bilinguals have used audiovisual
recordings or diary entries to record data (Deuchar & Quay, ;
Holowka et al., ; Nicoladis & Secco, ; Schelletter, ). These
studies, conducted with both infants and toddlers, reported means of %,
%, %, and % TEs, respectively. The other six studies reported in
the literature used parent report measures, such as the CDI and the
Language Development Survey (LDS). Although Byers-Heinlein and
Werker () and Pearson et al. () reported means of % and %
TEs, respectively, using the CDI to measure vocabulary, Poulin-Dubois
et al. () reported a mean of %, and David and Wei () reported
up to % TEs using the CDI. Moreover, Junker and Stockman ()
reported a mean TE proportion of nearly % using the LDS, suggesting
that the mean proportion of TEs observed in children’s vocabularies may
in part be a function of the measure that is used. It would appear that
vocabulary checklists such as the CDI and LDS might provide more
opportunities for TEs to be quantiﬁed than direct audiovisual measures
and diary entries, which are dependent on children producing TEs in
order for them to be quantiﬁed.

Moreover, in the present study, % of our sample in Experiment 
received input in their second language more than % of the time at
Wave , and % of our sample received similar input in their second
language across Waves  and  of data collection. Although the quantity of
second-language exposure in the present study does not appear to diﬀer
signiﬁcantly from other similar studies in the literature, the fact that most
children had fairly balanced rates of exposure to each of their languages
may have contributed to the larger proportion of TEs that was observed.
This, in conjunction with the fact that most parents were bilingual, often
speaking both English and French regularly, may have in turn provided

these children with additional opportunities to learn TEs. Furthermore,
although the oﬃcial language of Montréal is French, it is predominantly a
bilingual city, with children frequently being exposed to English and
French both at home and in the community. Importantly, although all of
these factors may have facilitated the acquisition of TEs in our sample, it
is also reasonable to believe that the means reported here are simply
products of individual variability, with our sample containing children
with higher overall rates of TE acquisition than has been reported
previously. However, the observed eﬀect of relative vocabulary size on TE
acquisition argues in favor of the former interpretation.

Importantly, given the longitudinal nature of the present study, we were
able to show that TE acquisition appears to increase gradually along with
total vocabulary size, and that rates of growth are fairly stable across the
second year. By ;,
relations emerged between relative
exposure and vocabulary size and the proportion of TEs in children’s
vocabularies. These relations showed that children with a more balanced
exposure typically developed more balanced vocabulary sizes in each of
their languages, which in turn facilitated the acquisition of TEs. This is in
line with previous
the
proportion of TEs in children’s vocabularies (David & Wei, ;
Montanari, ; Pearson et al., ). The ﬁnding that RELATIVE
exposure is associated with RELATIVE vocabulary size, however, is in line
with recent reports by Hurtado and colleagues (). Importantly, both
Hurtado et al.
() have suggested that
correlating relative measures, such as language exposure, with raw scores,
such as the number of words in a child’s productive vocabulary, often
distorts the relation between input and vocabulary size. To our knowledge,
the present study is the ﬁrst to show that TE acquisition is directly related
to both relative exposure and relative vocabulary size.

() and Grüter et al.

In addition to examining the relation between relative language exposure,
relative vocabulary size, and proportion of TEs at each wave, we also aimed
to investigate how changes in these aspects of vocabulary development might
impact change in the proportion of TEs across waves. Importantly, change in
relative vocabulary size, as opposed to change in relative language exposure,
emerged as a main predictor of TE development across waves. More
speciﬁcally, more balanced rates of word growth seemed to facilitate the
acquisition of TEs across each developmental time-point. Furthermore,
although changes
in relative language exposure appeared to predict
changes in vocabulary ratios across ; and ;, this was not the case
across ; and ;. These data suggest that a greater degree of error may
exist for parents’ report of exposure and vocabulary size at this later
developmental time-point, or that factors other than language exposure
may be driving children’s acquisition of new words in each of their

children’s language preferences in the present study, it is possible that
these factors are playing a larger role in vocabulary growth at this stage of
development.

The second experiment in this study aimed to examine the convergence of
a direct measure of TE comprehension and parent report of the same subset
of words. To date, the majority of studies examining TE development in
young bilingual children have used parent report measures, such as the
MacArthur Bates CDI. Although such measures are well established as
providing
vocabulary
development, it is possible that parents of bilingual children may have
more diﬃculty diﬀerentiating word knowledge in each of their child’s
languages when reporting on these measures, ultimately leading to under-
or over-reporting of TEs. This issue may be even more salient for parents
when they are asked to report on their child’s comprehension of words, as
opposed to their production, which is often much more evident and
explicit for parents.

Interestingly, two studies comparing parent report of word comprehension
with a looking-time measure in samples of monolingual infants aged ;
provided conﬂicting results. Whereas the ﬁrst study of this nature showed
that parents have a tendency to underestimate infants’ comprehension on
the CDI (Houston-Price, Mather & Sakkalou, ), the second study,
which used the same tasks and procedure but diﬀerent stimuli, found that
parents are able to accurately assess infants’ comprehension of words (Styles
& Plunkett, ). Although both studies were conducted with samples of
British children aged ;, Houston-Price et al., used known and FAMILIAR
word pairs, and Styles and Plunkett used known and UNFAMILIAR word
pairs in their stimuli. Moreover, whereas Houston-Price et al., attempted to
address issues such as object preference in their looking-time procedure by
presenting word pairs more than once, Styles and Plunkett only presented
each word pair once in an attempt to determine whether the familiarity of
the distracter image impacts children’s looking patterns. In doing so, they
found that parents’ report of comprehension on the CDI was an accurate
predictor of looking time. They also suggested that the threshold for which
parents mark an item on the CDI as understood is when an infant is able to
correctly identify the target with only one presentation, in an unfamiliar
environment, and in the presence of potentially confusing distracters (Styles
& Plunkett, , p. ).

comprehension, similar to what was observed for an alternate sample of
bilinguals aged ; who were administered the original version of the CCT
(Legacy et al., ). Although it is possible that the CCT may be

is
unlikely. It is possible that the over-reporting of TEs in Experiment  is

and
non-dominant languages when reporting on comprehension. However, it is
also possible that parents may be picking up on children’s partial
comprehension of words. Unlike parent report, the CCT removes context
from the assessment of children’s understanding of words, which means
that partial mappings of words that are still largely dependent on context
and have not yet been generalized are likely not accounted for in children’s
accuracy scores on this task. That is, parents may observe behavioral
markers of these contextually based partial mappings, but children are
unable to generalize this basic understanding on measures such as the
CCT, which removes
study comparing
looking-time measures with touching behavior on the CCT showed that
children’s responding reﬂected these partial mappings, with a full mapping
typically being characterized by a correct touch to the target, a partial
mapping typically characterized by a look to the target, but a touch to the
distractor and no mapping characterized by the infant refraining from
touching the screen (Hendrickson, Mitsven, Poulin-Dubois, Zesiger &
Friend, ). As a result, it is possible that Houston-Price and colleagues
() are picking up on these partial mappings in their study due to
using only familiar items. Moreover, as mentioned by Styles and Plunkett
(),
is unclear how exactly parents deﬁne comprehension of a
particular word when completing the CDI. They also, however, suggest
that whereas British parents appeared to be using the threshold stated
above, parents from other countries may not be as stringent in their
criteria for what constitutes comprehension. This was also suggested by
Houston-Price and colleagues, who noted that
there is research that
indicates that North American parents may be more likely to over-report
children’s word knowledge on the CDI (Hamilton, Plunkett & Schafer,
; Tomasello & Mervis, ). The fact
that CDI reporting of
comprehension appears to diﬀer to some extent based on parental deﬁnition
of word understanding and other cultural factors emphasizes the importance
of using direct measures of early vocabulary comprehension in conjunction
with parent report to acquire a much more comprehensive understanding of
early vocabulary development and TE acquisition in young bilinguals.

In addition to investigating the convergence between the children’s
comprehension of TEs on the CCT and parent report, we also examined
whether relative language exposure was able to predict both measures of

TE development in this sample of children. Interestingly, whereas a
signiﬁcant correlation emerged between relative exposure and parents’
report of TEs, no such correlation emerged between relative exposure and
TEs as measured by the CCT. However, of note is the fact that children’s
performance on the CCT did not correlate with parents’ reports of the
same subset of words. This discrepancy may reﬂect the small sample of
words on the CCT in relation to larger vocabulary inventories such as the
CDI. However, it may also be due to the fact that exposure ratios are
calculated based on reports from parents regarding their language use. It is
likely that parents use these estimates to guide their own reporting of
children’s word knowledge and in this case TEs.

C O N C L U S I O N A N D F U T U R E D I R E C T I O N S
In sum, the present study shows that the acquisition of TEs is a gradual
process that coincides with early bilingual vocabulary development. It also
provides evidence for the relation between quantity of language exposure
and TE development, but shows that the ratio of L to L vocabulary is a
better predictor of TE development than L exposure in young bilinguals.
Last, to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to compare a direct measure
of TE comprehension with parent report during the second year of life.
The ﬁndings from this comparison emphasize the necessity of using
multiple measures of early vocabulary development, including both direct
and indirect measures, to advance our understanding of TE acquisition
early on in development.

No doubt there are several limitations to the present study. Although we
were able to examine the relation between quantity of language exposure
and TE development in Experiment , future research is required to
determine how other input factors, such as context and quality of input,
shape the acquisition of TEs in early bilingual development. Moreover,
this experiment should be replicated with other languages and cultures to
determine if the same pattern of development holds for multiple samples
of bilingual children. The small sample size in Experiment  was also a
limitation of this study, and as a result this experiment should be repeated
with larger samples of children. Replicating this experiment with children
learning diﬀerent languages in diﬀerent cultures may also shed light on
whether the parent report discrepancy observed in this study is linked to
cultural factors, as has been previously suggested in the literature.
