perception of Mandarin tones,
the present study explored how
categorical perception (CP) of Mandarin tones emerges along age
among  four- to seven-year-old children and  adults. Prominent
discrimination peaks were found for both the child and the adult
groups,
corresponding
identiﬁcation crossovers. Moreover, six-year-olds showed a much
narrower width (i.e. a sharper slope) compared to younger children,
and have already acquired adult-like identiﬁcation competence of
Mandarin high-level and mid-rising tones. Although the ability to
discriminate within-category tone pairs did not change, the between-
category discrimination accuracies were positively correlated with
chronological ages among child participants. We assume that the
perceptual reﬁnement of Mandarin tones in young children may be
driven by an accumulation of perceptual development from the tonal
information of the ambient sound input.

I N T R O D U C T I O N
Detailed research into the biological foundations of language in the context of
growth and maturation – including babbling around six months of age to the
production of full meaningful sentences by the age of three years (e.g. Kuhl,
; Saﬀran, Werker & Werner, ) – has led some to suggest that young
children have innate dispositions and incredible abilities to learn any natural
language (Lenneberg, ). Although newborns begin life with the ability
to discriminate both native and non-native phonological contrasts attested in
the world’s languages (e.g. Best & Tyler, ; Eimas, Siqueland, Jusczyk
& Vigorito, ; Polka & Werker, ; Streeter, ; Werker & Tees,
),
their ability to discriminate non-native consonants and vowels
gradually declines between  and  months as a result of consistent
exposure to a speciﬁc language (e.g. Best & McRoberts, ; Best,
McRoberts, LaFleur & Silver-Isenstadt, ; Werker & Tees, ),
whereas similar ability to discriminate native consonants and vowels are
maintained and enhanced over the same time period (Kuhl, Stevens,
Hayashi, Deguchi, Kiritani & Iverson, ). The language-dependent
perceptual reorganization during infancy with perceptual narrowing for the
native phonological contrasts is considered to be largely attributable to
‘statistical learning’: tracking the frequencies of the exposed sound tokens
and using this information to tune into native phonological categories (Best
& McRoberts, ; Kuhl, ; Maye, Werker & Gerken, ).

Such phonological contrasts of diﬀerent spoken languages can be divided
into segmental units, including consonants and vowels, and suprasegmental

units, such as stresses and tones. Almost –% of the world’s languages are
tone languages (Yip, ), and over half of the world’s people speak a tone
language (Fromkin, ). Many studies on infant tone perception have
revealed that the process of perceptual reorganization is shaped by the
ambient tonal language. In one longitudinal case study, the perceptual
discrimination of Cantonese tones was found to begin at the tenth month
(Tse, ). In another study by Mattock and Burnham (), infants
were tested on their ability to discriminate Thai tone contrasts. Results
indicated that English-exposed infants demonstrated attenuation in tone
sensitivity between  and  months, while Chinese-learning infants
exhibited a sustained sensitivity to Thai tones over this period. Moreover,
developmental changes in tone perception were systematically explored by
Yeung, Chen, and Werker
results demonstrated that
language experience might aﬀect the perception of lexical tones as early as
 months: English-, Cantonese-, and Mandarin-exposed infants each
demonstrated diﬀerent discrimination abilities that accorded with the
properties of their native language at this stage. This study suggests that
the formation of tone categories evolves earlier than that for vowels and
consonants. What was previously regarded as a language-general stage of
phonological development (from birth to  months) appears not to be so
for infants with tone languages as their mother tongue.

Modern Mandarin is a tone language with relatively simple syllable
structure (see Figure ). Each syllable must be attached with one of the
four lexical tones distinguishing diﬀerent meanings (Tone : high-level
tone; Tone : mid-rising tone; Tone : low-falling-rising tone; and Tone
: high-falling tone). Lexical tones and nuclear vowels are compulsory
elements for Mandarin syllables, whereas the onsets and the ending
and Dodd ()
consonants
systematically studied the production of Mandarin among one-
to
four-year-old children,
reporting that children acquired phonological
elements in the following order: tones were acquired ﬁrst, followed by
vowels and syllable-ﬁnal consonants, which were then followed by
syllable-initial consonants. The phonological saliency hypothesis (Hua &
Dodd, ) might account for the order of phonological production in
Mandarin, with Mandarin tones being the most salient. Moreover, in a
large-scale population-based production study with children aged two to
twelve years (To, Cheung & McLeod, ), results also showed that tone
production was early acquired, followed by vowels and then by consonants.
Earlier studies (e.g. Chao, ; Clumeck, ; Hua, ; Hua & Dodd,
; Li & Tompson, ) have indicated that lexical tones are produced
early, with considerable accuracy before age three. Judgments of tone
errors in these studies were typically made by native adult observers in a
categorical fashion (correct or incorrect). However, it is important to note

that the aforementioned early production of tones in children before three
years of age does not mean that these children have the same abilities of
tonal production as do adults. Innovations in speech analysis tools have
aﬀorded greater precision in the evaluation of early tone productions. A
series of studies (Wong, , ; Wong, Schwartz & Jenkins, )
have reported that three- to ﬁve-year-old preschoolers have not yet fully
mastered the production of Mandarin tones. None of the Mandarin tones
produced by the three-
to ﬁve-year-old children reached adult-like
accuracy, suggesting a protracted course of development extending beyond
age ﬁve. Moreover, Yang, Diehl, and Davis ()
investigated the
duration of Mandarin tones produced by ﬁve-, eight-, and twelve-year-old
monolingual Mandarin-speaking children and young adults. Although
ﬁve- and eight-year-olds have already established lexical contrasts of
Mandarin tones, adult-like tone production is still developing, with tone
duration approximating adult values only in twelve-year-old children.
These ﬁndings stood in contrast to earlier studies that claim very early
acquisition of stable tone productions (Chao, ; Clumeck, ; Hua,
; Hua & Dodd, ; Li & Tompson, ). Furthermore, Wong’s
studies suggested that tones did not necessarily mature in advance of
vowels and consonants in production (Wong, , ).

For Mandarin tone perception, although the study of three-year-old children
suggests they already show relatively high perceptual accuracy (around %) of
all four Mandarin tones (Wong et al., ), research on the developmental
course of categorical perception (CP) of Mandarin tones is still lacking. The
study of CP is useful because it oﬀers a much more reﬁned perceptual
method to track the course of maturation and stabilization in children’s
ﬁne-grained perception of Mandarin tones beyond age three.

CP is one of the most extensively studied phenomena in speech perception
over the past ﬁfty years. It is important in cognitive science because it reﬂects

the adaptation of the perceptual system to facilitate categorization among
complicated variants that an organism needs to make in its environment
(Goldstone & Hendrickson, ). In the auditory modality of speech
perception, CP refers to the fact that listeners rapidly map continuous
acoustic signals onto discrete phonological categories, resulting in better
discrimination of stimuli across the category boundary than of equivalently
separated stimuli within the same category (Liberman, Harris, Hoﬀman &
Griﬃth, ). While the great bulk of literature on CP deals with the
segmental
(e.g. Fry, Abramson,
Eimas & Liberman, ; Harnad, ; Johnson & Ralston, ;
Liberman, Harris, Kinney & Lane, ; Miller & Eimas, ; Nenonen,
Shestakova, Huotilainen & Näätänen, ), there has been a recent surge
of research into whether CP applies to the suprasegmental level, such as
lexical tone contrasts in tone languages (e.g. Bent, Bradlow & Wright,
; Bidelman, Gandour & Krishnan, ; Francis, Ciocca & Ng, ;
Gandour, Wong & Hutchins, ; Hallé, Chang & Best, ; Peng,
Deutsch, Henthorn, Su & Wang, ; Peng, Zheng, Gong, Yang, Kong
& Wang, ; Wang, ; Xu, Gandour & Francis, ).

features (i.e. consonants and vowels)

On the whole, studies on the CP of lexical tones in adults have mainly
focused on two aspects: the inﬂuence of language experience (cross-language
or cross-dialect), and diﬀerent domains (music vs. speech vs. non-speech).
Speciﬁcally, for Mandarin tone perception, there is ample evidence that
adult Mandarin listeners not only show a sharp boundary (or a steep
transition slope) between the level
tone and the rising tone in the
identiﬁcation function, but they also exhibit a prominent discrimination
peak around the categorical boundary position, indicating a typical CP of
these Mandarin tones (e.g. Peng et al., ; Wang, ; Xu et al., ).

Compared to the extensive research on CP in adults, the progressive
development of CP of Mandarin tones from infancy into childhood has
received relatively little attention (but see Xi, Jiang, Zhang & Shu, ;
Yang & Liu, ; Zhang et al., ). In a behavioral study by Xi et al.
(), healthy ﬁve- to seven-year-old children and adults were tested on
the identiﬁcation of a tone continuum ranging from Mandarin Tone  to
Tone . Their results showed that six-year-old ﬁrst-graders have already
acquired adult-like identiﬁcation competence for these Mandarin tones.
However, due to the lack of an explicit discrimination test, their results
may not be conclusive. In another behavioral study (Yang & Liu, ),
eight Mandarin monolingual children aged from six to eight years (mean
= ·) participated in both tone identiﬁcation and tone discrimination tasks
for tone continua between Tone  and Tone , and between Tone  and
Tone . Mandarin monolingual
children showed sharp categorical
boundaries in the tone identiﬁcation task. However, they did not show
prominent discrimination peaks
around the observed identiﬁcation

six- to eight-year-old children was not as proﬁcient as it was in adults.
Zhang et al. () made use of both behavioral and electrophysiological
measures
children with
age-matched healthy controls. Zhang et al.’s results demonstrated that the
perception of Mandarin high-rising Tone  and falling Tone  was already
categorical among the healthy ten-year-old Chinese children. All in all, the
general course of the development of CP of Mandarin tones in young
children, who are still developing their ability for Mandarin tone
perception, is not yet clear.

ten-year-old Chinese dyslexic

Behavioral tests for CP often require overt responses and sustained
concentrations, which are relatively diﬃcult for young children. This may
be one of the reasons why behavioral research of CP in children is often
limited and inconclusive. In the current study, a picture-pointing method
was adopted to study young children’s responses in both the identiﬁcation
and the discrimination tasks (see ‘Procedure’).

Furthermore, in Mainland China, children normally attend the ﬁrst grade
of primary school at the age of six or seven, where they begin to receive
systematic training in phonological coding (i.e. Pinyin),
including tone
instruction. In other words, under normal conditions, six-year-olds in
kindergarten have little metalinguistic knowledge of Mandarin tones, while
children of the same age who happen to be in the ﬁrst grade typically do
have knowledge of the tone concept. In the study by Xi et al. (),
six-year-olds in ﬁrst grade showed a signiﬁcant enhancement in the tone
identiﬁcation task, which could be potentially attributed to two factors:
physiological maturation at the age of six and/or explicit instruction of
Mandarin tone categories in ﬁrst grade. However, which of these factors
(if either) plays the more important role for the identiﬁcation improvement
has not yet been determined. To shed light on this issue, in the current
study, young children were divided into ﬁve groups: four-, ﬁve-, and
six-year-olds in kindergarten, and six- and seven-year-olds in ﬁrst grade.
Additionally, a control group of Mandarin-speaking young adults was
recruited. It is important to investigate the developmental trajectory of
Mandarin tone perception in the context of physiological growth and tone
education, and,
in particular, the earliest time-point at which children
typically begin to perceive Mandarin tones categorically in the same way
as adults, in both identiﬁcation and discrimination tasks.

criteria on the training trials. Moreover, two children, one each from the

to

All the above-mentioned ﬁve child subjects were excluded and are not
further shown in the current study. Additionally, a control group was
recruited that consisted of sixteen young adults ( females; mean age =
·, SD = · years) from the northern part of China. All participants
were free of self-reported neurological diseases, psychiatric disorders, or
(using a form approved by the
hearing deﬁcits. Informed consent
Behavioral Research Ethics Committee of
the Shenzhen Institutes of
Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) was obtained from
all parents
recruited from two
kindergartens and one primary school, which had students from roughly
equivalent family backgrounds in terms of both socioeconomic status and
the parents’ education levels. Of these,  children were in the four-
year-old group from kindergarten ( girls),  were in the ﬁve-year-old
group from kindergarten ( girls), and  were in the six-year-old group
from kindergarten ( girls). Another  children were also in the
six-year-old group but from a primary school in ﬁrst grade ( girls), and
 were in the seven-year-old group also in ﬁrst grade ( girls). We refer
to these ﬁve groups as: four yr, ﬁve yr, six yr (K), six yr (P), and seven yr
throughout this paper. The non-verbal intelligence of the children had
been assessed by a local administrant hospital before children went to
school, using Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices (Raven, ). All
child participants showed normal non-verbal intelligence. Moreover, since
Gathercole and Baddeley () argued that children with speciﬁc
language impairments (SLI) have reduced phonological storage in their
working memory, every child’s language ability (LA) was screened with
the Test of Language Ability in Preschoolers (Ning, ), which consists
of ﬁve subtests (including grammatical competence, basic vocabulary, and

add method (Moulines & Laroche, ) implemented in Praat (Boersma &
Weenink, ). Since the pitch pattern (i.e. fundamental frequency as its
acoustic correlate) plays the primary role in tone perception in Mandarin
(Kuo, Rosen & Faulkner, ), other acoustic cues which vary greatly in
natural speech (e.g. amplitude, envelope, and duration) were kept constant
among stimuli. The procedures for synthesizing the stimuli followed those
described in Peng et al. (). Figure  shows a schematic diagram of the
pitch contours of the eleven stimuli along the tone continuum (following
Peng et al., ; Wang, ). The F onsets of the target stimuli were
determined by the formula ‘ Hz +  Hz × (Stimulus Number – )’. In
Mandarin, the syllable /i/, when produced with the high-level tone, is a
homophone with ﬁfteen diﬀerent meanings such as ‘clothes’, and is coded
as the typical stimulus #; when /i/ is spoken with the mid-rising tone, it
is another homophone with twenty-four diﬀerent meanings such as ‘aunt’,
which is coded as the typical stimulus #. All the -ms tone stimuli
were presented binaurally at  dB sound pressure level.

Procedure
To help ensure young children would be able to accomplish the whole
identiﬁcation task and discrimination task (lasting  minutes and 
minutes, respectively), the experimental designs were modiﬁed to make
these tasks more manageable for our child participants, and the two tasks
were separately conducted on two successive days.

The identiﬁcation task was conducted on the ﬁrst day. Before the
experiment, a training session was provided to ensure that all the children
could follow the instructions. The experimenter taught them to point at
the left picture on a computer screen (a car driving on a level road) after
playing the stimulus # several times, and to point at the right picture (a
car driving on a rising road) after playing the stimulus # several times.
Only after the children succeeded in pointing at the matched picture each
time they heard stimulus # or # would they progress to the next step.
There was one practice block (including stimuli #, #, #, #, #, #,
#, repeating twice randomly) before the two test blocks to familiarize
children with the identiﬁcation procedure. An identiﬁcation accuracy of

more than % for the practice stimuli close to the two ends of the
continuum (i.e. #, #, #, #) was required to continue to the test
blocks. The eleven stimuli were randomly presented four times each in
each test block. There were two test blocks for a total of eighty-eight test
trials. The entire practice and test blocks were controlled by E-prime. The
experimenter logged the child’s pointing responses by pressing key ‘’ (for
‘Tone ’) on the keyboard when children pointed at the left picture and

The discrimination task was conducted on the following day. During the
training session, the experimenter instructed them to point at the left picture
(a happy face with two identical eyes) representing the same pairs after
playing sound pairs (– or –) several times, and to point at the right
picture (a sad face with two diﬀerent eyes) representing the diﬀerent pairs
after playing the sound pairs (– or –) several times. Only after the
children succeeded in pointing at the matched picture each time they
heard the training sound pairs (–; –; –; –) would they
progress to the experiment. The practice block contained twelve pairs

by two steps (i.e.  Hz), in either forward (–, –, – . . . –, –)

testing pairs in total. The experimenter pressed ‘v’ (for ‘same’) on the
keyboard when children pointed at the smiling picture and pressed ‘n’ (for
‘diﬀerent’) when children pointed at the sad picture. The next sound pair
would be presented  ms later, after the experimenter pressed the space
bar, and children were free to have a rest whenever they wanted. No
feedback was given to the participants during the practice and test blocks.
For the adult participants, the training session was excluded, and the materials
in the practice and test blocks were exactly the same as for the child participants.
The identiﬁcation and discrimination tasks were conducted within one day.
During the identiﬁcation task, the adult participants were asked to press key
‘’ on the keyboard when they heard a ‘Tone ’ sound and to press key ‘’
when they heard a ‘Tone ’ sound. In the discrimination task, they were
instructed to judge whether the two stimuli were the same or diﬀerent, and to
respond by pressing a key (‘v’ for ‘same’, and ‘n’ for ‘diﬀerent’).

Data analyses
To investigate the developmental
the identiﬁcation and
discrimination performance, three key parameters of CP were calculated:
position of category boundary, width of category boundary, and discrimination
accuracy.

trajectory of

For each stimulus, the identiﬁcation score was computed as the average
percentage of level (Tone ) or rising tone (Tone ) responses. Boundary
position and boundary width were assessed using Probit analyses (Finney,
). The boundary position (deﬁned as the % cross-over point) and
the boundary width (deﬁned as the linear distance between the th and
th percentiles) were analyzed according to the procedures described in
Peng et al. ().

To calculate the discrimination scores, we divided the  discrimination
trials into nine comparison units, each consisting of all pairs in four types of
pairwise comparisons (AB, BA, AA, and BB) (cf. Xu et al., ). Adjacent
comparison units contained the overlapping AA or BB pairs (e.g. the ﬁve –
pairs were included in both – and – units). The discrimination accuracy

where the percentages of ‘same’ (‘S’) and ‘diﬀerent’ (‘D’) responses to all the

by P (‘S’/S) and P (‘D’/D), respectively. P(S) and P(D) were the
probabilities of S (AA or BB) and D (AB or BA) trials in each unit, which
were both equal to · (Peng et al., ).

In addition, we calculated the discrimination accuracy of between-category
comparisons (Pbc) and within-category comparisons (Pwc) for each subject
based on the position of category boundary as follows (cf. Jiang, Hamm,
Lim, Kirk & Yang, ). If the identiﬁcation results indicated that one
participant’s categorical boundary was at position ·, then the average
discrimination scores corresponding to the comparison units – and –
which straddled the boundary would be coded as the discrimination
accuracy for between-category comparisons, while the within-category
discrimination accuracy for that subject was obtained from the mean of the
discrimination scores for the remaining seven comparison units.

Identiﬁcation and discrimination curves
Identiﬁcation and discrimination curves among diﬀerent age groups are
shown in Figure . Similar to adult Mandarin listeners, categorical
boundaries and corresponding discrimination peaks were found for all
child participants, indicating a typical CP of Mandarin Tone  and Tone .

Position and width of categorical boundary
The estimated boundary position and boundary width values are shown in
Table . In addition, the distribution of boundary width among diﬀerent
groups is shown in Figure .

The mean boundary positions for the groups are as follows: four yr: ·, ﬁve
yr: ·, six yr (K): ·, six yr (P): ·, seven yr: ·, adults: ·. Results of
one-way ANOVA revealed that the perceptual boundary positions were not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent among diﬀerent age groups [F(,) = ·; p = ·].
The average boundary widths for the groups are as follows: four yr: ·, ﬁve
yr: ·, six yr (K): ·, six yr (P): ·, seven yr: ·, and adults: ·.
Three outliers (shown in Figure ) were removed from the statistical
analyses, with one in six yr (P) and two in seven yr. One-way ANOVA
showed that the identiﬁcation widths among diﬀerent age groups were
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent [F(,) = ·; p < ·]. Tukey’s HSD post-hoc
pairwise comparisons of the six groups indicated that the groups of six yr
(K), six yr (P), seven yr, and adults had signiﬁcantly narrower boundary
widths than the four-year-old group (all ps < ·) and ﬁve-year-old group
(all ps < ·). However,
the boundary widths between the four- and
ﬁve-year-old groups were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (p = ·), and the
boundary widths between any two groups of six yr (K), six yr (P), seven yr,
and adults were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent either (all ps > ·).

To investigate the correlation between boundary widths and chronological
ages, we conducted a Pearson correlation analysis and found a negative
correlation between boundary widths and chronological ages (r = –·,

However, for the within-category discrimination accuracy (Pwc), there was
no signiﬁcant correlation between within-category discrimination accuracies
and ages (r = ·, p = ·).

In conclusion, from the identiﬁcation curves and the distribution of boundary
widths, we could see clearly that changes from high-level to mid-rising tone were
more abrupt from six-year-olds. For the tone discrimination, the sensitivity to
between-category discrimination showed a rising trend as children get older.
However, the within-category discrimination accuracies did not change
signiﬁcantly among all the child participants. Moreover, children as early as
four years of age, with plenty of exposure to Mandarin as their mother
tongue, could perceive Mandarin Tone  and Tone  categorically.

D I S C U S S I O N
The current study examined CP of Mandarin Tone  and Tone  in typically
developing four- to seven-year-old children. As deﬁned by Liberman et al.
(), typical CP should be signaled by a sharp boundary between two
categories
corresponding discrimination peak straddling the
identiﬁcation boundary. In this study, prominent discrimination peaks
were well aligned with the corresponding identiﬁcation cross-overs for all
child participants, indicating that tone perception was highly categorical

their perceptual ability to process lexical tones as diﬀerent categories, even

without knowing the metalinguistic concept of tones at all. In stark contrast,
six- to eight-year-old English monolingual children who have not yet been
exposed to a tone language showed no categorical boundaries or
discrimination peaks for the continuum between Mandarin Tone  and
Tone  (Yang & Liu, ). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that
tone language exposure is critical for learning to perceive lexical tones
categorically.

Tone contrasts of diﬀerent categories may emerge very early in perception,
but the process actually takes a relatively long time to fully mature. The
development of CP of Mandarin Tone  and Tone  in young children
with respect to both identiﬁcation and discrimination performance was
observed in the current study. In the present identiﬁcation test, diﬀerent
age groups did not
show signiﬁcantly diﬀerent boundary positions
(ranging from · to ·; see Table ). Similarly, adults with tone or
non-tone language experiences yielded similar identiﬁcation boundaries
near the middle of the tone continuum (e.g. Peng et al., ; Xu et al.,
). These ﬁndings seem to decrease the eﬃcacy of boundary position in
assessing the degree of CP. However, the boundary width was much
narrower (i.e. a sharper boundary or steeper transition slope) for tone
language listeners than for non-tone language listeners (Hallé et al., ;
Peng et al., ; Wang, ; Xu et al., ). Likewise, the current
experimental data showed that child groups of six yr, seven yr, and the
adult group exhibited much narrower boundary widths than those of the
four- and ﬁve-year-old groups (see Table  and Figure ), indicating that
six-year-olds have already acquired adult-like identiﬁcation competence of

ambiguous stimuli, as reﬂected by a sharper boundary. Our conclusion is a
supplement to another identiﬁcation study by Xi et al. (), in which a
signiﬁcant enhancement
the tone continuum
between Tone  and Tone  was found for six-year-olds in ﬁrst grade who
had already received tone instruction. What we would like to emphasize
here is that none of the four- to six-year-old preschoolers in our study had
received explicit education concerning the concept of Mandarin tones,
and, in the identiﬁcation task, they were simply asked to judge the sound
stimulus like a level sound or a rising one. Consequently, it is reasonable
to conclude that the adult-like identiﬁcation competence of Mandarin
Tone  and Tone  appears around age six, regardless of explicit
education in tone categories.

that

In addition to the identiﬁcation improvement at age six, there was also a
performance increment with age for the Mandarin-speaking children’s
between-category discriminability, but not
the within-category
discriminability. These ﬁndings are consistent with the dual-process model
(Fujisaki & Kawashima, ), which proposes two separate pathways for
the discrimination of speech stimuli. Fujisaki and Kawashima assume ﬁrst
and foremost
identiﬁcation is inevitable, even in discrimination
experiments where identiﬁcation is not a part of the subject’s task. In this
model, two separate pathways in the discrimination task are involved in
the decision mechanism. One pathway is used when the two stimuli of the
comparison pair receive diﬀerent phoneme labels. The labeling process
along this ﬁrst pathway is based on the information of phoneme
boundaries stored in long-term memory (i.e. phonetic memory code). If
the two stimuli that have to be discriminated instead receive the same
label, then, and only then, the other pathway is used, and the information
about the spectral composition of the two stimuli (based on short-term
auditory memory code) leads to the ﬁnal decision. Both auditory and
phonetic modes co-exist during the discrimination task, but subjects
operate exclusively in long-term phonetic mode during the identiﬁcation
task. Consequently, according to this model, both the identiﬁcation and
between-category discrimination abilities undergo a developmental pattern
when children are exposed to a tonal environment consistently, and
further store the tone category information in their long-term phonetic
memory.

On the other hand, from the perspective of Fujisaki and Kawashima’s
() model, if children identify the two-tone stimuli as being in the
same category, the second pathway then kicks in. Children would make
their decision on the basis of the physical F diﬀerence between the two
stimuli, which is based on short-term auditory memory code. Our results

revealed no signiﬁcant improvement in the performance of within-category
discrimination in four- to seven-year-old children, with each stimulus pair
separated by  Hz at the onset F. As suggested in a recent study (Liu,
) exploring the just noticeable diﬀerence (JND) of the F contour,
Mandarin adult listeners required nearly  Hz to detect a tonal pitch
change. Given that young children generally require greater JND in F
discrimination than adult listeners (Elliot, Hammer, School & Wasowicz,
; Jensen & Neﬀ, ), children may require a F diﬀerence of more
than the  Hz used in the current study, even at age seven, to perform
the within-category discrimination task more reliably.

signal-detection model

in experimental context

the diﬀerent variants of

In addition to the dual-process model, there is another approach called the
‘signal-detection model’ (Durlach & Braida, ), with two modes of
memory operation included: a trace mode and a context-coding mode.
Applying this
to CP successfully explains the
discrepancy between ﬁxed/roving discrimination and identiﬁcation sensitivity
regarding diﬀerences
(Macmillan, Kaplan &
Creelman, ). However, the primary drawbacks of the signal-detection
model lie in that it does not diﬀerentiate short-term and long-term memory
components in the context-coding mode (Macmillan, Goldberg & Braida,
), and this model only considers
the
experimental context. Consequently, the signal-detection model could not
explain any experience-driven eﬀects on CP. For
example, many
cross-language CP studies (Hallé et al., ; Peng et al., ; Wang, ;
Xu et al., ) indicated that tonal language listeners demonstrated a much
sharper identiﬁcation boundary and a more prominent discrimination peak
around the boundary than non-tonal
language listeners. Cross-language
diﬀerences can only be explained with regard to diﬀerences in the two
groups’
long-term experience with their respective native languages, and
not due to diﬀerences in experimental context (that was identical for the
tonal language and non-tonal language listeners). Similarly, in the present
study, age-related enhancement of both identiﬁcation and between-category
discrimination ability in children can be attributed to long-term accumulation
of tone language experience, and not to the diﬀerences in the experimental
context that was identical for all the child participants. Therefore, the results
of the present study ﬁt in with previous cross-language research and provide

Using the classic paradigm of CP, the current study sought to explore the

positions of
the identiﬁcation boundaries did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly
between children and adults, but the boundary widths between Tone 
and Tone  did diﬀer signiﬁcantly, with much narrower boundary widths
(i.e. sharper boundaries) occurring in six-year-olds than ﬁve-year-olds.
Moreover, with age, the ability to discriminate more ﬁne-grained tonal
diﬀerences of between-category pairs was enhanced gradually due to
perceptual accumulation. These ﬁndings contribute to the work in
discovering the general developmental course of CP during the maturation
and stabilization of tone perception in young children.
