Introduction.
Children’s first word forms have been found to be very similar across
languages, with minor ambient language effects (Boysson-Bardies &
Vihman, ; Vihman, Kay, Boysson-Bardies, Durand & Sundberg,
). This similarity in production can be ascribed to infants’ limited
articulatory skills (Davis & MacNeilage, ) and experience (Vihman,
). As children move into regular word production, however,
cross-linguistic differences are observed (Stoel-Gammon, Williams &
Buder, ; Buder & Stoel-Gammon, ; Vihman, , ). One
early-emerging difference, for example, is the production of long
consonants or, where consonantal length plays a phonologically contrastive
role, GEMINATES (which nevertheless need not be in any sense contrastive
for the children).
Because child production is relatively slow or sluggish (Smith, ;
Payne, Post, Astruc, Prieto & Vanrell, ), long medial consonants can
readily be heard (and measured) in the first words, even in the case of
children exposed only to languages like English or French, where they are
not contrastive and in fact rarely occur at all (Vihman & Velleman, ).
To illustrate this, analysis of the word forms produced by five children
each at the time of first word use (termed the -WORD POINT [wp]: the
first -minute recording session in which at least four different
spontaneously produced words can be identified; mean age ;· for the
American and French infants, ; for the Finnish infants) revealed a mean
consonant length for English of  ms (s.d. ·), for French,  ms
(s.d. ·), and for Finnish, with its contrastive consonant length,  ms
(s.d. ) (Vihman & Velleman, ).
As the children gain production skills and productive lexical knowledge of
their language, however, the duration of medial consonants drops
significantly in languages with no phonological contrast in consonant
length. Thus, at the end of the single-word period (-WORD POINT
[wp]; mean age ; for the American infants, ; for the French, ; for
the Finnish), the mean medial-consonant duration for the same five
children learning English was  ms and for those learning French,
 ms, with a drop in variability within each group as well (s.d. for
English, ·, for French, ·); at the same time, medial consonants
became longer and intra-group variability increased for the five Finnish
children (mean  ms, s.d. ·).
In fact, in languages with geminates the use and overuse of these long
consonants (i.e. their production even for singleton targets) is consistently
reported for the single-word period (see, for Arabic: Khattab &
Al-Tamimi, ; for Estonian: Vihman, ; for Finnish: Kunnari,
; Savinainen-Makkonen, a, b, , ; for Hindi: Bhaya
Nair, ; for Italian: Keren-Portnoy, Majorano & Vihman, ;
Majorano, Rainieri & Corsano ; and for Japanese: Kunnari, Nakai &
Vihman, ; Ota, ). Finally, children learning Welsh, with its
(phonetic) accentual lengthening of consonants, also make heavy use of
long medial consonants in their early words (Vihman, Nakai & DePaolis,
), although no significant increase in mean medial consonant duration
is seen in this case over the period of single word use (Vihman & Kunnari,
), presumably because long consonants are not lexically contrastive in
Welsh. That is, where consonant duration is a (non-contrastive)
concomitant of the accentual pattern, its frequency of occurrence may be
variable but should be consistently so over time and development. Where
it is lexically tied, infants’ increasing lexical knowledge results in a steady
increase in representations of words with geminates. Thus, contrastive
child use, as seen in Finnish, appears to be mediated by lexical advance.
Examples of early words produced with long medial consonants in Arabic,
Estonian, Finnish, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, and Welsh are presented in
Table , where SELECTED (or more or less accurately produced words) have
a long consonant in the adult target as well as in the child form, whereas
ADAPTED words (modified to fit one of the child’s favored production
patterns) display ‘overuse’ of geminates. Here we observe that in their
production of long consonants children may replace a VV sequence by CC
(see both Martin’s word form for Arabic ba:ba and Kaia’s form for
Estonian auto), omit the onset consonant (as in Joel’s word for Finnish
loppu; cf. also the Hindi and Japanese examples), ‘demote’ an onset
consonant (replacing a supraglottal by a glottal segment: Fflur, Welsh
example), or retain the length feature while changing the segmental quality
(and word length) to fit a consonant-harmony constraint (as in Anna’s
word for Italian cavallo).
Interestingly, in most of these languages child overuse of the prosodic
word shape <VCCV> can be observed (as in the examples from Joel, V,
Haruo, and Fflur; Table ), even when the adult target form includes an
early-learned onset consonant such as a labial or coronal stop and the word
is accentually trochaic (strong–weak accent), so that the omitted initial
consonant is part of the accented syllable. In fact, Vihman and Velleman
() report that % of the tokens produced by five Finnish children at
the wp were of the shape <VCCV>. Savinainen-Makkonen (),
similarly, reports use of <VC(C)V> as an idiosyncratic child pattern or
TEMPLATE in both selected and adapted words in her case study of the
Finnish child Joel: anna ‘give’ [ɑn:ɑ], vettä ‘water’ [et:æ], tippu ‘fell’ [ip:o],
lusikas ‘spoon’ [uki], nammi ‘candy/yummy’ [ɑmi], [mɑmi], [mɑm:i],
nostaa ‘carry’ [ot:ɑ:] (cf. also Savinainen-Makkonen, b).
The frequent occurrence of the <VC(C)V> pattern in Finnish child forms
is all the more striking since the corresponding pattern – VCV, with omitted
onset consonant – is rare in the early word forms of children learning
(primarily trochaic) English (Savinainen-Makkonen, b; Vihman &
Croft, ), although not in those of children learning final-syllableaccented
French (Wauquier & Yamaguchi, ) or primarily iambic
(weak–strong) Hebrew (Keren-Portnoy & Segal, in press). This suggests
that, in addition to the ease of articulation of geminates (due to the slow
rate of early speech production), their greater segmental duration may
make them particularly salient to children, which in turn might draw
attention away from the onset consonant, as suggested by Savinainen-
Makkonen (b).
This would be in accord with the WHOLE-WORD PHONOLOGY account, which
argues that children’s early words reflect child memory for the word as a
whole, with production of certain salient elements, such as the accented
syllable, at the expense of other aspects (Vihman, Nakai, DePaolis &
Hallé, ; Vihman & Croft, ). The whole-word phonology model
(Vihman & Keren-Portnoy, a) provides a usage- and exemplar-based
perspective on phonological development that contrasts with linear,
stage-like approaches that depend on Universal Grammar and parameter
setting or markedness-constraint ranking to account for knowledge of
linguistic structure (e.g. Kager, Pater & Zonneveld, ; Demuth,
Culbertson & Alter, ). According to the whole-word phonology
model, initial item learning, which targets ‘easy’ words and involves
relatively accurate production, is followed by implicit ‘secondary’
distributional learning of the patterns inherent in the child’s own first
word forms (see Vihman, , Ch. ). In other words, once the child has
produced a small collection of different words, she begins to implicitly
pick up on the patterns inherent in those words, which reflect both the
ambient language structures and the child’s own starting point, commonly
rooted in babbling experience (e.g. Vihman, Macken, Miller, Simmons &
Miller, ).
Implicit learning of patterns that become salient through a child’s own
production experience typically leads to a regression in accuracy (and so to
a non-linear developmental path). Regression in accuracy is the result of
the child generalizing the structural patterns inherent in the word forms
they are using. The resultant patterns appear to constitute (unconscious or
implicit) child responses to the phonological challenges posed by target
word forms. In other words, the child’s existing resources (familiar
production routines) are deployed to deal with what is novel and thus
difficult to bring to mind, plan, and produce as needed (Vihman &
Keren-Portnoy, b, p. ). At the same time, when children learn
languages like Arabic or Finnish, which contrast long and short (geminate
and singleton) consonants, expressive lexical advance must play a key role
in the acquisition of the structural contrast in medial consonant duration.
In this study we test Savinainen-Makkonen’s hypothesis regarding the
salience of geminates and the effect of that salience on the shape of early
word forms by analyzing data from the acquisition of Italian, through
both observational production and experimental perception studies. We
focus on three research questions:
. Will the frequency of occurrence of geminates in words used in
child-directed speech be mirrored or accentuated in child selection of
words to attempt or in their early word forms?
. Do Italian children tend to omit word-initial consonants particularly in
words with medial geminates?
. Will perception experiments provide corroborating evidence of an effect
of medial geminates on children’s attention to the word-initial
consonant? If so, this may be interpreted as evidence in favor of
whole-word phonology, inasmuch as a segmental feature occurring later
in the word is seen to affect infant processing of the beginning of the
word.
We begin by considering the effect of geminates on child production in a
study of thirty children seen with their parents for two recording sessions,
at ; and ; (Study ). We then test the last research question directly in
three experiments involving untrained word-form recognition in
-month-olds (Study ).

STUDY : GEMINATES IN ITALIAN CHILDREN’S
WORD PRODUCTION
To gain an idea of the role of geminates in Italian children’s early word
production we analyzed the words produced in two recording sessions by
thirty children aged ; at the first session, ; at the second. We also
considered the proportion of geminates in the words attempted by these
children (target words) and in the child-directed speech of their mothers in
the same two sessions. Finally, we examined the differential application of a
<VC(C)V> template in the child word forms to targets with medial
singletons vs. geminates.
METHOD
Participants
Thirty-six families were recruited through a letter given to parents of
children attending municipal nurseries. Six children were later excluded
because of missing data or because they failed to produce any words. In
the final sample of thirty infants ( males), nineteen (%) were
first-born, nine had one sibling, two had two. All came from monolingual
Italian families; none had health issues or developmental disabilities. The
mothers’ mean age was  years, the fathers’, . Sixteen mothers and
fourteen fathers held university degrees. Parents gave informed consent for
their children to participate in the study.
At the first observation the children were aged ;·, on average (range
;·–;·), and at the second, ;· (range ;·–;·). Note that
this was a longitudinal study, but with just two sessions, based on child
age; it cannot usefully be compared with age-ranges at wp and wp in
the English, French, and Finnish children mentioned earlier. (For the
range of word types produced by the Italian children in the transcribed
recordings of the -minute sessions, see Table b.)
Procedure
Each infant was observed for  minutes in each of two sessions at the
observation laboratory, Department of Psychology, University of Parma;
both parents were present in all cases. The ALB protocol (Assessing
Linguistic Behaviour: Olswang, Stoel-Gammon, Coggins & Carpenter,
) was followed. In each session four different sets of toys were
presented, one at a time and in a set order, to elicit as large a sample as
possible of words used spontaneously: farm set, ‘nurturing’ set (doll with
bed and telephone), ‘food’ set (plastic fruit and vegetables, dishes, and
cutlery), and cars and tractors. The parents were instructed to play with
the children as at home but to try to maintain the children’s attention on
the toys.
Transcription, words analyzed and reliability. The sessions were recorded
on video in a lab with four cameras (split video) and one microphone in
the environment and another on the child. The experimenter broadly
transcribed each child’s vocal and verbal production, noting contextual
elements (e.g. child interaction with objects, communicative gestures and
gaze direction, and parental verbal production immediately preceding and
following that of the children). Each completed session was transcribed using
CHAT (Codes for the Human Analysis of Transcripts; MacWhinney, ).
Note that in the analyses that follow we report only CONTENT WORD types
(and tokens) for the children as well as the mothers: Italian function words
(e.g. articles, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions) include few if any
geminates and are still relatively rare in the children’s production at the
ages we observed. Onomatopoeia, which rarely, if ever, includes geminates
in Italian and whose adult form is often variable were excluded from all of
our analyses.
Point-to-point agreement between the two transcribers on segmental
identity, based on about % of each transcript, was ·. Agreement on
length of medial consonants in the child forms, based on % of the child
forms, was · at ;, · at ;.
Coding. Words were identified following the procedures outlined in
Vihman and McCune (), with only SPONTANEOUSLY PRODUCED WORDS
included. For the analysis into templates we identified repeatedly used
prosodic structures, following Vihman (), focusing particularly on
child ‘overuse’ or generalization of structures and distinguishing between
selected and adapted words (Vihman & Velleman, ). A word is
considered to be selected, or relatively accurate, if it is produced correctly
within the limits of the child’s phonetic inventory (e.g. it counts as
accurate in spite of consonant cluster or coda reduction or omission of /r/
or /s/, for example, if the child is not yet producing those sounds or
structures); a word is considered to be adapted if it is modified with
respect to the target, especially its prosodic structure.
Child-directed speech (CDS). In order to obtain an estimate of geminate
use in Italian input speech we analyzed the content words produced by the
mothers of the thirty children in each recorded session.
RESULTS
Table a shows the range, mean, and standard deviation of content words
(both types and tokens) that the thirty mothers addressed to their children
in each recording session. In addition, it shows the number and
proportion of content words with geminates (in both types and tokens).
Here we see that, in terms of either types or tokens, about one-third of the
words the mothers produced in both sessions had geminates (see numbers
in bold face). In all of the analyses the mothers are also quite similar to
one another in their use of geminates, as is evident from the low standard
deviation on proportion of geminates (also in bold).
Table b provides the range, mean, and standard deviation of content
words the children attempted overall (or of TYPES produced, which is the
same thing) at ; and ;, while Table c provides the same information
in relation to the tokens produced at each session. In addition, Table b
shows the range, mean, and standard deviation of the target words
attempted that had geminates at each age and the PROPORTION of target
words attempted that had geminates; it also shows the range, mean, and
standard deviation of word types PRODUCED with geminates at each age and
the PROPORTION of types produced with geminates, while Table c gives
the same information in relation to tokens.
In these tables we see that at ;, when most of the children are just
beginning to produce words, the proportion of geminates is highly
variable (shows a high standard deviation: in bold face) as regards both
target words attempted (·) and actual child forms produced (in terms of
either types –· – or tokens –·) as compared with both CDS (· and
·, respectively, at the earlier session) and child words attempted (·)
and produced (in either types –· – or tokens –·) at ;. The overall
figures for the children’s production (about half include geminates, at both
ages and in terms of either types or tokens) correspond closely with
findings based on the Italian Communicative Development Inventory
(CDI: Caselli & Casadio, ; Rinaldi, Barca & Burani, ), in which
 of the  words most widely reported at ; have medial geminates.
The key point to be gleaned from these tables is that geminate words
attract disproportionate child attention and production: the children
attempt and produce a higher proportion of words with geminates than
the mothers present them with in their CDS. To test the significance
of these differences we conducted a repeated-measures  ×  ANOVA
(dependent variable: proportion of geminates in TYPES; within-subject
factors: age, with two levels, ; and ;, and words, with three levels,
proportion of word types containing geminates in CDS, proportion of
targets, and proportion of child forms). The analysis showed no main
effect for age (F[,] = ·; p = ·, η = ·), a significant effect for words
(F[,] = ·; p < ·, η = ·), and an interaction of age × words
(F[,] = ·; p = ·, η = ·). Post-hoc analyses indicated that at both
; (p < ·) and ; (p < ·) both the targets and the word forms
children produced had (proportionately) significantly more geminates than
were used in CDS word types. Furthermore, at ; the child forms
included a higher proportion of geminates than did the targets (p < ·).
We also conducted a repeated-measures  ×  ANOVA with proportion of
geminates in TOKENS instead of types as our dependent variable and with two
within-subject factors, each of them with two levels (age: ; and ;, and
words: proportion of word tokens containing geminates in CDS and in
child forms). There was no effect for age (F[,] = ·, p = ·, η = ·)
and no interaction (F[,] = ·, p = ·, η = ·). However, there was a
highly significant effect for words (F[,] = ·, p < ·, η = ·).
Post-hoc analysis indicates that at both ages the child tokens included a
significantly higher proportion of geminates than are seen in CDS word
tokens (p < ·).
To test whether there is an effect of individual mothers’ CDS on their
children’s production of geminates we examined the results by dyad, as
regards words attempted (targets), word types, and word tokens produced
by the children in relation to both types and tokens produced by the
mothers. We found no significant correlations when raw numbers were
compared; in proportions, a single correlation was significant, between the
proportion of child word tokens and CDS word tokens at ; (r() = ·;
p < ·). However, the results may not be reliable, given the relatively
narrow range of variability in the CDS tokens, the ephemeral nature of the
correlation (which disappears by ;), and the multiple correlations run in
order to detect any possible relationship between child and adult use of
words with geminates.
More generally, we see that the children both overselect and overproduce
geminate words, in both types and tokens, compared to the usage we observe
in CDS. These results suggest that the salience of geminates for Italian
children is quite similar to what is observed in Finnish, where geminates
occurred in about % of content words in input speech but made up %
of words attempted by the five children observed in the single-word
period and % of the word forms produced by the children in that period
(Kunnari, ; Vihman & Velleman, ). Thus Italian children, like
the smaller sample of Finnish children observed in earlier studies, both
overselect and overproduce words with geminates, especially at ;, when
their vocabularies are considerably larger.
A <VC(C)V> pattern or template is commonly seen in Italian children. At
;,  of the  children had one or more word types adapted to fit the
pattern; the mean proportion of such adapted word types per child was
·. At ;,  of the  children adapted words to this template, with a
mean proportion of ·. Table  illustrates use of the template. It includes
all the trochaic disyllables adapted by omission of the initial consonant by
the three highest-producing children at ; and the five highest-producing
children at ;. Note that trochaic disyllables constitute the largest
proportion of words attempted at both ages – % at ;, % at ;;
monosyllables and iambs each make up fewer than % at both ages, while
longer words are attempted in % of the words produced at ;, % at
;. These longer words are mainly trisyllabic at ; but range up to five
syllables at ; (e.g. animaletti /animaˈlet:i/ ‘little animals’, produced by
two children – as [let:i, amaˈlet:i] and [maˈlet:i]), aspettatemi /aspeˈt:atemi/
‘wait (pl.) for me’ [peˈt:atemi]).
As shown in Table , at ;, the children targeted  trochaic disyllabic
word types altogether, with or without onset consonants (last column,
Table a); they produced  (%) of these as <VC(C)V> (first column,
Table a). Over half of the trochaic target words have medial geminates, but
of the three types of medial consonant-slot filler (singleton, heterogeneous
cluster, or geminate), the largest proportion PRODUCED WITHOUT AN ONSET
CONSONANT in this session (second column, Table a) were those with
heterogeneous clusters (%). It is worth noting, however, that the 
target words with heterogeneous clusters produced WITH an onset
consonant here were variably realized in the child form (based on types,
not tokens) with medial singletons (), clusters (nasal + stop only: ) or
geminates (). Of the  words with heterogeneous clusters produced
WITHOUT an onset (first column, Table a, CC word types), two of the
child forms had a nasal + stop cluster, eight (%) had a long medial
consonant.
At ;, of the  trochaic disyllables targeted with onset consonants (last
column, Table b),  (%) were produced as <VC(C)V> (first two
columns, Table b). At this point a greater proportion of word types with
medial geminates in the adult target form (, or %) were adapted to the
template in comparison with word types with singletons (, or %); the
difference is significant by paired two-tailed t-test (t() = ·, p < ).
Word types with heterogeneous clusters (, or %) are again the most
often adapted to the template, but  of them (%) are PRODUCED with long
consonants. However, % of the heterogeneous clusters in word types that
RETAIN their onset in the child form are also realized as long consonants in
this session. Thus at both ages long medial consonants predominate in
child forms adapted to the template by onset-consonant omission; we
cannot determine from these data whether some or all of the children
perceived medial heterogeneous consonants as geminates.
An additional factor in initial consonant omission is the relatively large
number of Italian target words that exceed the typical two-syllable
length limit on early word production. At ;,  of the  word types
adapted by initial-consonant omission (by  of the  children who so
adapted words) were trisyllabic,  with onset omission only (from the first
syllable: caduto /kaˈduto/ ‘has fallen’ [oˈduto], giraffa /dʒiˈraf:a/ ‘giraffe’
[eˈjap:a], macchina /maˈk:ina/ [ˈakja]),  with full initial syllable omission,
leaving a disyllabic onsetless form (camicia /kaˈmitʃa/ ‘shirt’ [ˈiʧa], forchetta
/forˈket:a/ ‘fork’ [ˈet:a]). At ;,  of the  children who adapted words
by initial-consonant omission included three- or four-syllable words in
this pattern; of  target words of more than two syllables the children
omitted only the initial consonant in , maintaining the vowel of the first
syllable (e.g. cavallo /kaˈval:o/ ‘horse’ [aˈval:o], vicino /viˈtʃino/ ‘near-by’
[iˈtʃino], zucchero /ˈtsuk:ero/ ‘sugar’ [ˈuk:elo]); in all but one of the
remaining  words one or more of the pre-stress syllables were truncated,
along with the onset to the first syllable included in the child form
(bambolotto /bamboˈlɔt:o/ ‘dolly’ [oˈtot:o], pecorella /pekoˈrεl:a/ ‘lamb’
[oˈlεl:a], [εl:a]); the exception is aggiustala /aˈd:ʒustala/ [ˈaʤ:i] ‘fix it’, in
which it is the post-stress syllables that are omitted. Note that this is the only
four-syllable word attempted with stress on the antepenult, a stress pattern
typical of trisyllabic verbs in the imperative with an affixed pronominal
clitic (here, /la/). In  of these  words the child produced a long consonant.
DISCUSSION.
We considered the words produced spontaneously by thirty Italian children
in naturalistic play with their parents at two sampling points, at ages ; and
;.We found that geminates, which occurred in about a third of the content
words used by the mothers in speech directed to their children in the two
sessions, were produced significantly more frequently by the children; in
addition, at ; a significantly greater proportion of words were produced
with long consonants than were attempted, primarily due to long
consonant production of heterogeneous clusters. Thus in Italian, as in
Finnish, geminates are relatively frequent in input speech but are even
more frequently selected by the children and are also preferentially
produced. Furthermore, analysis of the children’s use of a <VC(C)V>
template showed that, again as in Finnish, word-initial consonants are
frequently omitted even when that syllable is accented. And, finally,
geminates as well as heterogeneous clusters predominate in the trochaic
disyllables adapted to the template by omission of the initial consonant in
the child form; the majority of words with either cluster type are produced
with long consonants and may be so perceived. The same observation
applies to words of three or more syllables adapted by omission of either
the onset consonant alone or of one or more syllables as well as of the
onset of the stressed syllable.
In short, the hypothesis suggested by Finnish data arises from the Italian
data as well: the presence of medial geminates (like final-syllable lengthening
in French or iambic accentual pattern in Hebrew) appears to pull attention
away from the word-initial consonant, even when that consonant is part of
the accented syllable. Study  was carried out to test that hypothesis.
STUDY : UNTRAINED WORD-FORM RECOGNITION
This study was undertaken to test the proposal that the presence of medial
geminates leads to perceptual neglect of the onset consonant; this in turn
is based on the hypothesis that omission of the onset consonant of adapted
disyllables and longer words results, at least in part, from representational
neglect. We draw here on the untrained word-form recognition paradigm
introduced by Hallé and Boysson-Bardies () and since replicated with
British English (Vihman et al., ), Dutch (Swingley, ), and
American English (Seal, DePaolis, Baird, Kulsar, Keren-Portnoy &
Vihman, ). In each of these studies -month-old infants were found to
recognize words likely to be familiar from the home (although younger
infants did not: Vihman et al., ; Vihman, Thierry, Lum, Keren-
Portnoy & Martin, ). In follow-up experiments French -month-olds
were found to recognize words even when the word-initial consonant was
changed (Hallé & Boysson-Bardies, ) (although not when it was
omitted), but they were less likely to do so when it was the medial
consonant (the onset to the accented syllable in French disyllables) that was
changed. In English the reverse effect was found: initial consonant change
blocked word-form recognition but medial consonant change did not
(Vihman et al., ). Furthermore the consonant-change effect was
stronger in English than in French, presumably because the English
accented syllable is also word-initial and so processed first.
Following Vihman et al. (), the preferential headturn procedure was
used here in three experiments designed to test words expected to be
familiar to the infants from frequent exposure in everyday life, with no
specific training in the lab; these words were contrasted with ‘rare’ words,
or words to which infants are unlikely to have been previously exposed.
We reasoned that if it is the presence of medial geminates that leads to
child reliance on <VCCV> templates in production, then changes to the
onset consonant of words with geminates should not block word-form
recognition in Italian -month-olds.
EXPERIMENT 
The first experiment was designed to establish word-form recognition in
Italian infants as a baseline.
METHOD
Participants
The participants were recruited through the nurseries of Comune di Parma.
Each family received a letter and signed a consent form. Fifteen mothers and
ten fathers had a university degree. The children were tested at the
Observational Laboratory of the University of Parma. Twenty infants were
tested ( females; mean age ;·, range, ;·–;·). Three
children were excluded, two due to crying, one due to a technical
problem. None of these infants had participated in Study .
Stimuli
In each list, FAMILIAR and RARE, six words with singletons and six with
geminates were chosen to serve as stimuli (see ‘Appendix’: first six words
in ‘Unchanged, medial geminate’ and ‘Unchanged, medial singleton’
columns; available at http://dx.doi.org/./S). The
familiar words were chosen from those most often identified on the Italian
CDI as occurring in children’s words within the first few months of word
use; the rare words were chosen to provide a good phonotactic match to
the familiar list, but as non-occurring in the Italian CDI (Caselli &
Casadio, ). All six familiar words with medial geminates and three
with medial singletons had been produced in the recorded sessions by one
or more of the children whose data are reported in Study . The
frequency of the words was checked against the database or ‘basic lexicon’
(, words) of Marconi, Ott, Pesenti, Ratti, and Tavella (). The
familiar words from our study that were included in this database (all of
our familiar-word stimuli except tata) had a mean frequency of ·; the
four rare words from our study that were included in the database (flotta,
picco, leva, busto) had a mean frequency of ·.
Six variant lists of the twelve stimuli were recorded by a female native
Italian speaker in a sound-treated room using a RODE NTA condenser
microphone connected to a Metrichalo soundcard sampling at  KHz-
bits. The stimuli had an amplitude peak within ± · dB (using an
integration time of  ms) of  dB and an inter-stimulus interval of 
ms. The average duration of each word was · s (s.d. = ·).
Procedure
The experiment was conducted in accord with Kemler Nelson, Jusczyk,
Mandel, Myers, Turk, and Gerken (). Infants were seated on their
mother’s lap in a three-sided test booth. A camera and red light were
placed on the center panel and a blue light and speaker were mounted on
the two side panels. The experimenter controlled presentation of the
stimuli from a separate room, using a video monitor and PC.
The experiment included a familiarization phase, designed to acquaint the
infants with the procedure, and a test phase. During the familiarization phase
the two lists were presented once in full for each experiment. During the test
phase twelve lists were presented, each made up of the six words of each type,
familiar and rare, in pseudo-randomized order (alternating the top word or
two in each trial, to ensure infant exposure to all words), for twelve trials.
Each trial started as soon as the flashing central light had captured the
infant’s gaze. At that point, one of the blue lights (chosen randomly by the
program) would begin to flash and, once the infant’s head (i.e. gaze) had
turned toward the light, one of the randomly selected lists would begin to
play after a · s delay. The experimenter recorded the infant’s looking time
in response to the list (not to individual words) by pressing a button on
the computer as soon as the infant turned his or her head at least ° towards
the side light. Each trial ended when the infant turned away for more than  s.
To assess reliability, a second experimenter coded twelve infants’ looking
time off-line; inter-judge agreement was · (Cohen’s index).
RESULTS
In this baseline experiment the mean looking time in response to the
familiar-word lists was · s, to rare-word lists, ·s (t() = ·,
p < ·, d = ·: see Figure ). Seventeen of the  infants looked longer,
on average, in response to familiar than to rare words. A split-half analysis
revealed a steady decline in interest in both sets of stimuli over the course
of the experiment, from a mean of · s (s.d. ·) for familiar, · s
(s.d. ·) for rare in the first half to · s (s.d. ·) for familiar, · s
(s.d. ·) for rare in the second half. This accords with the baseline
results reported in Vihman et al. (). Thus at ; Italian children, like
American, British, French, and Dutch children, respond with greater
attention to untrained familiar words, or words heard frequently as part of
everyday routines in the home, than to words that they are unlikely ever to
have heard outside of the experimental context. Interest in both sets of
stimuli declines at roughly the same rate over the course of the experiment.
Experiments  and  were designed to test whether Italian infants will
recognize untrained familiar words in the face of a change to the first
consonant in two contrasting sets of stimuli: nonwords based on familiar
vs. rare words with medial geminates (Experiment ) and nonwords based
on familiar vs. rare words with medial singletons (Experiment ).
EXPERIMENT 
METHOD
Participants
Twenty infants were tested ( females; mean age ;·, range, ;·–
;·). Two children were excluded, one due to crying, the other due to a
technical problem. No infant had participated in Study  or Study :
Experiment . Parental education was again high: fourteen mothers and
ten fathers had a university degree.
Stimuli
In Experiment , twelve familiar and twelve rare words with medial
geminates were presented as stimuli, all with changes to the first consonant
(see ‘Appendix’: second column from the left under both FAMILIAR and
RARE, ‘medial geminate: Changed C’; available at http://dx.doi.org/.
/S). Nine of the twelve familiar words had been
produced in the recorded sessions by one or more of the children whose
data are reported in Study . In Marconi et al. () these twelve familiar
words had a mean frequency of ·, the rare words (excluding ghetto,
in addition to the Experiment  baseline words not listed in the database),
·.
Procedure
The procedure was the same as that used in Experiment .
RESULTS
The mean looking time in response to lists of familiar words with a changed
initial consonant was · s, to lists of rare words with changed initial
consonant, · s, a significant difference (t() = ·, p = ·, d = ·; see
Figure ). Sixteen of the  infants responded with longer attention to the
familiar than to the rare nonwords. A split-half analysis again revealed a
steady decline in interest in response to both sets of stimuli over the
course of the experiment, from a mean of · (s.d. ·) for familiar, ·
(s.d. ·) for rare in the first half to · (s.d. ·) for familiar, · (s.d.
·) for rare in the second half.
DISCUSSION
Study , Experiment  was designed to test whether the presence of medial
geminates is enough to draw infant attention away from the word-initial
consonant even in words with initial stress (trochaic words). When
presented with nonword forms with medial geminates derived from
familiar and rare words through changes to the initial consonant, infants
showed significantly longer looking times to the familiar words despite the
C change. Thus, change to the initial consonant (in the accented syllable)
apparently failed to block word form recognition. Furthermore, there was
no evidence of a delay in word recognition in this experiment in
comparison with the baseline: mean looking time in either the first or
second half was not appreciably lower than what was seen in Study ,
Experiment .
Failure to recognize familiar words with a changed onset consonant might
have been expected, based on the findings of Vihman et al. (). In that
study, which included three experiments with infants exposed to British
English and a reanalysis and comparison with the experiments reported by
Hallé and Boysson-Bardies (, ), split-half analysis of the baseline
experiments showed, as here in both Experiments  and , a steady decline
in infant response to the trials. However, when a change was made to the
word-initial consonant, the split-half analyses revealed that English infants
failed to distinguish familiar from rare words at any point in the
experiment, while French infants, for whom it was the onset to the
UNSTRESSED syllable that was changed, responded with more attention to
familiar words only in the second half. In short, the results of this
experiment suggest that the salience of the medial geminates may be
sufficient to distract Italian infants’ attention from the first consonant
despite the fact that it falls in the accented syllable. To test whether this
effect was truly related to the presence of the medial geminate, however,
we conducted an additional experiment, changing the first consonant of
words with medial singletons.
EXPERIMENT .
METHOD.
Participants
Twenty-one infants were tested ( females; mean age ;;, range, ;·–
;·). Two children were again excluded, one due to crying, the other due
to a technical problem. No infant had participated in Study  or Study ,
Experiments  or . Parental education was similar to that of the first two
experiments: fourteen mothers and thirteen fathers had a university degree.
Stimuli
In Experiment , twelve familiar and twelve rare words with medial
singletons were presented, with changes to the first consonant (see
‘Appendix’: last column on the right under both FAMILIAR and RARE,
‘medial singleton: Changed C’; available at http://dx.doi.org/./
S; note, however, that among both the familiar and the
rare words one word with a heterogeneous cluster was included in the
‘medial singleton’ list; based on Study , the perceptual status of
heterogeneous clusters remains unclear, as indicated above – although these
clusters seem more often to be treated as geminates than as singletons in
the children’s own forms). Seven familiar words had been produced in the
recorded sessions by one or more of the children whose data are reported
in Study . In Marconi et al. () these familiar words (again excluding
tata) had a mean frequency of ·, the rare words (except mole and the
baseline singleton words not listed in the database), ·. Thus, the
familiar singleton words used in this experiment were somewhat more
frequent, according to Marconi et al., than the familiar geminate words
used in Experiment ; the difference is not significant, however (t() =
·; p = ·).
Note that the differences between the original and the changed initial
consonants involved changes of from one to three features each (of
manner, place, and voicing). The key criterion in designing these stimuli
was to avoid creating a different real word, especially one that the children
might possibly know. In the final choices made (as shown in the
‘Appendix’; available at http://dx.doi.org/./S),
the familiar nonwords with medial geminates had slightly fewer featural
differences from the unchanged forms ( feature changes, or · per
word) than the words with medial singletons ( feature changes, or ·
per word), while the rare words of the two types had roughly the same
number of changes (geminate words, , or · per word, singleton
words, , or  per word).
Procedure
The procedure was the same as that used in Experiment .
RESULTS
In Experiment , contrary to the preceding two experiments, infants failed to
show significantly longer looking time in response to either list of words with
medial singletons and changed initial consonants. The mean looking time in
response to untrained familiar words was · s (s.d. = ·), to untrained
rare words, · (s.d. = ) (t() = ·; p = ·, d = ·: see Figure ).
Thirteen out of  infants responded with longer looks, on average, to the
familiar nonwords and  responded with longer looks, on average, to the
rare nonwords. A split-half analysis revealed a steady decline in interest in
both sets of stimuli over the course of the experiment, from a mean of
· (s.d. ·) for familiar, · (s.d. ·) for rare in the first half to ·
(s.d. ·) for familiar, · (s.d. ·) for rare in the second half. Note
that the inclusion in these lists of one familiar and one rare word with a
medial cluster might have worked against the finding that infants fail to
recognize words with initial consonant change, if the medial cluster in the
familiar word, like the geminate clusters in Experiment , served to
distract attention from the initial consonant. The presence of just one such
stimulus word out of twelve (whose ordering rotated across the trials) was
presumably insufficient to affect the overall outcome, however.
DISCUSSION
Experiment  showed that, in the case of words with (mainly) singletons,
change to the word-initial consonant, the onset of the accented syllable in
all cases, was sufficient to block infant word-form recognition. This shows
that where no geminates occur word-medially, the onset consonant of the
accented syllable plays an important role in word-form recognition, as it
does in English and French (Vihman et al., ). This supports our
interpretation of the findings of Experiment , in which familiar words
attracted significantly longer infant attention than rare words despite the
change to the onset consonant: it appears to be the presence of the
word-medial geminates in that experiment that led the children to
overlook the unexpected onset consonant in otherwise familiar words.
<Conclusion>
GENERAL DISCUSSION
This study was designed to test a hypothesis suggested by previous studies of
children’s early word production in Finnish and other languages with
geminates, replicated here with Italian in Study . The medial geminate in
adult target words is commonly associated with infant adoption of a
<VCCV> template, with children adapting to this template even words
with an easily produced, early learned onset stop or nasal consonant such
as labial /p/, /b/, or /m/ or coronal /t/, /d/, or /n/. Thus we reasoned that
it might be the salience of the medial geminates that deflects attention
from the onset consonant, resulting in ‘oversupply’ of early child word
forms in <VCCV>. In the first study we examined closely the proportion
of Italian words experienced, attempted, and produced with geminates and
of those adapted to the onsetless pattern; in the second study we tested for
a perceptual effect of geminates on onset consonants in trochaic disyllables.
In Study , Experiment  demonstrated that Italian infants aged ;, like
infants exposed only to French, English, or Dutch, listen with greater
attention to words heard frequently in the home (‘familiar words’) than to
words unlikely to have been heard before the experiment (‘rare words’).
Based on that baseline confirmation, we presented two other groups of
infants of the same age with longer lists of familiar and rare words,
restricting the stimuli to words with either medial geminates (Experiment )
or (mainly) singletons (Experiment ) and changing the initial consonant.
Under these conditions – and unlike infants exposed to English, which
shares with Italian the trochaic accentual pattern of most disyllables
learned in the early-word period – the infants showed interest in the
familiar words with changed onset consonant if the word form included a
medial geminate. When the medial consonant was a singleton, however,
word-form recognition was blocked by the change to the onset consonant,
just as it is in English (Vihman et al., ).
These findings appear to validate our initial hypothesis: in a language with
regular occurrence of geminates, their perceptual salience is such that
children are led to disregard changes to the onset consonant in trochaic
words when the word includes a medial geminate. Note, however, that
although accent-based lengthening of the second syllable appears to draw
infants’ attention away from the onset consonant in French, as suggested
by the fact that changes to that consonant fail to block word-form
recognition, OMISSION of the word-initial consonant (onset to the
unaccented syllable in French) – not tested here – did block recognition in
the French study (Hallé & Boysson-Bardies, ). Yet the early words of
French children, like the Italian words reported here, often show
initial-consonant omission. Thus the parallel between perception and
production is a subtle one: the presence of non-initial syllable accent (as in
French) or medial geminates (as in Italian) is associated with infants
disregarding changes to that consonant in word-form recognition and
omitting it in production, but when presented with forms like those they
later produce themselves – e.g. lapin as /apε̃/ (Hallé & Boysson-Bardies,
, Table ; compare Charles at ; in Vihman, , Table : lapin
[ɑpa]) – they fail to recognize the words.
Thus the <VCCV> template can be taken to derive from both the
perceptual salience and the articulatory accessibility of long consonants.
Before accepting this conclusion we should consider some additional
complications, however. First, although more disyllabic trochaic words
were targeted with geminates than with either medial singletons or
heterogeneous consonant clusters at both age levels, the proportion of
those with omitted onset consonant was highest among words with
medial heterogeneous clusters in the target, not geminates, at both age
levels (% at ;, % at ;: see Table ). As indicated above, the
distinction between geminate and heterogeneous clusters is blurred by the
fact that in the majority of forms produced in this study the Italian
children realize both types of clusters as long consonants, and this is
particularly characteristic of the forms with a missing onset consonant.
This may or may not mean that heterogeneous clusters, like geminates,
distract attention from the onset, a proposition not tested here. In English,
with its many medial clusters (typically reduced to singletons until well
into the third year of life: Grunwell, ), we find no tendency to adopt
a <VCV> template. However, there is evidence from Polish, a language
with far more clusters than either English or Italian (and with fixed
penultimate stress, so trochaic disyllables) but with no geminates, that at
least the one child observed in Szreder () initially focused his
attention on the challenge of medial cluster production at the expense of
the onset consonant or cluster.
Second, note that, as shown in Tables  and , children also produce target
words with medial singletons (i.e. CVCV words) without the word-initial
consonant. Although at ; there is a significantly greater likelihood of
onset consonant omission in child production of words with medial
geminates than medial singletons, this is not the case at ;, when these
contrasting target word shapes are about equally likely to be produced
without an onset. Yet the results of Experiment  indicate that younger
children hearing words with medial singletons DO NOT disregard the onset
consonant: Change to that consonant blocks word recognition. Thus the
occurrence of CVCV target words adapted to a <VCV> template (e.g.
giochi /dʒɔki/ ‘toys’ [ɔki], moto /mɔto/ ‘motorcycle’ [ɔto]) is not what we
might expect, given the results of Experiment . One way of accounting
for children’s adaptation of words with singletons to an onsetless
(<VCV>) word template is to infer that it reflects a generalization of the
<VCCV> pattern, based on the infants’ motoric experience or production
routine with the very common (and overproduced) medial-geminate
words. To determine whether this is a plausible interpretation we first
consider some data from Finnish to ascertain the proportion of adaptation
of words with medial geminates vs. singletons to a <VC(C)V> template.
In Finnish the <VC(C)V> template accounted for a mean of % of all
tokens produced by ten children at the wp (based on data from
Kunnari, ). Four children produced over % of their words as VC(:)
V (Vihman & Velleman, ). Eight out of ten children adapted words
with initial consonants to fit the template. Of these adaptations, nineteen
had medial geminates in the target form, seven had singletons; no child
adapted only words with singletons. In two case studies, Sini adapted
seven of her first fifty-seven words to VCCV, two to VCV
(Savinainen-Makkonen, ); Joel adapted five of his first fifty words to
VCCV, one to VCV (Savinainen-Makkonen, ). Thus in Finnish the
adaptation to <VCV> of words with medial singletons is a relatively
minor phenomenon.
Returning to Italian, we discussed above the findings shown in Table ,
which indicate that although target disyllables with all three types of
medial consonants or clusters are sometimes adapted to the onsetless
pattern, most of the words involved have heterogeneous clusters at both
ages, and words with geminates are not significantly different from words
with singletons in this regard at ; but make up a significantly larger
proportion at ;. Furthermore, whereas at ; five of the seven words
with medial singletons that are adapted to the pattern have disyllabic
targets, at ; only eight of the twenty-three words with singletons
adapted to the pattern have disyllabic targets; the remaining fifteen have
three- or four-syllable long target forms. In other words, the omission of
the onset consonant, rare in words with singletons in Finnish, may occur
more frequently in Italian in part due to the presence of large numbers of
basic vocabulary words that exceed the children’s typical production limit
of two syllables. (Note that Finnish also includes many long words,
particularly in comparison with English. However, Finnish long words are
often morphologically complex – e.g. nuku-maan ‘sleep-ing’; cf. nuku-u
‘sleep-s’; Savinainen-Makkonen, a, b.)
This suggests that the challenge of producing three- and four-syllable
words constitutes an additional factor contributing to onset consonant
omission in Italian.
Both the increase in use of the <VC(C)V> template seen in the session
recorded six months later for the same children and the evidence of
significantly greater use of initial consonant omission in words with
geminates than in words with singletons in that later session are consistent
with the interpretation proposed here, that disregard of the onset
consonant is a perceptual response to medial geminates. The extension of
this pattern to words with singletons, despite the experimental evidence
that onset consonants constitute an important part of children’s
representations of such words, appears then to be traceable to two factors:
the challenge of producing words that exceed the children’s length
constraint in production and the motoric experience of producing words
without an onset consonant that may be the long-term result of the
selection and adaptation of words with geminates to the <VCCV> template.
The findings reported here provide additional support for the whole-word
phonology model described above by demonstrating the effect of a feature
occurring word-medially on both production and perception of the word
as a whole. Many experimental studies of word recognition have been
taken to demonstrate the ‘phonetically (or phonologically) detailed’ nature
of early word representations (for a review, see Vihman, , Ch. ).
Nevertheless, the evidence of an effect of medial geminates on infant
attention to the word-initial consonant suggests that some aspects of these
early representations are more accurate than others. These findings also
suggest that these representations reflect, like adult memory for unfamiliar
proper nouns (James & Fogler, ), the salience for the listener of parts
of words that are either prosodically heightened (i.e. accented syllables,
geminates) or motorically familiar (based on existing representations and
routines), or both.
