In order to recognize spoken words, children must harbor a very precise set
of expectations about
the relationship between sound and meaning.
Formulating this set of expectations is complicated by the inordinate
variability intrinsic to human speech. Learners must learn from experience
how to assign appropriate relevance to the full range of variation in
speech, gradually converging upon a phonological system that is closely
aligned with the structure of the native lexicon. Phonological speciﬁcation
within the developing lexicon has been extensively studied in Romance

and Germanic languages, such as English, Spanish, and French (e.g. Mani &
Plunkett, ; Nazzi, ; Swingley & Aslin, , ; White &
Morgan, ). In contrast, such investigations remain a relative rarity in
tone languages, yet tone languages comprise the linguistic majority. They
are widely spoken around the world and are more frequent than non-tone
(or intonation) languages (Fromkin, ; Yip, ). Moreover, over half
of the world’s population speak a native tone language (Fromkin, ), yet
empirical studies of language acquisition focus predominantly on native
learners of intonation languages. A by-product of a disproportionately
weighty focus on languages such as English for understanding of the
phonological
lexicon is that eﬀects of vowels and consonants on word
recognition have been widely researched. In contrast, our understanding of
the consequences of tone variation on word recognition remains limited.
The purpose of the current study is to investigate the speciﬁcity of
phonological representations for tones by exploring children’s responses to
diﬀerent types of lexical tone variation in spoken word recognition.

Tone languages are deﬁned by tripartite phonological systems, which draw
distinctions in word meaning by varying three levels of the phonological
code: consonants, vowels, and lexical tone. The last source of variation,
lexical tone, entails syllable-level shifts in fundamental frequency (or in its
perceptual correspondent, vocal pitch), amplitude, and duration (Blicher,
Diehl & Cohen, ; Edmondson & Esling, ; Leather, ; Liu &
Samuel, ; Whalen & Xu, ; Wong & Diehl, ). The most
widely spoken tone language, Mandarin Chinese, has four lexical tones:
Tone  (high level tone), Tone  (rising tone), Tone  (dipping tone), and
Tone  (falling tone) (see Figure  for a depiction of Mandarin Chinese
tones). Each tone communicates word meaning in conjunction with vowels
and consonants. For example, the word ma assumes diﬀerent meanings
based on the tone in which it is produced. Ma means ‘mother’ when
spoken in Tone , ‘hemp’ when spoken in Tone , ‘horse’ when spoken in
Tone , and ‘to scold’ when said in Tone . Learners of a tone language
therefore have to simultaneously track meaningful variation in vowels,
consonants, and tones to arrive at the phonological determinants of meaning.
in experimental research, children’s abilities to track
phonological determinants of meaning were studied by investigating the
accuracy and eﬃciency with which they recognized spoken words. More
speciﬁcally, measuring children’s sensitivity to words that deviate from their
correct form via a phonological substitution (e.g. ﬁxation to an image of a cup
upon hearing tup versus cup) have provided us with a powerful means with
which to scrutinize the early phonological lexicon and the level of speciﬁcity
therein. Studies
in this area, notably mispronunciation studies, have
contributed signiﬁcantly to our understanding of the degree of phonological
deﬁnition associated with the nascent lexicon. These investigations have also

revealed some of the constraints on children’s sensitivity to mispronunciations,
reporting moderating eﬀects of the particular task employed (e.g. preferential
looking versus categorization tasks), the speciﬁc contrast used, the extent of
deviation from the correct pronunciation, and of the age at which children are
tested (e.g. Curtin, Fennell & Escudero, ; Havy, Bertoncini & Nazzi,
; Mani, Coleman & Plunkett, ; Mani & Plunkett, , ; Singh,

For the most part, mispronunciation studies have focused on manipulating
vowels and consonants within familiar words and comparing children’s
responses to correct and mispronounced words. A much more marginal
emphasis has been placed on researching how learners of tone languages
represent
tones in their early lexicon. Thus far, experimental
studies on sensitivity to lexical tone in native learners of tone languages
have focused on whether
tones via
habituation paradigms, rather than on the strength with which tone is
represented in developing lexical representations. Discrimination studies
have demonstrated that the ability to distinguish lexical tones is observed
in tone language learning infants within the ﬁrst four to six months of life
(Mattock & Burnham, ; Yeung, Chen & Werker, ), suggesting
that sensitivity to tone contrasts is solidiﬁed in the tone learner prior to
vowels and consonants (Yeung et al., ).

A question to arise from the conclusion that tone sensitivity emerges early
in infancy is whether this high degree of sensitivity applies across the native
tone inventory or whether it is speciﬁc to particular tones. Tsao ()
investigated Mandarin-learning infants’ abilities to discriminate diﬀerent
pairs of lexical tones at – months of age, revealing that infants’
abilities to discriminate lexical tones was mediated by the particular tone
contrast involved: salient Mandarin tone contrasts such as Tones  (high
level) and  (dipping) tones were discriminated more accurately than very
similar tones such as Tone  (rising) and Tone  (dipping). Similar
asynchronies in tone discrimination have also been observed in early
childhood (Eliot, ; Hao, ; Kiriloﬀ, ; Wong, Schwartz &
Jenkins, ; Wong ). This suggests that individual tones may be
represented with unequal strength in infants’ learning systems. Each of
these prior studies has revealed diﬀerent degrees of sensitivity to tone
variation based on properties of individual tone pairs. Speciﬁcally, as the
similarity between tones increases, sensitivity to the tone contrast has been
shown to increase incrementally (e.g. Tsao, ; Wong , ), a
phenomenon also documented in studies
investigating sensitivity to
phonetic segments such as consonants (White & Morgan, ).

Prior studies with phonetic segments, such as consonants, invite the strong
possibility that patterns observed in auditory discrimination tasks do not
always predict behavior in word learning tasks. Speciﬁcally, successfully
discriminated sounds in infancy are not always discretely bound to lexical
representations in early childhood (e.g. Stager & Werker, ; Werker,
Fennell, Corcoran & Stager, ). It is well attested that infants may be
highly sensitive to particular sources of sound variation in a non-lexical
context, but when they are faced with the added, simultaneous demands of
linking the same sources of variation to meaning, they can exhibit a lesser
awareness of phonological contrast (see Curtin, Byers-Heinlein & Werker,
, for a discussion of these issues).

There has been one prior study investigating tone sensitivity in word
recognition in a sample of tone language learners. In a study by Singh
et al. (), two groups of Mandarin-learning children (toddlers and
preschoolers) were presented with familiar words that were either correctly
pronounced or altered via a consonant, vowel, or tone mispronunciation.
Each vowel and consonant mispronunciation entailed a single feature
substitution and tone mispronunciations
substitutions
between Tones , , and . Children were tested at two age groups (· to
· years and  to  years). At both age groups, children showed similar
degrees of sensitivity to vowel and consonant substitutions and a distinct
pattern of results for tone substitutions. This strongly suggests that it may
not be viable to generalize from the wealth of knowledge on consonant and
vowel representation to lexical tones, which may follow a unique course of

acquisition. In particular, toddlers demonstrated a very strong sensitivity to
tone substitutions as compared with vowels and consonants, leading the
authors to conclude that at this age children are very sensitive to tones as a
source of lexical contrast. This complements ﬁndings from infant auditory
discrimination, revealing that native sensitivity to lexical tones emerges
precociously, relative to vowels and consonants (see Yeung et al., ).
Older children, however, demonstrated relatively strong mispronunciation
eﬀects for vowels and consonants as compared with the toddler sample.
However, they demonstrated relatively weak mispronunciation eﬀects for
tones, although tone mispronunciations were reliable detected. The
authors attributed this attenuation in tone discrimination to a growing
appreciation for the multiplex of functions served by pitch in language,
such as conveyance of emotional prosody, emphatic stress, questions
versus statements. The functional diﬀerentiation of pitch may be a late
developing ability that emerges in the preschool years, as suggested by
prior studies (Quam & Swingley, ; Singh & Chee, ). The early
attentiveness to lexical pitch reported in the toddler sample, however, is of
direct relevance to the current study. In particular, conclusions ventured
by Singh et al. (), that tone is preferentially encoded in early word
representations in toddlers, were based on an aggregate response to tone
mispronunciations, collapsing across diﬀerent tone contrasts. Each of the
tone mispronunciations entailed relatively salient contrasts. Moreover, the
most diﬃcult tone contrast to discriminate – Tones  and  – was not
included in this study. Tones  and  present an interesting pair to
investigate as they are acoustically similar and they are also related via
phonological rules. Speciﬁcally, the Tone  sandhi rule prescribes that
when two syllables marked with Tone  appear in direct succession, the
ﬁrst syllable is substituted by Tone . Consequently, under particular
contexts, Tone  can be considered an allotone of Tone  (Chen, ).
As a result of acoustic similarity and joint involvement in tone sandhi,
Tones  and  present an interesting point of a comparison to more distal
tone pairs. The current study investigates eﬀects of variation caused by
subtle tone changes (Tones  and ) and more salient tone changes (Tones
 and ). The current study therefore aims to scrutinize the strong
sensitivity reported for tones in prior studies (e.g. Singh et al., ;
Yeung et al., ), by investigating the inﬂuence of diﬀerent
tone
pairings on children’s sensitivity to mispronunciations of tone.

In the present study, Mandarin-learning preschoolers were presented with
a series of familiar words. Words were either correctly pronounced or
mispronounced via

interchanging the target tone with a dissimilar tone (alternation between
Tones  and ) or with a similar tone (alternation between Tones  and

Stimuli

Auditory stimuli. Twenty-four imageable monosyllabic common nouns
(i.e.  tokens from each lexical tone category: high, rising, dipping, and
falling) were selected as stimuli. A female native speaker of Mandarin
Chinese recorded all the tokens in a sound-attenuated recording booth in
an infant-directed register. All
target words were presented in
sentence-ﬁnal position with the carrier phrase: “你看, [target]!” (‘Look!
[target]!’). The total pool of twenty-four nouns were distributed into three
versions of the experiment (with  words per condition). Within each
version, each of the eight words was either correctly pronounced ( trials)
or mispronounced ( trials). The diﬀerence between experimental
conditions was only the stimulus set used; three conditions were created to
ensure a reasonably large set of stimuli across all participants and to ensure
that conclusions and generalizations were not drawn based on a relatively
small set of eight lexical items (see Table  for a list of all stimuli and
versions).

Visual stimuli. Visual stimuli consisted of photographed images of targets
and distractors. All visual
stimuli were presented against a white
background. Each image was scaled to  ×  pixels. Areas of interest
(AoIs) were set at  ×  pixels to ensure that each visual stimulus was
contained within the AoIs. Images were horizontally aligned. The side of
presentation of the target was counterbalanced within subjects. The target
image was always a familiar object and the distractor image was always an
unfamiliar object. This decision was made on the grounds that target
selection in the face of familiar target and distractor pairings can be
inﬂuenced by the phonological properties of the target as well as the
properties of the distractor. In other words, target selection could arise

Stimulus validation. To ensure that lexical identity of the tokens was
conveyed as intended, acoustic analyses were conducted on all recorded
stimuli to obtain pitch characteristics of the target words. For each token,
mean fundamental frequency (F), fundamental frequency at onset and
oﬀset, and fundamental frequency range were calculated and averaged
across lexical tone categories. For Tone  (high tone), there was minimal
pitch variation from syllable onset to syllable oﬀset (F range:  Hz to
 Hz) and a high overall mean pitch ( Hz). Tone  (rising tone)
showed the largest increase in pitch from syllable onset to syllable oﬀset (
Hz to  Hz; mean F:  Hz). Tone  (dipping tone) showed an
intermediate onset pitch ( Hz) followed by an inﬂection point ( Hz)
and ended with a terminal rise to  Hz. Tone  (falling tone) began
with the highest onset pitch ( Hz) and ended with a low terminal pitch
( Hz). All tokens were consistent with expected pitch contours for
Mandarin tones. Mean pitch, minimum pitch, onset and oﬀset pitch, and
pitch range did not vary based on whether the tone-bearing syllable was a
correct pronunciation or a tone substitution (all p values > ·). Twelve

native adult speakers of Mandarin Chinese were asked to categorize stimuli
into lexical tone categories. All tokens were identiﬁed with high accuracy:
Tone  (%), Tone  (%), Tone  (%), and Tone  (%).

Apparatus and procedure
The Preferential Looking Paradigm was employed in the current study as
realized in prior studies to investigate sensitivity to mispronunciations of
familiar words (e.g. Mani & Plunkett, ; Singh et al., ; White &
Morgan, ). The Tobii XL eye-tracking system (Version .·) was
used. All participants were seated  cm away from a -inch Tobii XL
monitor, which was placed comfortably at eye level. Auditory stimuli were
presented at a conversation level via left–right speakers embedded within
the monitor. An experimenter manually coded % of the data obtained
from Tobii. Inter-coder reliability was ..

The experiment began with two training trials that served to familiarize
children to the task followed by sixteen test trials in a randomized order.
Each test trial was split into two phases of equal duration – the pre-naming
and the post-naming phase, with the entire trial
lasting  ms. The
visual display consisted of one familiar target object and a novel distracter
object, both of which stayed on screen for the entire duration of both
phases. In each trial, children heard the directive “你看!” (‘Look!’) during
the pre-naming phase. For each trial,
auditory stimulus was
synchronized to begin  milliseconds after the start of each trial,
initiating the post-naming phase.

Children were presented with three types of test trials: words that were
correctly pronounced (n = ), words that underwent acoustically distinct
mispronunciations (n = ; two trials involving substitutions from Tone  to
Tone , and two trials involving substitutions from Tone  to Tone ), and
words that underwent acoustically subtle mispronunciations (n = ; two
trials involving Tone  to Tone  substitutions, and two trials involving
Tone  to Tone  substitutions). Each participant heard the same word
correctly pronounced and mispronounced. Half of the mispronunciations
were subtle mispronunciations (from Tone  to Tone  and vice versa), and
half were salient mispronunciations (from Tone  to Tone  and vice versa).

from the presence of a naming eﬀect (Bailey & Plunkett, ; Meints,

). Naming eﬀects refer to a signiﬁcant elevation in ﬁxation to the

target object following naming. Naming eﬀects are computed by the
following formula: Proportion of Total Looking to the Target (PTL)
during the post-naming phase minus Proportion of Total Looking to the
Target during the pre-naming phase. The purpose of computing naming
eﬀects from both pre- and post-naming values is to mitigate eﬀects of
stimulus characteristics that may elicit preferential ﬁxation independent of
labeling. A signiﬁcant positive naming eﬀect created by an increase in
PTL between the pre- and post-naming phases is typically recruited as
evidence for children having associated the verbal label with the visual
target within a trial. In contrast, a naming eﬀect that does not deviate
signiﬁcantly from zero (i.e. no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in PTL values
between the pre- and post-naming phases)
is presumed to indicate
ambiguity with regards to the referent for the verbal label.

Naming eﬀects were computed for correct pronunciations and for
mispronunciations. As naming eﬀects did not diﬀer based on the direction
of substitution (Tone  substituted for Tone  or vice versa; Tone 
substituted for Tone  or vice versa; p > ·), they were collapsed across
direction of substitution and computed for Tone – mispronunciations,
Tone – mispronunciations, and correct pronunciations. Likewise, there
were no diﬀerences in baseline ﬁxation to targets during the pre-naming
phase across trial types (p > ·). Data from % of trials were excluded due
to failure to attend to the screen at all during individual test trials.

Naming eﬀects for each trial type are displayed in Figure a. As depicted
in Figure a, there was an elevation in ﬁxation to the target (i.e. a naming
eﬀect) for correct pronunciations and for Tone – mispronunciations.
There was no elevation in ﬁxation to the target when Tones  and  were
substituted. A series of one-sample t-tests conﬁrmed that naming eﬀects
departed signiﬁcantly from zero for correct pronunciations (t() = ·,
p = ·; Cohen’s d = ·). Likewise, naming eﬀects departed signiﬁcantly
from zero for mispronunciations involving Tones  and  (t() = ·,
p = ·; Cohen’s d = ·). There was no signiﬁcant change in naming
eﬀects in comparison to zero for substitutions involving Tone  and . All
ﬁndings
following a Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons. This demonstrates
that children preferentially
ﬁxated target objects even when they were mislabeled on account of a
Tone / substitution. Naming eﬀects were comparable when Tone  was

A second set of analyses was aimed at disaggregating naming eﬀects to
examine the temporal dynamics of word recognition. Prior studies have
revealed that a more nuanced proﬁle of lexical selection can be established
by looking at the timecourse of word recognition (e.g. Fernald, McRoberts
& Swingley, ). In particular, for the subset of trials on which infants
are ﬁxated on the distractor object at the start of the post-naming phase,
the proportion of shifts to the target for each type of pronunciation can be
used to determine the temporal processing ‘cost’ of mispronunciations
(Fernald et al., ). To examine the timecourse of lexical selection, we
plotted shifts to the target, frame-by-frame, for all distractor-initial trials
by trial type (see Figure ). Distractor-initial trials constituted % of
trials. As depicted in Figure , there are apparent diﬀerences in shifts to

statistically scrutinized by segmenting the entire test block into windows

contrast involving Tone  and  substitutions. However, an analysis of the
timecourse of
lexical selection revealed a more nuanced picture with
regards to sensitivity to Tone – substitutions: for about % of the
post-naming block, participants were less likely to ﬁxate the target object
when Tones  and  were substituted than when the object was correctly
speciﬁed for tone. This suggests that there is some degree of sensitivity to
subtle tone contrasts, and that
subtle variations are not processed
identically to correct pronunciations. However, salient
tone contrasts
appear to have been robustly rejected as possible labels for familiar target
words, as revealed by naming eﬀects and timecourse measures.

D I S C U S S I O N
The purpose of the current study was to examine the phonological precision with
which children represent lexical tones in spoken language processing. Native
speakers of Mandarin Chinese were presented with a series of familiar words,
some of which were correctly pronounced and some of which were
mispronounced. Mispronounced words involved a substitution of either
highly discriminable tones (Tones  and ) or highly similar tones (Tones 
and ). Results demonstrated that children reliably recognized correctly
pronounced forms. However, they also mis-identiﬁed substitutions of Tones 
and  as correct labels for visual targets. In contrast, substitutions of Tones 
and  were not identiﬁed as labels for visual targets. At ﬁrst glance, these
ﬁndings suggest
that participants were categorically insensitive to the
distinction between subtle tone contrasts in spoken word recognition.
However, a more detailed analysis of the timecourse of lexical selection
revealed that children were somewhat sensitive to Tone – substitutions,
exempliﬁed by a reduced proportion of shifts to the target for these trials
relative to correct pronunciations for a substantial duration of the post-naming
test block. By contrast, in comparison to correct pronunciation trials there was
a persistent reduction in shifts to the target for Tone – substitutions

comprehension of tone-bearing units is heavily inﬂuenced by the perceived

 points to a late-emerging sensitivity to subtle tone distinctions in spoken
word recognition. In perceptual discrimination tasks, tone-learning infants
at – months of age were able to distinguish this contrast, albeit less so

In the present study, there were strong diﬀerences in children’s sensitivity
to correct and subtle tone contrasts (which were treated very similarly to one
another) and salient tone contrasts, which were treated distinctly to correct/
subtle mispronunciations. Results observed herein are somewhat consistent
with prior studies on vowel variation on spoken word recognition in
toddlers, demonstrating overlapping sensitivity to correct pronunciations
and subtle mispronunciations and sharply deviating sensitivity to salient
mispronunciations (e.g. Mani & Plunkett, ). As mentioned in the
‘Introduction’, Tones  and  are not only similar but are also subject to a
process of phonological neutralization via tone sandhi. It is therefore
possible that confusion between these tones arises from this neutralization.
However, if this were the case, one would expect directional asymmetries
in mispronunciation eﬀects, as there is no situation that licenses a reversed
substitution from Tone  to Tone . Speciﬁcally, mispronunciation eﬀects
would only be predicted when Tone  was substituted for Tone , and
naming eﬀects would be predicted when Tone  was substituted for Tone
 as the latter substitution reﬂects the alternation associated with the Tone
 sandhi rule. We found no evidence of directional eﬀects on naming
eﬀects for Tone – substitutions, as shown in Figure b. Moreover, prior
studies on spoken word recognition of sandhi forms suggest that children
are not sensitive to Tone  sandhi rules until four to ﬁve years of age
(Wewalaarachchi & Singh, ), pointing to the possibility that the
conﬂation of
these forms may be primarily due to their perceptual
similarity and less so to their potential to be neutralized.

Previous investigations of tone representation across a broad range of
discrimination and word recognition tasks would suggest that tone-exposed
infants are quite sensitive to tone changes as infants and toddlers, and that
tone is preferentially encoded relative to vowels and consonants (Singh &
Foong, ; Singh et al., ; Singh, Hui, Chan & Golinkoﬀ, ; Tsao,
; Yeung et al., ). The chief contribution of the current study is to
modify the conclusion that tone information is preferentially available to
native learners. In fact, sensitivity to subtle contrasts remains quite low even
in preschoolers when children have
typically amassed substantial
vocabularies. These ﬁndings suggest that strong sensitivity to tone as a
source of lexical contrast evinced in prior studies (Singh & Foong, ;
Singh et al., ) may be speciﬁc to highly contrastive tones.

Although tone integration appears to depend on the speciﬁc tone pairs
involved, this raises the question of the types of cues that learners may
proﬁt from in learning more diﬃcult contrasts. One possibility is that the
availability of visual cues to tone may promote diﬀerentiation of these
tones. Tone , although similar to Tone  in its pitch proﬁle,
is
accompanied by distinctive facial movements in native speakers (a head
and chin dip) which are not applied when native speakers produce Tone 

(Chen & Massaro, ). These movements may help to diﬀerentiate similar
tones in an interactive context. Research with adult native speakers of tone
languages
indicates a selective underutilization of visual cues when
processing lexical tone information (i.e. performance is not augmented
when comparing auditory-only and auditory–visual conditions)
(e.g.
Burnham, Cioccia & Stokes, ; Chen & Massaro, ). However, it is
possible that young children may orient more closely to visual cues in the
face of phonological ambiguity when mastering words and tones. They
may utilize
a
phenomenon previously demonstrated in English-learning children (Jerger,
Damian, Spence, Tye-Murray & Abdi, ). Future research could
contrast eﬀects of tone similarity in an auditory-only versus multimodal
dynamic context
to determine whether disambiguation in children is
facilitated by multimodal cues. Second, the present set of ﬁndings are
highly consistent with those observed in tone productions. Tones are
sporadically contrasted in vocalizations
(Hua & Dodd, ; Li &
Thompson, ; So & Dodd, ). In particular, dissimilar tones are
contrasted in early productions, whereas similar tones such as Tone  and
 take several years to diﬀerentiate in vocal productions of tones (Wong,
, ; Wong et al., ), even though children can discriminate
auditory tokens of these tones in infancy (Tsao, ). The point in
development at which clearly diﬀerentiated productions of Tones  and 
reach adult-like targets
this ability in
production appears not to be mature even as late as four or ﬁve years of
age (Wong, ). Future research could focus on longitudinal analyses of
production and perception of similar tones to determine the extent to
which tone perception and production may reinforce
each other.

The purpose of the current study was to examine children’s abilities to
integrate
a
mispronunciation paradigm, adding to an emerging focus on tone language
acquisition. The representation of
tones in early childhood remains
elusive, due to a predominant emphasis on sensitivity to consonants and
vowels in prior research. In the current study, we observed that sensitivity
to tone variation is clearly evident when tone contrasts are salient. When
tone contrasts are more subtle, however, preschool children appear not to
be sensitive to tone variation even for familiar words. In summary, the
current ﬁndings point to strong eﬀects of acoustic similarity on children’s
abilities to integrate lexical
tones as determinants of word meaning.
Findings suggest that although infants and toddlers appear sensitive to
tone relatively early in development, as suggested by prior studies, this

not generalize across native tone inventories. By implication, future studies
should assess tone sensitivity in children across a diversity of
tone
contrasts, as responses to diﬀerent contrasts can invite very diﬀerent
conclusions on the timing of lexical tone acquisition.
