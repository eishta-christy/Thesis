A B S T R A C T

The current study examined the production of Hebrew verbal passives
across adolescence as mediated by linguistic register and verb
morphology. Participants aged eight to sixteen years and a group of
adults were asked to change written active-voice sentences into
corresponding passive-voice forms, divided by verb register (neutral and
high), binyan pattern (Qal / Nif’al, Hif’il / Huf’al, and Pi’el / Pu’al),
and verb tense (past and future tense). Results showed that Hebrew
passive morphology is a very late acquisition, almost a decade later
than in other languages, that passivizing neutral-register verbs was
less challenging than high-register verbs, and that past tense verbs
were easier
to passivize than future tense verbs. An order of
acquisition was determined among the three binyan pairs. The paper
provides an account of these ﬁndings grounded in the event-telling
role of Hebrew passives in discourse and the spurt of abstract,
lexically speciﬁc vocabulary in Later Language Development.

Passive voice is among the most prominent and widespread perspective-
changing constructions in the world’s languages (Abraham & Leisiö, ;
Givón, ; Keenan & Dryer, ). The acquisition of passive forms
by children has been the controversial topic of research studies across
the last decades (Baldie, ; Messenger, Branigan & Mclean, ).
Passive constructions have been described as delayed in some languages
(Gordon & Chafetz, ; Prat-Sala, Shillcock & Sorace, ), and as
early acquisitions in others (Allen & Crago, ; Aschermann, Gulzow &
Wendt, ; Demuth, Moloi & Machobane, ). Syntactic, semantic,
discourse, cognitive, and usage factors as well as elicitation conditions have

The current study aimed to examine the acquisition of passive forms in
Hebrew in a new light. First, focus here is on the MORPHOLOGY of the
passive verb. As general
theoretical motivation for this verb-focused
investigation, we follow Haspelmath’s (, p. ) comment that “the
verbal morphology associated with a passive construction is an essential
part of the construction whose properties are worthy of study in their own
right. Indeed, the passive can be regarded as ﬁrst and foremost a verbal
morphological category whose meaning implies certain changes in the

The main goals of the current study were as follows: (i) to provide an
account of the development of Hebrew passive verb morphology across the
school years, based on an experimental task; and (ii) to determine the role
of derivational and inﬂectional binyan morphology in this development.

Passive constructions
Passive voice seems to be a universal phenomenon; nonetheless, it has been
described as an elusive category, deserving of sound conceptual foundations
(Shibatani, ). Several conclusions come to mind when reviewing the
linguistic literature on passive constructions and their functional roles
across diﬀerent languages, which can be useful in laying the background
and generating expectations for the current developmental
study of
Hebrew passives.

First, passives are noted among the most prominent and widespread
perspective-changing constructions

(Myhill, ). We adopt here Keenan and Dryer’s () analysis of the
passive as essentially diﬀerent

languages in
occupying unmarked positions and the case marking of NPs, in requiring
no speciﬁc intonation patterns, and in undergoing all major syntactic
operations. According to Keenan and Dryer, the most distinctive property
of passives is the formation of the passive verb phrase (Haspelmath, ).
This supports our focus on the morphology of Hebrew passive verbs in
investigating their acquisitional path.

to the grammar of

A second observation from the cross-linguistic literature indicates that the
notion of ‘passive’ often serves as an umbrella term for a cluster of
constructions sharing the perspective of the patient. Across languages,
these include middle voice and impersonal constructions (Abraham &
Leiss, ), in addition to get-passives, medial passives, and adjectival
passives (Mitkovska & Bužarovska, ; Rathert, ), all participating
in diﬀerent conﬁgurations of agent and patient roles in the event. Viewed
from a developmental psycholinguistic perspective, passives constitute one
form of voice construction whose function is to depict a non-canonical
view on events and situations. This can generate the expectation that a
language learner would need to gain experience not only with variegated

A third conclusion drawn from the literature is the strong relationship
between transitivity and voice, on the one hand, and between aspect
and voice, on the other (Abraham & Leisiö, ; Shibatani, ).
Middle voice constructions tend to express a generic and imperfective
outlook, e.g. these books sell well. Passive voice,
in contrast, prefers a
transitive construction that expresses the patient argument in an object
NP, with an agentive, volitional grammatical subject and a concrete,
actional verb aﬀecting the object, as in the alternation John built the IKEA
chest / the IKEA chest was built by John. No less importantly, expression
of canonical passive voice is associated with realis, concrete/agentive
transitivity, and perfective temporality (Foley, ). In a language such
as Hebrew, which does not mark aspectual distinctions in verb inﬂectional
morphology, this means a strong association of passive forms with the
narrative past tense – unlike telic past, which strongly associates with
middle/inchoative semantics (Berman & Slobin, ). This generates two
expectations:
less agentive and object-
aﬀecting Hebrew verbs should be more challenging to children; and that
future tense passive forms should be more diﬃcult to passivize than past

tense verbs. The relationship between resultative predicates and passive
verbs has been shown to beneﬁt learning (Lee & Lee, ), but the tense
hypothesis,
to our best knowledge, has not been tested before. The
acquisition literature (see below) has long known that actional passive
constructions are comprehended earlier than non-actional ones (Maratsos,
Fox, Becker & Chalkley, ), but testing passive formation in late
childhood adolescence makes it possible to examine a much richer array of
cognitive and abstract verbs.

Acquisition of passive constructions
The acquisition of passive forms by children has been the controversial topic
of numerous research studies across the last decades regarding the timing of
the acquisition of passive forms and the reasons thereof (Budwig, ;
Crain, Thornton & Murasugi, ). Much of the investigation of passive
acquisition has focused on English, where it was often described as
delayed to age six years in both comprehension and production (Brooks &
Tomasello, ; Marchman, Bates, Burkardt & Good, ). Children
were shown to experience particular diﬃculty when full passives – that is,
the whole syntactic structure including the by-phrase – were involved (Fox
& Grodzinsky, ). The realization that
the passive is a complex
phenomenon with diﬀerent parts and facets dictates a more nuanced view
of passive learning as a drawn-out process of learning. Many studies have
shown that young children start by attending to semantically restricted,
prototypical passives – that is, irreversible passives with actional verbs and
animate subjects (Ferreira, ; Pinker et al., ). Children initially
prefer less patient-oriented, agent-demoting devices, such as the get
passive or middle voice (Gámez, Shimpi, Waterfall & Huttenlocher, ).
Only later on, beyond age six and even later, does children’s knowledge go
beyond the canonical passive (Messenger et al., ).

Frequency of passive forms and their discourse contexts in the input have
often been invoked as determining factors in children’s acquisition of
passives (Tomasello, Brooks & Stern, ). Thus, the rarity of agentless
and passive constructions in English input to children (Gordon & Chafetz,
) could explain the discrepancy in reports on timing of acquisition.
Investigations of the early emergence of passive forms (around age two) in
languages with prevalent passive constructions such as Bantu languages,
Inuktitut, and Quiche Mayan, have ruled out a universal maturational
constraint on passive learning (Alcock, Rimba & Newton, ; Allen &
Crago, ; Demuth et al., ; Pye & Quixtan Poz, ). But
children acquiring languages with lower frequencies of passive forms than
English, such as Catalan or Hebrew, are reported to continue struggling
with passive production even beyond age ten (Prat-Sala et al., ;

Ravid, ). At the same time, exposure of child and adult participants to
passive constructions of all types has been shown to enhance their passive
productions (Gámez et al., ). Thus,
the literature suggests that
learners are sensitive to the way the immediate and general linguistic input
employs passive constructions in the depiction of diﬀerent agent-demoting
scenes.

Passive voice in Hebrew
Syntactically, the active/passive alternation in Hebrew is rather similar to
that of English. Consider the pair of Hebrew sentences in (), which
express active (a) and passive (b) voice perspectives on the same event.

()

a. ha-texnay

hiklit

the-technician recorded
‘The technician recorded the interview’

ha-re’ayon

et
ACC the-interview

b. ha-re’ayon

huklat

al-yedey ha-texnay
the-interview was-recorded by the-technician
‘The interview was recorded by the technician’

The active version (a) has a grammatical subject depicting the agent
ha-texnay ‘the technician’ at sentence-initial position, and a direct object
patient ha-re’ayon ‘the interview’ marked by accusative et, following the
transitive verb. In (b), the patient serves as subject at sentence-initial
position, followed by the passive verb. The by-phrase is a crucial test of
passive voice in Hebrew, since only truly passive (as opposed to medial
passive) constructions can take it. The scope of the Hebrew passive is
notably less broad than in English, as passivization is generally restricted
to transitive constructions with direct, sometimes oblique, objects. Unlike
English, Hebrew does not allow passivization of
indirect objects in
ditransitive constructions such as Mary handed the ﬂowers to John / John
was handed the ﬂowers by Mary.

Two language-speciﬁc, structural, and functional characteristics render
the Hebrew passive very diﬀerent from that of English, providing grounds
for further hypotheses regarding acquisition. One is its Semitic verb
morphology; another is the prevalence of generic subjectless constructions
in Hebrew.

Passive verb morphology. Like all Hebrew verbs, passive verbs are formed
within the binyan system by the Semitic non-linear aﬃxation of root and
pattern morphemes. Semitic roots are discontinuous morphemes consisting
of three or four radicals, which constitute the structural and semantic core
of Hebrew words in general and verbs in particular, e.g. root g-d-l ‘grow’
or root t-q-n ‘ﬁx’. All Hebrew verbs are constructed by combining a root
termed binyanim (literally
with one

‘buildings’) – traditionally named Qal, Nif’al, Hif’il, Huf’al, Pi’el, Pu’al,
and Hitpa’el (based on the root p-’-l ‘act’). Binyan conjugations provide
the main vocalic structure of
the verb (sometimes accompanied by
preﬁxation). For example, Pi’el provides the CiCeC template into which
the root (marked by capital Cs) is inserted. In addition, each binyan
consists of a speciﬁc bundle of temporal patterns that combine with a root
to create its paradigm of temporal stems. For example, gidel, megadel, and
yegadel serve as the respective past, present, and future tense stems of
‘raise’ in Pi’el.

three arguments, or

The binyan system not only dictates the morphological structure of verbs,
but also how transitivity relations, including passive voice, are expressed
syntactically. Thus, binyan patterns are associated with higher or lower
transitivity values, with correspondingly richer or poorer argument
structures – e.g. high-transitivity Hif’il, which is often associated with two
low-transitivity Nif’al, mostly occurring in
or
single-argument structures (Berman, ). In this respect, Hebrew binyan

verb conjugations, which are
morphophonological
in nature (Monachesi, ), and are somewhat
similar to Slavic verb formation, which is also associated with aspect and
Aktsionsart (Svenonius, ). Hebrew root-based verbs with diﬀerent
binyan patterns constitute semi-productive derivational families combining
lexically speciﬁc meanings with Aktionsart values such as inchoativity,
causativity, reﬂexivity, reciprocity, middle, and passive voice (see Berman
& Nir-Sagiv, , p. , for a detailed table). For example, root g-d-l
‘grow’ combines with binyan patterns to create a family of six diﬀerent
verbs – two of which in passive voice: basic gadal ‘grow’, causative higdil
‘enlarge’, passive hugdal ‘be enlarged’, causative gidel ‘raise’, passive
gudal ‘be raised’, and middle-reﬂexive hitgadel ‘aggrandize oneself’.

Passive verb formation takes place within this morphologically stringent
root-binyan verb system. Hebrew passive morphosyntax is based on the
three transitive binyan patterns – Qal, Hif’il, and Pi’el, each associated
with a dedicated passive counterpart: Qal with Nif’al, Hif’il with Huf’al,
and Pi’el with Pu’al (Table ). In the current context, we investigate
VERBAL passives, that is, passive verbs in the past and future tense, rather
than resultative adjectival passives, which are based on the present tense
stems of passive binyan patterns, such as Pu’al metukan ‘ﬁxed’ or Huf’al
mufta ‘surprised’ (Berman, ). Adjectival passives constitute a major

In one sense, passive morphology is the most predictable of all binyan
functions, as choice of passive binyan is always entailed by its active
counterpart (Table ). However, the three patterns expressing passive
voice are not uniform – rather, they fall into two distinct groups: strict
passives (Pu’al and Huf’al), and Nif’al. Pu’al and Huf’al passives share
several unique features. First, the passive voice is their only functional
role, so that their existence is predicated on that of a corresponding
transitive Hif’il or Pi’el verb. Structurally, they share the vowel u across
their temporal paradigms, and unlike all other binyan patterns, they do not
have inﬁnitive forms (Table ). Again, unlike all other patterns, Pu’al and
Huf’al form their action nominals by attaching the abstract suﬃx -ut to
‘readi-ness’ or
tense
their
adjectival present
me’orav-ut ‘involve-ment’
(Ravid & Avidor, ). Importantly, their
present
tense forms express both passive participial and resultative
meanings, so that mefursam in Pu’al can be interpreted as both ‘is being
published’ and ‘famous’. Nif’al, in contrast, has several characteristics that
mark its special status (Schwarzwald, ). First, in addition to its role as
the passive counterpart of Qal, it has most of the middle functions of
Hitpa’el, serving as the inceptive and inchoative counterpart of Hif’il
(Berman, ). Moreover, and again unlike the strict passives, present
tense participial Nif’al participates in a tripartite system with Qal and the
resultative pattern CaCuC, as in Qal kotev ‘is writing’ / CaCuC katuv
‘written’ / Nif’al nixtav ‘is being written’. Structurally, too, Nif’al does
not have the typical passive u vowel of the strict passives, and again,
unlike them, it has an inﬁnitival stem and a derived action nominal like
all other non-passive binyan patterns. Finally, Nif’al is the only binyan
(or for that matter, any derivational pattern in Hebrew) starting with

e.g. muxan-ut

morphology, using the
the
expression of other binyan functions. There is nothing special about the
morphophonology of either the strict passives or Nif’al: the developmental
literature shows that present tense adjectival passives with u are found in
child speech (e.g. mekulkal ‘out of order’, hafux ‘upside down’). Moreover,
telic Nif’al verbs such as nishpax ‘spilled’ or nirtav ‘got wet’ are among
the earliest past tense forms to occur in child speech, with medial passive
Hitpa’el forms such as hitparek ‘fell apart’ soon following in their steps
(Berman, ). Therefore, morphological structure alone cannot be the
culprit in the very late acquisition of passive voice in Hebrew. We argue
that the problem lies elsewhere, at the interface of syntactic constructions
and event structure in the ambient language.

subjectless/verbless constructions, they require a grammatical subject and are
based on lexical verbs that take all temporal
inﬂections, favoring the

perfective past
regarded as the cause of delayed passive acquisition in Hebrew, as children
produce the required, grammatically integral SV(O) structures (Keenan &
Dryer, ) fairly early, including many with non-agentive subjects and
unaccusative verbs (Berman, ). Relating diﬀerent structures should
not be challenging to Hebrew-speaking children, who are early on exposed
to and produce sentences with pragmatically alternating word orders such
as () (Ravid, ).

We argue that the FUNCTIONAL ROLE reserved in Hebrew to passive verb
constructions is the gist of the problem. In direct contrast to generic,
present

functionally pinpoint highly transitive, perfective EVENTS, either realis or
irrealis, as in ().

Passive constructions thus require the expression of speciﬁc, perfective
events through an abstract and distanced agent-demoting stance, which
does not characterize early child language interaction. This restricted
functional role predicts a prolonged period of learning passive voice,
enabled by socio-cognitive changes in adolescence during Later Language
Development
). Learning passive
constructions in Hebrew is based on gaining extensive experience with the
appropriate communicative contexts of event- and story-telling, and the
passive constructions associated with them; and the ability to perceive
multiple perspectives, as well as familiarity with literate, written language
styles that prefer such forms of expression (Berman & Ravid, ).

Learning Hebrew passives. Most research on Hebrew passive acquisition to
date has focused on its distributions in child, adolescent, and adult corpora.
Verbal passives of Pu’al and Huf’al were virtually absent in spoken mother–
child interactions, child-directed speech, child speech, children’s peer talk
(Berman,
spoken
personal-experience story-telling (Berman & Slobin, ). They were also
negligible (under %) in the written narrative and expository texts of
Hebrew-speaking high-schoolers
and even university-educated adults
(Berman & Nir-Sagiv, ). Past tense (no future tense) Pu’al and Huf’al
verbs constituted under % of verb types and tokens in children’s story-books
and early school texts. Passive Nif’al past and future tense forms in the same
corpora were as sparse. However, passive verb usage was noted as a prominent
high register marker in the expression of detached, abstract discourse stance in
adolescent and adult discourse production (Berman & Ravid, ; Ravid &
Berman, ), with special concentration in adult narrative writing (Ravid &
Chen-Djemal, ). This supports our hypothesis regarding the special role
passive constructions occupy in Hebrew event-telling and the drawn-out route
to learning their usage contexts in the language.

Ravid () reviewed several small-scale Hebrew-language experimental
studies where past tense passive constructions were elicited in school-aged
children. They all showed that, by age ten, syntactic errors in passive
sentences were negligible, but correct production of passive morphology
was still at %. A number of studies that elicited passive forms in
morphosyntactic tasks had the same results (Ravid & Geiger, ),
showing correct production of passive verb morphology at ceiling only by
late adolescence (Ravid & Saban, ). Relatedly, Ravid and Epel
Mashraki () reported strong correlations between passive production,
prosodic reading, and reading comprehension in nine-year-olds. Across all
of these studies, Nif’al had the highest correct scores and attracted the
most errors, leading us to assume that it constituted the bridge leading
towards strict passives, given the prominence of intransitive, telic, and
change-of-state Nif’al forms in early childhood (Berman, ).

To sum up, corpora studies indicated the marked absence of passive
constructions from spoken and written Hebrew texts, except
for the
speciﬁc, adult preference for narrating events from a distanced discourse
stance. Correspondingly, passive
verb production in experimental
conditions outlined a learning path starting very late, around age nine,
reaching command only by late adolescence. Given children’s command
of Hebrew verb morphology and argument structure in early childhood,
we hypothesized that the delay in learning Hebrew passives does not
derive from syntactic nor morphological factors, but rather from the rare
encounters with Hebrew passive constructions that are the direct outcome
of their speciﬁc narrative role coupled with a detached and general stance.

Linguistic register. A critical component of the current study is the notion
of LINGUISTIC REGISTER, characterized by Ferguson (, p. ) as “the
linguistic diﬀerences that correlate with diﬀerent occasions of use”. This
means that acquisition of register involves gaining command of the range
of expressive options available in the target language, and being able to
map relevant linguistic forms in accordance with communicative context
(Biber, ). Moreover, register-sensitive usage is more aligned with the
displaced writing mode, which allows for more planning and monitoring,
hence more complex linguistic features (Halliday, ). Accordingly,
verbal passives occupied a prominent part of the elevated Hebrew register
in Ravid and Berman’s () analysis of text production across adolescence.

this background,

Hypotheses in the current study
Against
the current study was the ﬁrst systematic,
large-scale, dedicated study of Hebrew passive elicitation in sentential
context to engage school-going populations – children and adolescents –
compared with adults. The passivization task included two new variables
studied for the ﬁrst time, suitable for examining the language of literate
participants during the period of Later Language Development. First, the
variable of linguistic REGISTER, that is, language level. Register was used as
a measure of lexical speciﬁcity and degree of abstractness of the verb,
following the criteria established in Hebrew by Ravid and Berman ().
A second new variable was past versus future verb tense, as against all
previous experimental
studies on Hebrew passive production which
involved past tense, the default form of Hebrew passives.

We had four hypotheses following the literature reviewed above. ()
Correct performance on the passive task was expected to increase from the
youngest age group to adulthood, across the period of later language
development. () Sentences with active verbs in higher register were expected
to incur lower correct scores than those with verbs in neutral register. () We
expected Nif’al to lead correct passive performance, that is, to have the highest
scores starting from the lowest age group. We had no expectations regarding
the ordering within the two strict passives Pu’al and Huf’al, as previous
studies had shown conﬂicting results. () As an irrealis temporal form, future
tense is rarely used in referring to events. Accordingly, we expected higher
performance on the canonical past tense verbs.

This study was a structured elicitation task testing the production of Hebrew
passive voice constructions in writing. PARTICIPANTS were  typically

Measure (Strauss, ; Ensminger & Fothergill, ). All participants lived
in the same region in the south of Israel. Participants were in seven age/
schooling level groups:  eight- to nine-year-olds (M = ;) in third grade
(henceforth designated eight-year-olds);  nine- to ten-year-olds (M = ;) in
fourth grade;  ten- to eleven-year-olds (M = ;) in ﬁfth grade;  eleven-

olds (M = ;) in eighth grade;  sixteen- to seventeen-year-olds (M =
;) in eleventh grade; and  adult university students aged –.

Materials
Participants were asked to change written active-voice sentences into
corresponding passive-voice sentences. Materials consisted of  task
sentences divided according to three variables: verb register, binyan, and
verb tense (Table ).

eight-year-olds,

Register. Half of the sentences () were in neutral register, and the other
half in high register. Verbs with neutral register corresponded to Ravid and
Berman’s () level  – colloquial everyday usage, e.g. shalax ‘sent’ – while
high-register verbs corresponded to level  – the standard written usage of
lexically speciﬁc, abstract hexerim
educated monolingual speakers, e.g.
‘conﬁscated’. Task verbs were checked against school texts to ensure their
suitability for
age group. Sentential
arguments (agent and patient nouns) were adjusted to the verb’s register
level, based on Ravid’s () Noun Scale. For example, the agent and
patient for neutral-register send were Ron and letters respectively (Ron sent the
letters), while the agent and patient for high-register conﬁscate were the
Customs and merchandise respectively (the Customs conﬁscated the merchandise).
The register division was designed to determine whether lexical properties of
the active verb and its context were helpful or detrimental in learning. All
materials were piloted in a corresponding population to ensure that children
understood the meanings of the sentences and their components.

‘robbed / was robbed’), Pi’el (targeting passive Pu’al as in pizer/puzar
‘scattered / was scattered’), and Hif’il (Huf’al, as in yaklit/yuklat ‘will
record / will be recorded’). This division enabled us to test the role of
binyan morphology in learning to passivize.

Tense. Half of the task sentences had past tense verbs and half future tense
verbs. The most compelling reason for this was that present tense passive
forms (e.g. meluxlax ‘dirty’
in Pu’al) comprise an entirely diﬀerent
linguistic and psycholinguistic domain in Hebrew acquisition (Berman,
; Pe’er, ). Past and future tense verbs agree with their
grammatical subjects in person, gender, and number, while present tense
verbs carry gender and number (but no person) agreement marking, like
adjectives. The division into past and future verb tense enabled us to test
the role of the speciﬁc temporal patterns of each binyan in learning the
passive forms, and to ask whether past tense passives were easier to
acquire. All task verbs were in third person, e.g. ha-talmid te’er et ha-riv
‘the-student described ACC the-ﬁght’, so as to be narrative in tone.

Procedure
Testing took place in writing in the class forum, that is, during the school
day in the classroom. Participation was voluntary: students who did not
wish to participate were exempted and given other tasks in a diﬀerent
location on the school premises. Each student received one of
two
randomized versions of the target forty-eight sentences on two pages.
Students sitting next to each other received two diﬀerent versions to ensure
individual work. Each target sentence in active voice was followed by a
response
the
active-sentence object NP, which served as a prompt to the passive voice
construction that participants were asked to complete. For example,
ha-moxer yishkol et ha-sxora ‘the-vendor will-weigh the-merchandise’ was
followed by a line starting with ha-sxora ‘the merchandise’. Following
piloting,
the ﬁrst page was as follows:
“Following below are sentences. Re-write them without changing the
meaning of the sentence nor its tense.” Given the age range of the
participants, only one example was given: Yossi axal et ha-tapúax ‘Yossi ate
ACC the-apple’, followed by ha-tapúax ne’exal al yedey Yossi ‘The-apple was
eaten by Yossi’ (passive verb and by-phrase underlined in the given example).

As the patient grammatical subject was used as the prompt, syntactic errors
were virtually absent. Scoring thus focused on the morphological change
from active to passive verb. Responses were categorized into six levels

Level  indicated incorrect passive binyam responses, based on the correct
root, e.g. erroneous Huf’al hushdad for correct Nif’al nishdad ‘was
robbed’. For each of the three binyan patterns in the test, there were two
possible erroneous alternatives – the other two binyan patterns. Thus,
Nif’al or Pu’al passives were possible Level  errors for a target Huf’al
passive form. Level  involved two passive-related errors: () present-tense
resultative adjectives, e.g. mexudad ‘sharpened’ for target future tense
yexudad ‘will be
e.g.
erroneous hitkanes for target Nif’al niknas ‘was ﬁned’. Level  errors
consisted of morphophonologically non-felicitous forms with some passive
indication, such as u-vowels (e.g. tusuman for correct tesuman ‘will be
marked’). Level  errors consisted of non-passive responses, usually
focusing on the inﬂectionall markers of the cue active form. For example,
plural hegifu ‘they shuttered’ for hegifa ‘she shuttered’, where the target
passive form should have been hugfu ‘were shuttered’. Level  errors
consisted of non-passive semantic and syntactic alternatives (e.g. kibel knas
‘received a ﬁne’ for niknas ‘was ﬁned’), irrelevant answers, and empty slots.

This analysis yielded an eﬀect for register (F(,) = ·, p < ·,

verbs with high register (M = ·%). A four-way interaction of age/

(F(,) = ·, p < ·, η = ·), with subsequent two three-way and
three two-way interactions involving register. These results conﬁrmed our
initial hypothesis regarding the critical importance of linguistic register in
passivization. We thus turned to two separate analyses in neutral- and
high-register active/passive verbs.

Huf’al responses (M = ·%) were higher than Pu’al (M = ·%) and
Nif’al (M = ·%) responses, which did not diﬀer from each other.

and of binyan and verb tense (F = (,) = ·, p < ·, η = ·) were
found, as well as a three-way interaction of age group, binyan, and verb
tense (F(,) = ·, p < ·, η = ·). Figure  shows that future
tense Nif’al had the lowest scores in eight-year-olds and the shallowest
growth curve, while future tense Huf’al verbs and past tense Nif’al verbs
had the highest scores. Verbs in past tense Huf’al and both Pu’al tense
patterns were in the middle.

Further Bonferroni comparisons showed the same three clusters of age/

verb pattern (F(,) = ·,

comparisons showed that all three binyan patterns signiﬁcantly diﬀered
from each other: Huf’al responses (M = ·%) were highest, followed by
Pu’al (M = · %) and then Nif’al (M = ·%) responses. Verb tense
was not signiﬁcant.

Two two-way interactions of age group with binyan (F(,) = ·,

group, binyan, and verb tense (F(,) = ·, p < ·, η = ·).
Figure  shows two distinct groups of patterns in acquisition: the three
higher-scoring patterns were past tense Pu’al and the two Huf’al tense
patterns; the three lower-scoring patterns were past tense and future tense
Nif’al, and future-tense Pu’al.

Error analysis
Non-morphological errors were very few and did not permit statistical
analysis. They occurred only in eight- and nine-year-olds, and mostly
consisted of providing syntactic alternatives in the form of subordinated
clauses, e.g. ha-shulxan zaz biglal she-ha-mora heziza oto ‘the desk moved

Passive as a very late acquisition: development
Our ﬁrst two hypotheses regarding the protracted process of acquisition and
the impact of register were conﬁrmed. The current study found that learning
passive verb morphology in Hebrew is a very late acquisition. Active verbs in
neutral register with human subjects and concrete objects (e.g. tsava
‘painted’, tadpis ‘will type up’, pizer ‘scattered’) reached % correct
responses only by age thirteen to fourteen, almost a decade later than
attested in other languages with late passives. In our view, this delay is
mostly due to the drawn-out process of learning to reconcile the role of
Hebrew passives in the expression of event-oriented, dynamic and speciﬁc
(rather than concept-oriented, generic, and static) content, with using the
detached, distanced mode preferred by adult narrators (Berman, ;
Ravid & Chen-Djemal, ).

is

their ability to productively match verb forms

Passive learning in Hebrew demonstrates the interface of discourse
abilities with grammatical acquisition. While Hebrew-speaking eight-year-
olds have gained full and automatic command of verb morphology
(Berman, ),
to
discourse functions
just emerging (Berman, ). School-going
ten-year-olds use distinct grammatical devices for narrative and expository
agent demotion (Ravid, ), being familiar with the conventional
child-oriented medial passive and adjectival passive devices prevalent in
story-books (Ravid & Levie, ). Having encountered school texts, they
are also familiar with the use of subjectless, often verbless, constructions
for the expression of routines, ideas, and factual information (Berman,
; Ravid, ; Ravid & Zilberbuch, ). These two classes of
grammatical devices are, however, kept apart for distinct genre expression.
Learning verbal passives in Hebrew requires the ﬂexibility brought on
by adolescent socio-cognitive development (Blakemore & Choudhury, ;
Nippold, ), coupled with enhanced exposure to diverse communicative
events and written texts of diﬀerent genres (Berman & Ravid, ;
Christie & Derewianka, ). By late adolescence, these developments
enable Hebrew users to cross the strict genre–structure association and
adopt the mature preference for the specialized usage of event-oriented
verbal passives in taking a distanced, generic outlook on speciﬁc events.

Passive as a very late acquisition: register
As predicted, again, learning verbal passives was found to be mediated
by linguistic register. In the current study, abstract,
lexically speciﬁc,
higher-register active verbs (kansa ‘ﬁned’, tanxe ‘will lead the ceremony’,
nimek ‘motivated’) yielded lower passive scores than neutral verbs, and
reached % only by sixteen to seventeen years of age. Outside our
experimental design, high-register verbal passives are the norm rather than

the exception in Hebrew usage, and moreover they usually co-occur with
other abstract, mental, and irrealis high-register lexical items typical of
adult expression (Ravid & Chen-Djemal, ). This is exempliﬁed in (),
a  September  Hebrew posting on Facebook:

As register is a lexical feature in Hebrew (Ravid & Berman, ), verbal
passives are lexically rather than syntactically challenging. They are part of
the lexical explosion that doubles adolescent vocabulary, ushering in also
derived nominals (Ravid, ; Ravid & Avidor, ) and denominal
adjectives (Ravid & Zilberbuch, ), categories with restricted semantic–
pragmatic distributions and simpler alternatives used by younger speakers.

Learning the Hebrew passive: morphology and register
We now turn to the morphological aspects of passive acquisition. Recall the
remaining hypotheses regarding the primacy of Nif’al as the bridge to
passive learning, the indeterminate order of acquisition, and the challenge
posed by future tense passive forms. The ﬁndings revealed a clear, though
unexpected, order of acquisition among the three passive verb patterns,
interacting diﬀerently with temporal patterns, and introducing syntactic
and semantic considerations to the developmental picture.

Counter to previous ﬁndings, across development in both registers, and
particularly in the high register, past and future tense Huf’al verbs fared
the best in correct responses. Pu’al verbs followed; however, past was
easier than future tense, especially in the high register. Finally, Nif’al
verbs behaved diﬀerently in the two registers: future tense was extremely
challenging in both registers, but past tense Nif’al verbs were as easy as
Huf’al in neutral register, and as diﬃcult as future tense Nif’al in high
register. Moreover, target Nif’al verbs entailed four times as many passive
binyan errors than both the other passive patterns, with Huf’al occupying
all of Nif’al error space in neutral register, and all future tense Nif’al
error space in high register. Pu’al attracted almost all past tense Nif’al
errors. Explaining these results requires the examination of the properties
of each active/passive binyan pair, as mediated by the lexical properties of
register.

Huf’al passives. With the highest correct passive scores across all age
groups, and as the major attractor of passive binyan errors, Hebrew
learners clearly preferred Huf’al as the default verbal passive. This
highlights Hif’il/Huf’al as
semantically, and
phonologically regular and transparent active/passive pair in Hebrew. Of

the three active binyan patterns, Hif’il is the most transitive, with most
Hif’il verbs taking the accusative direct object (Dattner, ), hence
constituting the prototypical
syntactic source for passive formation.
Phonologically, too, Huf’al not only has the hallmark passive u-vowel, but
is also completely uniform, the only passive binyan with the same vocalic
pattern across all temporal stems. Semantically, Huf’al passives are the most
inﬂection-like in nature, solely dedicated to the regular, virtually automatic
passive modulation on the hif’il verb meaning. This is supported by a
recent analysis of Hebrew resultative adjectives in children’s peer talk,
which showed that the category of derivational, lexically speciﬁc Huf’al
adjectives was the smallest in the corpus (Pe’er, ).

Pu’al passives. Pu’al passives had an interim status in the study. In neutral
register, they lay in between the high-scoring Huf’al / past tense Nif’al and
the low-scoring future tense Nif’al. In high register, past tense Pu’al verbs
clustered with Huf’al, while future tense Pu’al verbs shared a steep
trajectory with Nif’al verbs. These results reﬂect the speciﬁc properties of
the Pi’el/Pu’al pair.

Syntactically, Pi’el is less transitive than Hif’il, with more oblique (rather
than accusative) objects (Dattner, ), and therefore fewer opportunities
for passive formation. Phonologically, although Pu’al shares the u-vowel
and the strict passive morphology with Huf’al, it is less uniform, absent
tense h-preﬁx. Morphologically, Pi’el and Pu’al are
the typical past
strongly linked to Hitpa’el (Ravid et al., ), oﬀering a medial-passive
escape hatch for the younger age groups: Thus, Pu’al had nine times as
many Level  medial-passive errors (%) than Nif’al and Huf’al (under
%) in the younger groups – all of them in Hitpa’el; for example, hitpazru
‘scattered’ for correct puzru ‘were scattered’, and yistakem ‘will add up to’
for correct yesukam ‘will be summarized’.

Taken together, these properties indicate the double function of Pi’el/
Pu’al as the less regular and transparent strict passive pair, side by side
with Pu’al’s central role as a derivational device, generating twice as many
resultative adjectives than the other two passive patterns, many of them
lacking transitive Pi’el sources (Pe’er, ). Pu’al was also revealed as the
canonical Hebrew perfective passive, accounting for the fact that past tense
Pu’al passives attracted the overwhelming majority Nif’al errors, and by
the inferior results of future tense Pu’al passives.

Nif’al passives. Counter our predictions, the Qal/Nif’al pair constituted
the major challenge to passive learning as the least preferred option for the
expression of passive voice in participants up to adulthood. Future tense
Nif’al verbs in neutral register and both tenses in high register had the

lowest scores in eight-year-olds, and distinctly steep trajectories. The maverick
morphophonological properties of Nif’al, so diﬀerent from the strict passives,
would have led us to posit a suitable hypothesis, but all previous studies on
Hebrew passive in acquisition had pointed at Nif’al as the bridge to passive
learning. Thanks to including the tense and register variables, the current
study can now oﬀer a solution to this apparent contradiction.

Clearly, passive voice is only one of the functions of Nif’al. It is the canonical
intransitive binyan in the Qal/Nif’al/Hif’il/Huf’al subsystem, holding a
similar role to Hitpa’el in the subsystem it shares with Pi’el and Pu’al (Ravid
et al., ). The relationship between Qal and Nif’al is often transitive/
middle, as in shavar/nishbar ‘break,TR/break,INT’, often with a simultaneous
interpretation of both middle or passive, as in tarak/nitrak ‘slam,TR/slam,
INT ∼ be slammed’. Many Nif’al middle/passives do not have Qal
counterparts, e.g. nirtav ‘get wet’, while others hold idiosyncratic
relationships with Qal, e.g. both avad/ne’evad meaning ‘get lost’ in high and
neutral
structurally and
semantically irregular and variegated binyan, is the least transitive of the
three passive-source binyanim, designated as transitivity-neutral in Berman
(). This is also supported in that half of the adjectival passives in
CaCuC, the passive resultative adjective pattern corresponding to the Qal
and Nif’al paradigm, do not match a transitive verb in Qal (Pe’er, ).

It was only the neutral register past tense Nif’al verbs, all conveying the
canonical perfective outlook, that had early high scores in the current
study, as in the previous studies, and served as the early bridge to mature
passives. Although most of
them had the double middle/passive
interpretation (e.g. neheras ‘be/get destroyed’, nishkal ‘be weighed / weigh
oneself’), there was no separate middle option attracting errors, as Hitpa’el
does for Pu’al. In other words, in a diﬀerent binyan they would have
shown Level  errors. But when required to use the non-canonical future
for the perfective outlook, these atypical Nif’al passives were rejected in
favor of the default Huf’al. The high-register abstract Nif’al passives, so
very diﬀerent from the early Nif’al telics such as nikra ‘tore’, were the last
to be acquired. They were abstract, clearly passive verbs (e.g. tibalem ‘will
be restrained’, niknesa ‘was ﬁned’), but nonetheless systematically rejected
by younger participants in favor of Huf’al (future tense) and Pu’al (past
tense) errors. For example, Huf’al tuvdak for correct Nif’al tibadek ‘will
be examined’, or Pu’al guzal for correct Nif’al nigzal ‘was usurped’. It was
only in late adolescence that participants were willing to forgo the strict
passive options and accept Nif’al as a passive option of Qal.

passive voice. Morphological passives ride piggyback on middle/passive past
tense Nif’al forms to begin with, but once the canonical Pu’al and Huf’al
passives are learned in grade school, the Nif’al bridge is burned. Hebrew
passive morphology enters the developmental picture only when learners
have identiﬁed how verbal passives behave in the speciﬁcally perfective yet
detached communicative contexts, where generic subjectless or adjectival
passives will not do the job – most typically, when conversant with the
literate, written mode.

Taking an overarching view of the domain, the study of passive voice
acquisition has undergone several phases, side by side with changes in the
construal of the passive voice in linguistics. Earlier studies viewed passive
voice (mainly through the prism of English) as a syntactic phenomenon,
with the delay to about age ﬁve explained by the need to move NPs in the
sentence (Borer & Wexler, ; Pierce, ), or due to a universal
maturational delay preventing children from connecting the patient role to
et al., ). Later,
the subject position (Horgan, ; Maratsos
input-driven analyses explained that English-speaking children under three
do not generalize the construction due to scarce exposure in early
childhood (Brooks & Tomasello, ). This view was supported by
typological studies pointing to the early acquisition of both simple and
complex forms of the passive in languages where passive constructions are
prevalent (Allen & Crago; Demuth, , ; Gil, ; Pye & Quixtan
Poz, ). The current study was chaperoned by the shifting linguistic
spotlight towards the verbal morphology of passives, on the one hand, and
the extension of developmental psycholinguistic investigation to the realms
of adolescence and written language, on the other.
