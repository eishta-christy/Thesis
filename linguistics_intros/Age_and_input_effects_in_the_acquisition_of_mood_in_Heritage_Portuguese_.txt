The present study analyzes the eﬀect of age and amount of input in the
acquisition of European Portuguese as a heritage language. An elicited
production task centred on mood choice in complement clauses was
applied to a group of ﬁfty bilingual children (six- to sixteen-year-olds)
who are acquiring Portuguese as a minority language in a German
dominant environment. The results show a signiﬁcant eﬀect of the age at
testing and the amount of input in the acquisition of the subjunctive. In
general, acquisition is delayed with respect to monolinguals, even though
higher convergence with the monolingual grammar is observed after
twelve years of age. Results also reveal that children with more exposure
to the heritage language at home show faster acquisition than children
from mixed households: the eight- to nine-year-old age boundary seems

year-old age boundary for those with less exposure.

I N T R O D U C T I O N
The acquisition of heritage languages, i.e. minority languages acquired in a
migration context, has been a matter of debate in recent literature. Heritage
speakers (HSs) acquire two (or more) languages in childhood and thus the
acquisition of a heritage language (HL) is an instance of bilingual acquisition.
HSs are either simultaneous bilinguals, if they are exposed to the minority
and the majority language from birth, or successive bilinguals, if contact with
the majority language occurs after extensive exposure to the family (heritage)
language. In either case, the age of onset of acquisition (AOA) of the HL is
similar to monolinguals. Nonetheless, a HL is deﬁned by becoming a
non-dominant language when the speakers start schooling and the amount of
input and continued language use radically decreases for the HL (Rothman,
). As a result, HSs’ linguistic performance became a fertile ground of
inquiry, namely allowing researchers to discuss to what extent the steady state
of linguistic knowledge ultimately attained by those speakers corresponds to
what is attained by monolingual speakers (see the discussion in Montrul,
; Rothman, ). When divergence between monolingual and HL
acquisition is identiﬁed, diﬀerent explanations have been put forward, namely
incomplete development or language attrition (Montrul, ; Polinsky,
), or explanations relating to the quality of the input (Pascual y Cabo &
Rothman, ; Pires & Rothman, ). Other studies highlight the nature
of the linguistic property under evaluation, with later-acquired structures
showing a more deﬁcient acquisition than early-acquired properties (Flores &
Barbosa, ; Santos & Flores, ). Later-acquired properties are
expected to be acquired at an age (school age) in which the child gets reduced
input from his/her HL, since the majority language is now the child’s
dominant language.

It is true, in general, that children vary in the amount of exposure that they
have to their ambient language(s). This has been shown to be the case not
only for children who grow up with two ambient languages, but also for L
input in typical monolingual acquisition settings across families and across
diﬀerent language communities (Hart & Risley, ; Hoﬀ, ; Hurtado,
Marchman & Fernald, ). Even innatism, which relativizes the role of
input
(e.g. Wexler, ), presupposes a
minimal amount of exposure to primary linguistic data in order to activate the
language acquisition device. There has to be a minimal threshold of exposure
responsible for triggering acquisition. Limited exposure below this supposed
baseline may trigger comprehension and perception skills, but not productive
ones, as seems to be the case with ‘overhearers’ (Au, Knightly, Jun & Oh,

). It has indeed been shown that restricted input to one language in
bilingual acquisition settings inﬂuences the development of lexical knowledge
(Bialystok & Luk, ; Hoﬀ & Naigles, ; Thordardottir, ),
pronunciation (Kupisch, Barton, Klaschik, Lein, Stangen & van de Weijer,
) and morphosyntactic knowledge (Gathercole & Thomas, ; Rodina
& Westergaard, ; Unsworth, Argyri, Cornips, Hulk, Sorace & Tsimpli,
). However, more studies are needed in order to determine to what extent
the quantity of input may limit the acquisition of diﬀerent areas of grammar.

Many studies showing input eﬀects in bilingual acquisition focus on early
successive bilinguals, and measure the eﬀects of length of exposure to the
target language, which interacts with the age of onset (see discussion in
Unsworth, ). In this paper, and by studying the acquisition of a HL,
we intend to evaluate the eﬀects of the amount of input, in an acquisition
setting in which the age of onset is similar to that of monolinguals. In this
case, we will evaluate the quantity of input through indirect measures
focused on children’s families, namely considering households with ﬁrst- or
second-generation parents and the existence of older siblings. Particularly,
we evaluate the eﬀect of the amount of input in the acquisition of mood
selection in complement clauses, a matter of semantics that interacts with
the lexicon (lexical semantics of the matrix verb) and syntax (of complement
clauses). The study is based on European Portuguese (EP) acquired as a
HL by children and adolescent speakers whose dominant language is German.
Most HL studies test adult HSs and therefore cannot distinguish eﬀects of
acquisition from eﬀects of subsequent language attrition. In this study, we
test individuals who are still acquiring the property at stake. Since use of
the subjunctive mood has been shown to stabilize late, we take into
account a large age span (six–sixteen years of age at the moment of testing)
and adopt a cross-sectional approach, which will allow us to infer a scale
of acquisition. HSs’ results will be compared to previous results from a
study on monolingual acquisition of the EP subjunctive (Jesus, ), in
terms of both the scale and the rate of acquisition (we will therefore look
at age). When discussing age, we will conﬁrm the relevancy of certain age
thresholds identiﬁed in preceding work on language acquisition and
language attrition. Additionally, we tested eight adult HSs, who represent
the ultimate attainment of HL acquisition.

The eﬀects of limited exposure to primary linguistic data have attracted
recent attention in the study of bilingual acquisition (see, e.g. Grüter &
Paradis, ). It has been suggested that restricted input to one language
in bilingual acquisition settings may inﬂuence the development of diﬀerent
linguistic domains, e.g. vocabulary size (Hoﬀ, Core, Place, Rumiche,

seems

Senor & Parra, ) or morphosyntactic development (Austin, ; Blom,
; Gathercole, ; Gathercole & Thomas, ; Hoﬀ et al., ;
Rodina & Westergaard, ; Schlyter, ; Suchtelen, ; Thomas,
Williams, Jones, Davies & Binks, ; Unsworth, ; Unsworth et al.,
; among many others). Schlyter () and Blom (), for instance,
claim that bilingual children with very unbalanced language input develop
a ‘weaker language’, displaying a slower rate of acquisition and structural
transfer from the stronger language. The stronger (ambient) language, on
the other hand,
to develop indistinguishably from that of
monolingual children of the same language background. As Meisel ()
points out, the hypothesis of a weaker language suggests that exposure
since birth is a necessary but not suﬃcient condition for native-like
language acquisition. This seems to suggest that suﬃcient exposure to the
primary linguistic data must happen at the appropriate age in order to be
successful. Several studies argue in favour of this idea. Gathercole (),
Gathercole and Thomas (), and Thomas et al. (), for instance,
show that the grammatical development of the minority language (Welsh, in
their case) depends on the amount of exposure to this language at home and
in school. Several other studies, which include parental
input as an
extralinguistic variable, reach similar conclusions (e.g. Rodina & Westergard,
; Suchtelen, ). Rodina and Westergard (), who analyze the
acquisition of gender, show that Norwegian–Russian bilingual children from
households where the two parents speak the minority language, Russian,
outperform bilingual children from mixed households, who have less
exposure to Russian.

Nevertheless, many studies which stress the role of the amount of input in
the development of the minority language show that diﬀerences found at
earlier ages are overcome at later ages in some domains (Gathercole, ;
Gathercole, Thomas, Roberts, Hughes & Hughes, ; Paradis, Tremblay
& Crago, ; Unsworth, ). Consequently, they suggest that bilingual
children may take longer to acquire certain structures of their weaker
language, but they tend to reach native-like competence, even if at an older
age, and follow the same acquisition path. This observation shows that
input diﬀerences mainly aﬀect the rate of acquisition but not its outcome
(see also Meisel, ). This is strengthened by studies that include older
children or adults (Gathercole et al., ). As an explanation for this
protracted, yet native-like development, it has been suggested that children
who have restricted input
to one language may take more time to
accumulate positive evidence (Gathercole, ; Gathercole & Thomas,
). Consequently, they will need more time to accumulate this evidence
if they have less exposure to the target language (see also the concept of
‘cumulative’ exposure, suggested by Unsworth, ).

A C Q U I S I T I O N O F H E R I T A G E P O R T U G U E S E

However, not all linguistic domains seem to be similarly aﬀected by
reduced input. Input eﬀects have been shown with respect
to the
acquisition of grammatical structures that present opaque form–function
mappings, such as the gender system and plural morphology in Welsh
(Thomas & Gathercole, ; Thomas et al., ) or the gender system
in Dutch or Russian (Blom, Polišenskà & Unsworth, ; Cornips &
Hulk, ; Polinsky, ; Rodina & Westergaard, ; Unsworth, ).
Also, structures that are syntactically very complex and/or are known to
stabilize late in monolingual acquisition are good candidates for delayed
acquisition in bilingual and, particularly, HL acquisition. This is the case
of clitic placement in EP (Flores & Barbosa, ), or structures which
only occur in formal varieties of the target language, as described by
Meisel, Elsig, and Bonnesen () for certain French interrogatives.
According to Tsimpli (), late acquisition is expected in general in the
case of all non-core linguistic phenomena, which are related to language‐
external resources (such as working memory) or to interface phenomena.
In the case of these phenomena, Tsimpli’s prediction is that acquisition by
bilingual subjects is determined only by input and not by age of onset.
What is essential for us is that timing in L development of the analyzed
properties may be a further variable that has to be taken into account in
studies on input eﬀects in bilingualism. It seems that structures which are
acquired late in monolingual acquisition, due either to their complexity,
interface nature, or absence in colloquial varieties, may show an even more
protracted development in bilinguals’ weaker language. Consequently, the
division per se into early, late, and very late phenomena is very useful for
us, if we relate the nature of the grammatical property with the amount of
input together with maturational constraints, therefore not considering the
factors in isolation (see Long & Rothman’s, , comments).

As for the interaction between the quantity of input and the type of
property under analysis, if we assume that there are sensitive periods for
the acquisition of diﬀerent language domains (Meisel, ), we can
suggest that insuﬃcient exposure during the optimal phase of acquisition
could indeed lead to an acquisition delay (or even failure). In the case of
late (or very late) properties, and in cases of reduced exposure at a later
age, which happens with the HL child, the input the child receives during
the relevant period may not be suﬃcient and, consequently, this delays its
stabilization. It has been suggested that in these cases bilingual children
may not catch up and do not reach native-like knowledge in these domains
(Thomas et al., ). The present study aims precisely at analyzing the
eﬀects of reduced input in the bilingual acquisition of a property, the
distribution of the subjunctive mood in European Portuguese complement
clauses, which stabilizes
in monolingual
acquisition. In the next section, we summarize relevant facts concerning

mood contrasts in EP complement clauses and its acquisition. Since our
subjects are HSs of EP living in Germany, we also summarize relevant
facts concerning the distribution of mood in German.

M O O D I N E P A N D G E R M A N
Distribution of indicative and subjunctive moods in EP
Portuguese verbal morphology shows diﬀerent moods, the main ones being
the indicative and the subjunctive. The selection of one or another mood in
complement clauses is basically constrained by the meaning of the matrix
predicate, though with some verb classes factors such as negation or the
tense of the main clause may interfere with the selection of mood for
complement clauses (see, e.g. Marques, ).

In EP, the indicative is selected for complement clauses introduced by the

following verb classes:

()

a. Strong epistemic verbs (which express knowledge or a high degree of

belief), such as saber ‘know’ or pensar ‘think’

b. Declarative verbs, such as dizer ‘say’
c. Commissive verbs, such as prometer ‘promise’
d. Fiction verbs, such as sonhar ‘dream’

On the other hand, the subjunctive is selected by verbs like the ones listed
below:

()

a. Non-epistemic implicative verbs (including verbs such as deixar ‘let’
or conseguir ‘manage’, and evaluative predicates, such as lamentar
‘regret’ or achar bem ‘approve’)

b. Non-epistemic non-implicative verbs (including verbs of volition,

such as querer ‘want’ and directive verbs, such as mandar ‘order’)

c. Weak epistemic verbs (which express a negative belief or a low

degree of belief, such as duvidar ‘doubt’)

Concerning (), it should be said that in Karttunen () implicative verbs
are those that allow the inference that the embedded proposition is true in
aﬃrmative sentences, but do not allow such inference in negative
sentences; here, the term is broadly used to refer to this kind of verbs plus
factive verbs, i.e. those whose complement proposition is taken to be true
regardless of the truth value of the main proposition. Apart from the verbs
mentioned in (), there is a group of verbs that in EP accepts both moods
in the complement clause. This is the case of acreditar ‘to believe’ and a
group of other verbs with the same core meaning.

Diﬀerent analyses have been suggested concerning the distinctions of
mood in the adult’s grammar. Here, we accept the account of Marques
(), which is based on EP data. This author proposes that two main

A C Q U I S I T I O N O F H E R I T A G E P O R T U G U E S E

semantic factors intervene in the mood system of EP: epistemicity (the
attitude expressed towards the proposition is one of knowledge or belief)
and veridicality (as deﬁned in Giannakidou, ). According to
Giannakidou’s concept of veridicality, a propositional operator is veridical
if the proposition it introduces is taken to be true by some entity in the
relevant model, which corresponds to a set of possible worlds. For
instance, factive verbs, such as to know or to regret, are veridical operators,
since their complement clauses are taken to be true by the speaker and the
(entity referred to by the) subject of the main clause. Similarly, verbs like
to think and to dream are also veridical operators, since their complement
clauses are taken to be true in the worlds that correspond respectively to
the beliefs and to the dreams of the main clause’s subject.

The fact that a context is veridical does not mean that an epistemic
propositional attitude is being openly expressed. For instance, some factive
verbs, like regret, are veridical, but they are not epistemic. They do not
primarily express an attitude of belief, but rather another kind of attitude,
that we might call ‘evaluative’ (see Palmer, , amongst others).

Marques () argues that in EP all the verbs that select an indicative
complement express an attitude of knowledge or POSITIVE belief (i.e. they
are veridical operators associated with epistemic modality). This is clearly
the case of the verbs in (a), and also the case of declarative (b) and
commissive (c) verbs: these verbs also express an attitude of belief,
committing the subject of the main clause to the truth of the embedded
proposition. With ﬁction verbs (d), Marques claims that they are also
epistemic predicates, with the particularity of the belief being relativized
to the relevant model, e.g. the dream world in the case of to dream (see
Farkas, ; Giannakidou, , ; a.o.).

As for the verbs that select the subjunctive, most of them (a, b) do not
express a propositional attitude of epistemic nature, but rather express
diﬀerent kinds of attitude (they are associated with, e.g. volition modality,
deontic modality, evaluative modality). The only kind of verbs that select
the subjunctive and express an epistemic attitude are the equivalent of to
doubt and verbs (e.g. acreditar ‘believe’) which in EP allow both the
indicative
the
subjunctive being selected when a low degree of belief is expressed.

complement

and the

in their

clauses,

Notice, however, that the subjunctive occurs in non-veridical contexts as
in fact, some of the verbs
well as in veridical non-epistemic contexts:
selecting the subjunctive are non-veridical
(b, c), whilst others are
veridical (a). Therefore, contrary to what happens in other languages,
such as Modern Greek (see, e.g. Giannakidou, ), one cannot say that
the selection of the subjunctive in EP is driven by non-veridicality alone.
Also, one cannot say that the expression of an epistemic attitude is enough
for the selection of the indicative in EP. The subjunctive also occurs in

epistemic contexts if they are non-veridical (the case of c). Thus, according
to Marques’ () proposal, the indicative is selected if an epistemic
veridical attitude is expressed towards the proposition, the subjunctive
being selected for all other cases (i.e. the subjunctive is linked to the
expression of both non-epistemic and epistemic non-veridical attitudes).

Therefore, the distribution of mood in EP, which was presented in () and
(), can be summarized as in Table , where matrix predicates are organized
according to the features [±epistemic] and [±veridical]. In this case, the
category of strong epistemic verbs includes both verbs that express an
attitude of knowledge or belief and other verbs, namely declarative and
commissive verbs, which may also be taken to express an epistemic
propositional attitude. Fiction verbs can be said to equally express a strong
epistemic propositional attitude, being also [+epistemic; +veridical], but
they are kept in the table in a separate category, since in this case the
belief must be relativized to a model that is an alternative to (the main
clause’s subject view of) reality (e.g. the model corresponding to the
dream, in the case of the verb to dream).

Previous results on the acquisition of mood contrasts in EP
Accepting the analysis of mood detailed above, Jesus () investigated the
acquisition of the distribution of the subjunctive by EP monolingual
speakers. In this study, an elicited production task was applied to eighty
children, aged four to nine, and a control group of twenty adults. The test
consisted of a sentence completion task presenting complement clauses
which were introduced by verbs pertaining to the classes mentioned above
(see previous section). A summary of the results is presented in Table .

either under

The results conﬁrm that the adults follow the pattern predicted by
Marques’ () proposal (see previous section), selecting the subjunctive
in [−epistemic]
([+veridical]) or
non-implicative ([−veridical]) predicates and in [+epistemic; −veridical], i.
e. under weak epistemic predicates. Conversely, they select the indicative
in [+epistemic; +veridical] contexts – in this case, the matrix verbs used in
the task were strong epistemic and ﬁction verbs (tested separately). The
adult accuracy rate ranged from ·% to % across all conditions, with
the exception of DMC (double mood choice), in which they obtained only
·%. This lower rate is explained by the fact that double mood choice
epistemic items ([+epistemic; ±veridical]) present cases in which mood
selection is also dependent on the discourse context and may vary
according to the speaker’s interpretation of the given situation.

Regarding the child data, the results suggest that, between the ages of ﬁve
and nine, children may already be dealing with some semantic values that are
relevant for the EP mood system. Overall, the children showed a preference

for the indicative on [+epistemic; +veridical] contexts, both with strong
epistemic and ﬁction verbs and, even if presenting lower rates,
the
subjunctive was used rather systematically in [−epistemic],
i.e. under
implicative and non-implicative matrix predicates. At the age of eight and
nine, target-like performance is observed within these conditions: % of
accuracy with implicative verbs and % with non-implicative.

later in acquisition (see the contrast of

Nevertheless, some critical areas were found. As for the subjunctive
conditions, the data revealed a distinction between children’s performance
with weak epistemic predicates ([+epistemic; −veridical]) vs. implicative
and non-implicative predicates ([−epistemic]), the former remaining more
problematic until
the scores
achieved by the eight- to nine-year-olds in [–epistemic] contexts vs.
[+epistemic; –veridical] contexts). Hence,
the indicative seems to be
associated with [+epistemic] contexts and the subjunctive with [−epistemic]
indicative production in [+epistemic;
contexts, resulting in non-target
−veridical] contexts,
i.e. under weak epistemic predicates. However,
target-deviant answers in subjunctive conditions do not correspond only to
indicative productions. Some inﬁnitive uses were observed, especially in the
younger children. The most expressive use of the inﬁnitive was found within
[−epistemic] conditions: four-year-olds produced ·% of inﬁnitives with
both implicative and non-implicative predicates. Nevertheless, at the age of
ﬁve, this percentage decreases to % with implicative verbs and ·% with
non-implicative verbs. Although the inﬁnitive responses are residual, they can
be understood in the light of the SEMANTIC OPPOSITION HYPOTHESIS (Hyams,
), which suggests that, from an early age, children may use the inﬁnitive
to encode modal distinctions. Alternatively,
they may indicate some
diﬃculties with subjunctive morphology (see Jesus, , for discussion).

As

for the contexts where the indicative was the expected mood
([+epistemic; +veridical]), children in all age groups preferred the indicative
in all the expected contexts tested, i.e. with both strong epistemic and
ﬁction verbs, as already mentioned. However, their performance was worse
with ﬁction verbs, and they surprisingly employed some subjunctive forms
in these contexts: in the case of four-year-old children, the accuracy rate
with strong epistemic verbs was ·%, whereas with ﬁction verbs it was
only ·%, and, at the ages of six and seven, when children already show a
target-like performance with strong epistemic verbs (producing % of
indicatives), they still produce some subjunctives with ﬁction verbs (having
·% accurate answers). This was
() as
suggesting that at some point in development children take the REALIS/
IRREALIS opposition as interacting with the distribution of the subjunctive:
the complement of a ﬁction verb is interpreted as an irrealis context.
Indeed,
the
subjunctive may to some extent be associated with the irrealis.

Based on these results, Jesus () argues that younger children show
greater sensitivity to the epistemic value, ﬁrst associating the subjunctive
with [−epistemic] contexts and the indicative with [+epistemic] contexts.
As they develop,
they become more sensitive to veridicality (when
combined with epistemicity), being able to use the subjunctive with weak
epistemic predicates. In more general terms, this study has also shown that
mood in complement clauses is a late-acquired phenomenon, since even
eight- and nine-year-olds do not absolutely demonstrate target behaviour.

Mood in German complement clauses
Diﬀering from EP and other Romance languages, in German the selection of
mood in complement clauses is not primarily constrained by the meaning of
the matrix predicate (Meinunger, ). Whereas in Romance languages, in
many contexts,
the subjunctive is obligatory in certain
complement clauses and cannot be replaced by the indicative, in German
the indicative mood can be used with all classes of matrix predicates (see
() for the use of the indicative with a volition verb, which is not possible
in EP).

the use of

()

Ich wollte, dass sie kommt.
I wanted that she cameIND.
‘I wanted her to come.’

Even though German grammars formally distinguish between the present
subjunctive, called KONJUNKTIV I, and the past
subjunctive, called
KONJUKTIV II, there is no clear temporal opposition between the present
and past subjunctive. Instead, there are diﬀerent modal, discursive, and
socio-stylistic distributions of both forms (Fabricius-Hansen & Sæbø,
; Zifonun, Hoﬀmann, & Strecker, ). Primarily,
the present
subjunctive, also known as the ‘reportive subjunctive’, signals that the
proposition is the object of an utterance report (Fabricius-Hansen &
Sæbø, ). According to traditional grammars, the past subjunctive may
also be used to express irrealis (e.g. Flämig, ). However, the past and
present subjunctives are often interchangeable.

Since we will not test German, we will not go into detail describing the
German subjunctive. What is relevant for the present study is that the
German Konjunktiv-forms do not encode the type of semantic values
encoded by the subjunctive in Portuguese, Romance languages in general,
and in some other languages (such as Greek). Therefore, if one thinks that
some languages morphologically encode veridicality (e.g. Greek) or both
epistemicity and veridicality (e.g. EP), or even a realis/irrealis opposition,
the child’s task must be to determine whether the particular language s/he
is acquiring encodes these particular features (which may be conceived as

ﬁxing a semantic parameter or mapping morphology with particular
features). The distribution of the morphological forms corresponding to
the Konjunktiv in German is not determined by the same features.

Additionally, it may be important to highlight that the morphological
subjunctive is acquired very late in L German (Knobloch, ), and it
is rare in spoken, colloquial registers, where it is substituted by the
periphrastic form ‘würde + inﬁnitive’.

M E T H O D
In this section we present the study, deﬁning the set of participants
(bilingual HSs of EP living in Germany) and presenting the method used
for testing the participants, which consisted of applying to this group of
HSs the same experiment applied by Jesus () to monolingual speakers
of EP. We also state our research questions, deﬁning particular predictions.
As stated in the ‘Introduction’, we will be generally interested in comparing
monolingual and bilingual acquisition, in terms of both the scale and the
rate of acquisition, with a particular interest in determining the eﬀects of
variables relating to the amount of input in the rate of acquisition.

Participants
The participants are ﬁfty children/adolescents from Portuguese-speaking
families with an immigration background, who were all resident in Germany
(in the city of Hamburg) at the time of testing. In addition, eight adult HSs
living in the same region were also tested. All participants grew up bilingually
with Portuguese as their home language and German as the majority language.
The young participants (six- to sixteen-year-olds; mean age = ·; SD = ·)
were grouped according to four age intervals: six to seven-year-olds, eight- to
nine-year-olds, ten- to twelve-year-olds, and thirteen- to sixteen-year-olds. The
two youngest age groups are age-matched with the two oldest monolingual
child groups (six–seven years; eight–nine years)
tested in Jesus ().
Additionally, we decided to distinguish between ten- to twelve-year-olds and
adolescents older than twelve years of age, since the age span around twelve
years of age is shown to be a crucial time for language development (Bylund,
; Flores, ). Table  presents the exact number of children per age and
their categorization per age group (with mean age and standard deviation (SD)).
Information concerning children’s biography and patterns of language
exposure were collected using a background questionnaire which included
questions about the languages spoken at home with parents and siblings or
other family members, the parents’ migration background, schooling, and
sources of contact with Portuguese (e.g. holidays spent in Portugal).
Forty-eight out of ﬁfty children were born in Germany; two participants
emigrated from Portugal at the age of two. All children were exposed to

Portuguese since birth and to German from the age of three or four, when
they started attending a German-speaking kindergarten. When asked about
their language preferences, all participants claimed to feel much more
comfortable speaking German, but
they spoke
Portuguese in their daily life. All children attended the HL programme
for children with Portuguese backgrounds, sponsored by the Portuguese
government, two hours per week (where they were recruited) from the ﬁrst
year on (i.e.  to  years of schooling in the HL; mean time of attendance
of the HL course =  years; SD = ·). The children’s families belong to
the lower-middle class. All parents have a basic or secondary school level
of education; no parent has a university degree.

they also stated that

Despite the fact that all participants grew up bilingually, the amount of
daily contact with Portuguese varied across the group depending on the
migration background of
their parents. All children with two ﬁrst
generation parents (in this case, parents immigrated to Germany as adults
and learned German as a second language) spoke mainly Portuguese at
home. Their ﬁrst intensive contact with German occurred when they
entered kindergarten at
three to four years, being early
successive bilinguals with Portuguese as L and German as L. In
contrast, those children who had at least one bilingual parent, who grew
up and attended school in Germany, used both languages at home. In
these cases, German has an important role in family interaction, exclusive
communication in Portuguese often being relegated to contact with
grandparents or aunts and uncles, or holidays spent in Portugal. These
children are simultaneous bilinguals who were exposed to Portuguese and
German from birth. It should be noticed that no child has a parent who
speaks only German. All the children included in the study had parents
who were either ﬁrst-generation or second-generation immigrants. In
addition, children with a Portuguese migration background, but who lived
in exclusively German-speaking households, were excluded from this study.
Based on the migration background of their parents, we have a group of
twenty-four children growing up in dominant Portuguese households
(‘Gparents’) and a group of twenty-six children from mixed German–
Portuguese households (‘Gparents’). In addition, these children could
also be split according to the presence of older siblings in the family.
Table  synthetizes the information concerning the families’ proﬁles.

Obviously it is diﬃcult to quantify the exact amount of input each
participant receives, but it is reasonable to assume that children who are
growing up in Portuguese–German households have signiﬁcantly less
exposure to their HL than children whose HL is the dominant language
spoken at home, even though both groups are exposed to Portuguese from
birth. In the case of children from Portuguese households, there is a more
balanced use of the minority (inside home) and the majority (outside

home) language, while in the former group the majority language is present
inside and outside the family, reducing the amount of exposure to the
minority/HL.

In order to complement input measures, the existence of older siblings was also
considered in the present study. Many parents who have at least two bilingual
children often report that their older child tends to have better proﬁciency in
the family language than their younger children (Barron-Hauwaert, ).
These subjective reports are conﬁrmed by studies which focus on language use
within bilingual families (Hoﬀ, Welsh, Place & Ribot, ; Shin, ).
Having surveyed over  Korean heritage families living in the US, Shin
() documents an accentuated shift towards the dominant language in
language choice from the ﬁrst-born to the last-born child. It is very common
that, even in households where the parents mainly speak the minority language,
the main language of communication among siblings is the majority language.
Consequently, second-born children tend to acquire the majority language at a
younger age than their older brother or sister, and use it more frequently earlier.
In this study, twenty-four participants are ﬁrst-born and twenty-six are second-
or third-born children (see Table ). In two cases both siblings were tested.

Additionally, we tested a group of eight adult heritage speakers of EP, with
ages ranging from nineteen to thirty-seven years (mean = ·; SD = ·). All
speakers were born in Germany as second-generation migrants and grew up
bilingually speaking Portuguese at home (and in an extracurricular HL
course) and German outside. The linguistic proﬁle of this adult group
mirrors the proﬁle of the child group with ﬁrst-generation parents, and
allows inferences concerning the steady state of
language knowledge
attained by HSs with similar linguistic proﬁles.

Procedure
Given that one of the main goals of this study is to compare the acquisition paths of
both heritage speakers and monolinguals, we applied the experiment designed by
Jesus (), which tested the selection of mood by EP monolinguals.

In this test, children were told a set of four little illustrated stories, which
included diﬀerent test items associated with diﬀerent episodes in the stories.
After hearing each episode in the story, the participants were asked to help

made sure that, while responding to the task, children were shown an
image that exhibited the relevant content for their answer. Despite that
fact, the complement proposition was always represented as an open
possibility, and never as a fact or an impossible event. This allowed us to
control the eﬀect of some semantic notions that may play a role in mood
systems (as realis/irrealis or (non-)veridicality). As an example, see the

The verbs for the matrix clause were chosen in accordance with the
semantic notions shown in Table . In this case, six test conditions were
considered, corresponding to diﬀerent semantic contexts, and for each
condition, two diﬀerent verbs were selected (see Table , where we present
the diﬀerent conditions and the matrix predicates selected for each
condition).
Three conditions (A, B, and C in Table ) elicited subjunctive complement
clauses: the condition corresponding to [−epistemic; +veridical] contexts (i.e.
complements to non-epistemic implicative verbs); to [−epistemic; −veridical]
contexts, i.e. complements to non-epistemic non-implicative verbs; and to
[+epistemic; −veridical] contexts,
to so-called weak
epistemic verbs.

i.e. complements

Two conditions elicited indicative complement clauses (conditions E and
F in Table ), both corresponding to [+epistemic; +veridical] contexts.
However, these contexts have been split into two conditions, speciﬁcally
strong epistemic and ﬁction verbs. Fiction verbs raise the issue of irrealis,
which, according to Jesus (), may play a role in the distribution of the
subjunctive in child speech.

In addition, another condition tested mood choice in the complement of
an epistemic DOUBLE MOOD CHOICE verb – acreditar ‘believe’ (condition D
in Table ). In such cases, the selection of mood is not exclusively
dependent on the matrix verb, but also depends on elements in the discourse
context. More precisely, the context is suggestive of whether the relevant
entity has a high or a low degree of belief in the truth of the complement
proposition. Hence, two items were used in contexts where the indicative was
expected and other two items were used in contexts where the subjunctive
was expected.

The test contained a total of thirty-eight items ( training items,  test
items –  for each verb – and  ﬁllers). No more items could be included
due to young children’s reduced attention span.

The test was applied to each subject in a single session, and all sessions
were recorded and transcribed. The interviewer was presented to the
participants as a visiting researcher
from Portugal who spoke only
Portuguese, so that only Portuguese was spoken during data collection.
The data were coded according to mood selection, i.e. the child either
produced the INDICATIVE or the SUBJUNCTIVE. Additionally, sometimes
children used the INFINITIVE. This was coded as a third answer type.
Missing responses, answers that revealed a misunderstanding of the story
or of the matrix verb or where the child did not produce a complement
clause, were coded as ‘NA’ and excluded from the statistical analysis. A
total of forty-seven tokens (out of ,) were excluded, mostly because
the child complemented the sentence with elements other
than a
complement clause (e.g. only a determiner phrase) or did not provide an

answer. Nineteen (out of  excluded tokens) revealed a misunderstanding of
the matrix verb; especially the verbs duvidar ‘to doubt’ and ﬁngir ‘to pretend’
(literally, ‘to fake’) were unknown to some children. This low rate of answers
excluded due to misunderstanding of the verb (·% of all tokens) shows
that, in general, lack of knowledge of the verb was not a main obstacle to
performing the task.

Research questions and predictions
This study addresses two main research questions. The ﬁrst one is presented
below.

I. Is the acquisition of the distribution of mood in complement clauses by

HSs similar to what is described for monolingual speakers?

If it is similar, we can make the following predictions, based on the previous
results obtained for EP by Jesus ():

a. HSs will not show problems in using the indicative mood from the age
span of six to seven years, showing performance at
the level of
monolinguals either in the Strong Epistemic (E.) or in the Fiction (F.)
conditions.

b. As for the subjunctive conditions, ceiling or near target-like performance
is expected from the age span of six to seven years in the Implicative (A.)
and in the Non-implicative (B.) conditions. In the Weak epistemic
condition (C.), non-target performance is expected later (at least at
eight to nine years), but convergent development is expected in the
older groups of HSs (ten to twelve years; thirteen to sixteen years, and
adults) in all subjunctive conditions.

If HSs deviate from monolingual children, this divergence may take two
diﬀerent forms:

Diﬀerences may be quantitative (only) and aﬀect the rate of acquisition
(and eventually ultimate attainment), but not the course of acquisition.
This means that HSs will acquire the distribution of the indicative and
the subjunctive in the diﬀerent contexts
in the same order as
monolingual children, but possibly later. We would therefore expect:

c. an asymmetry between the acquisition of

the indicative and the
subjunctive mood, with HSs ﬁrst achieving convergent performance in
indicative contexts (although better performance may be expected
earlier with Strong Epistemic verbs rather than with Fiction verbs).
d. in the subjunctive conditions, better performance will be achieved in
conditions corresponding to [−epistemic] contexts (A. Implicative and
B. Non-implicative) rather than in the Weak Epistemic condition (C.),

with even better performance expected in the case of the Non-implicative
(B.).

As opposed to this, diﬀerences may also be qualitative, i.e. the HL child may
show an acquisition path that completely diverges from monolinguals. This
may be the case if:

e. HSs do not show the indicative–subjunctive asymmetry found in
monolinguals, or if HSs do not demonstrate a preference for the
subjunctive in non-epistemic contexts and for
the indicative in
epistemic ones.

The second research question we want to answer concerns the relationship
between the amount of input and acquisition:

II. Is the rate of acquisition predicted by the amount of input received by

the children?

(with second-generation parents) will

In this case, child HSs will acquire the distribution of mood later than
monolingual children, but more importantly, children with less input at
home
show target-like use
(especially) of the subjunctive later than children with more input at
home. Birth order may further inﬂuence the speed of acquisition, with
ﬁrst-born children showing higher
target-like answers than
children with older siblings.

rates of

If this is conﬁrmed, we expect that:

f. children with ﬁrst-generation parents will attain target-like (or near
target-like) performance earlier than children with second-generation
parents;

g. ﬁrst-born children will attain target-like (or near target-like) performance

earlier than non-ﬁrst-born children.

R E S U L T S
We start by descriptively presenting our results in terms of accuracy rates by
group and by condition (see Table ). Only after this general description will
we present the results of the statistical analysis.

Table  shows a general convergence between HSs and the monolinguals’
performance, as analyzed by Jesus (),
that both
monolingual and HL children were more successful earlier in indicative
than in subjunctive contexts. Also, in a way similar to the monolinguals,
in the indicative conditions all child HSs showed higher rates of accuracy
with strong epistemic verbs (Condition E.) than in contexts with ﬁction
verbs (Condition F.), and higher rates of target subjunctive in [–epistemic]

However, and despite what seems a sign of general convergence in terms of
the acquisition path, HSs showed delayed development when compared with
monolingual children. In the case of the indicative conditions, convergence
with monolinguals was already found in the group of six- to seven-year-
olds. However, the accuracy rate was not as high as in the case of
monolingual children of the same age. In the case of the subjunctive
conditions, the results were more striking: HSs converged with the target
grammar only in the thirteen- to sixteen-year-old age span, with all
younger groups showing performance below %; in addition, the accuracy
rates achieved by the HSs in the thirteen-to sixteen-year-old group were
only comparable to the accuracy rates of monolingual children in the age
span of six to seven years old. Adult HSs showed high accuracy rates
(with the exception of condition D. – DMC contexts, exactly as in the case
of monolingual adults), although generally performing at a slightly lower
level, especially in the indicative conditions – we will come back to this.

Therefore, this ﬁrst analysis of the results showed that data were generally
consistent with predictions c. and d. (we will come back to this when
discussing the statistical results), but not with predictions a. and b. This
means that child HSs generally follow the same acquisition path as
monolingual children and, given the results obtained by adult HSs,
ultimately converge with the target grammar, but their acquisition is
generally delayed, i.e. it does not happen within the same age span as in
the case of monolingual speakers.

Complementing the results shown in Table , Figures  and  (provided
as supplementary materials; online <www.journals.cambridge.org/JCL>)

they did not give the target answer, allowing an evaluation of whether an

conditions requiring an indicative complement, the youngest children had
already acquired ﬁniteness and produced the indicative in a target-like
manner in more than % of all contexts.

Nevertheless, with ﬁction verbs, HSs sometimes selected the subjunctive
mood, a tendency which was more salient in the case of the oldest children
and the adults (·% and ·%, respectively).

Diﬀerent results were obtained in the three conditions requiring the
subjunctive (see Figure  in the online supplementary materials). In this
condition, all child groups resorted primarily to the indicative mood when
they did not produce the subjunctive. Additionally,
there was also,
however, a much more salient use of the inﬁnitive in these contexts. The

and ·% (Non-implicative condition) of non-ﬁnite forms. Only the adult
HSs never used inﬁnitives in ﬁnite contexts.

The second research question, which is central to the goals of this paper,
concerns the eﬀects of the amount of input in bilingual (HL) acquisition. In
order to answer this question, we performed a statistical analysis, which
allowed us to test not only the eﬀect of age at testing but also the eﬀect of
factors relating to the amount of input in the acquisition of mood choice
in complement clauses. We thus performed a Generalized Linear Mixed
Model (GLMM), using Rbrul, a text-based interface to existing functions
in the R environment (Johnson, ). Statistical results are reported in
the log-odds scale (the odds is the ratio of the probability of an event
happening to that of it not happening; the log-odds is the logarithm of the
odds) and degree of signiﬁcance (p) of predictor variables.

Two complementary analyses were performed. In a ﬁrst analysis, focused
on the overall performance of the children and its correlation with age at
testing and input factors, we tested the ﬁxed eﬀects CONDITION, AGE GROUPS,
and the two factors which we take as indirect measures of quantity of input,
PARENTS (ﬁrst- vs. second-generation parents) and SIBLINGS (presence or
absence of older siblings), together with SUBJECT as a random factor. In a
second analysis, aimed at determining developmental eﬀects in particular
conditions, especially those conditions identiﬁed as problematic, according
to the description of raw performance data, we performed GLMM per
condition and evaluated the eﬀects of AGE GROUPS, PARENTS, and SIBLINGS,
also maintaining SUBJECT as a random factor.

The ﬁrst analysis revealed signiﬁcant eﬀects of all predictor variables:
CONDITION (p < ·), AGE (p < ·), SIBLINGS (p = ·), and PARENTS
(p = ·). Table  indicates the log-odds values and overall accuracy rate
for each selected variable.

Concerning the variable CONDITION, the results revealed that the rate of
accuracy was considerably higher in the indicative than in the subjunctive
contexts, the strong epistemic condition being the most unproblematic
one, with a positive log-odds value of ·, followed by the ﬁction verb
condition, with a positive log-odds value of ·. This is in agreement
with prediction c. In contrast, the subjunctive contexts and the context of
DMC showed lower rates of accuracy and negative log-odds. However, the
DMC included items in which the indicative was expected along with
items in which the subjunctive was expected. In order to evaluate our
hypotheses, we must
in which the
subjunctive was mandatory. In this case, a diﬀerence can be established
between the [−epistemic] contexts (condition A. Implicative and condition
B. Non-implicative) and the [+epistemic; –veridical context] condition
(condition C. Weak Epistemic). In the former case, the subjunctive is

With respect to the variable AGE GROUP, the results conﬁrmed increasing
overall accuracy with increasing age, mirrored in the log-odds values,
which were negative in the six- to seven-year-old age group (–·),
increased in the eight- to nine-year-old group (–·), and achieved ·
in the ten- to twelve-year-olds. The thirteen- to sixteen-year-old group
presented the highest accuracy value and the highest log-odds (·). We
will return to the eﬀect of AGE when analyzing its eﬀects in each condition,
particularly the subjunctive conditions.

Concerning the variables associated with the quantity of input, which are
at the core of this study, the results showed higher rates of accuracy in
children who were ﬁrst-born (·% of overall accuracy and positive
log-odds of ·), compared to children who had older siblings (·% of
overall accuracy and a negative log-odds of –·). Also the group of
children who had two ﬁrst-generation parents diﬀered from the group
with at least one second-generation parent (·% overall accuracy and
positive log-odds of ·, against ·% and negative log-odds of –·,
respectively). This is consistent with predictions f. and g. To the extent

that having ﬁrst- or second-generation immigration parents or having older
siblings is reﬂected in the amount of input received, our results conﬁrm that
less input results in lower accuracy rates of mood choice in complement
clauses.

In order to speciﬁcally evaluate the eﬀects of AGE AT TESTING and the
amount of INPUT per condition, we ran additional separate GLMM models
for each condition. As expected, concerning the indicative conditions, no
signiﬁcant predictor variables were selected, either for the ﬁction verbs or
for the strong epistemic contexts. This means that the rate of accurate
indicatives is not predicted by age at testing or by the quantity of input.

In contrast, age at testing and the quantity of input are particularly
relevant in the conditions corresponding to subjunctive contexts. The
following variables were selected as signiﬁcant predictors for each condition:
. Implicative: PARTICIPANT [random] and AGE GROUP (·e-) + PARENTS

. Non implicative: PARTICIPANT [random] and AGE GROUP (·e-) +

. Weak epistemics: PARTICIPANT [random] and AGE GROUP (·e-) +

(·)

PARENTS (·)

SIBLINGS (·)

Note that the variable AGE GROUP was selected as a signiﬁcant predictor in all
three subjunctive conditions, the variable PARENTS in the implicative and
non-implicative conditions, and SIBLINGS in the weak epistemic context.

In order to allow an exploration of the data in more detail, Table 
presents the accuracy rates in the three subjunctive conditions, organized
by age group and parents’ proﬁle.

Several observations have to be made regarding these results. The ﬁrst
concerns the low production of subjunctives, independently of the parents’
proﬁle, in the youngest age group (–·%). The second concerns the
course of development, organized according to age and parents’ proﬁle, in
the immediately following age groups: children with two ﬁrst-generation
parents revealed a greater increase in accuracy at the eight to nine years
and the ten to twelve years point compared to children with second-
generation parents, who showed a clear delay. Children whose parents (or at
least one of them) were second-generation immigrants only demonstrated a
bigger increase in accuracy rates after age twelve.

Even though we are now looking only at raw data representing the percentage
of correct answers, we can see that the group of children with ﬁrst-generation
parents showed a relevant increase of target-like production from the ﬁrst to
the second age span in all three conditions. This tendency was not mirrored in
the group of children from second-generation households, who revealed a
smaller increase of target-like production of subjunctives from the ﬁrst to the

second age span in all three conditions. In the group of children from
second-generation households, the strongest acquisition eﬀect occurred only
from the age group ten to twelve years to the age group thirteen to sixteen
years, i.e. later than in the other child group. However, in the older age span
(thirteen to sixteen years), the children from second-generation households
reached accuracy rates similar to children from ﬁrst-generation households.
This suggests that both child groups eventually reach very similar proﬁciency
at older ages, even though the amount of input which they are exposed to
inﬂuenced the rate of acquisition.

D I S C U S S I O N A N D C O N C L U S I O N S
The main goal of this study was to describe the acquisition of mood selection
in complement clauses by HSs of EP, and to compare this process to what is
described for monolingual speakers. Answering the ﬁrst research question,
the results
in
complement clauses following an acquisition path similar to the one
followed by monolingual EP children. For both types of speakers, the use
of the indicative mood, required in [+epistemic; +veridical] contexts, did
not pose great diﬃculties in any age span. Like monolingual EP children,
child HSs of EP preferred the use of the indicative in epistemic veridical
contexts, both with strong epistemic and with ﬁction verbs. In the same
conditions, the youngest HL children (aged six to seven) already preferred
the indicative (% accurate answers with ﬁction verbs and % with
strong epistemic verbs). However, an interesting particularity was observed
in the indicative contexts with ﬁction verbs. Some child HSs occasionally
employed the subjunctive mood in these conditions. This tendency was
observed in almost all age groups, but was more salient in the oldest age
span (age thirteen to sixteen: ·–·% of subjunctives with ﬁction
verbs). Interestingly, this performance was equally found by Jesus ()
for monolingual children, but at younger ages. This performance may
signal that the acquisition of the relevant semantic properties that regulate
mood choice in EP complement clauses goes through a process in which
non adult-like mood choice triggers play a role. In this case, it might be
that children explore the possibility that mood contrasts encode the
for mood choice in
irrealis/realis opposition, which is not
complement clauses in Portuguese. If
irrealis is also
associated with some subjunctive contexts in German, cross-linguistic
inﬂuence could explain the higher number of subjunctive uses in irrealis
contexts in child HSs children than that obtained in the study involving
EP monolingual children. Since, in the case of the HSs, this performance
was identiﬁed in older ages,
it appears that this population did not
overcome this transitory period. This observation was reinforced by the

results of the eight adult HSs, who also sporadically produced subjunctives
with ﬁction verbs and with the (prospective) epistemic verb to promise (c.
·%), showing some kind of fossilization. Thus, a transitional period,
observed in monolingual acquisition, may be reinforced by the presence of
a similar constraint in the majority language.

The subjunctive conditions give further revealing insights into the
development of a HL. Similarly to what was observed for monolingual EP
children by Jesus (), heritage bilinguals overall performed worse in
subjunctive than in indicative contexts, corroborating the prediction that,
qualitatively, both groups show identical mood asymmetries. However,
contrary to monolingual children, heritage bilinguals still produced high
rates of indicatives in the [−epistemic] subjunctive contexts even after the
age of eight years, signalling that the acquisition of the subjunctive in
complement clauses starts much later in this population and may continue
until adolescence. This observation conﬁrms that HL and monolingual
children show a similar acquisition path, to the extent that the order of
acquisition of the diﬀerent subjunctive contexts was similar, but they
demonstrated quantitative diﬀerences that revealed protracted development
of the HL. In the case of HL acquisition, there was also a higher rate of
non-adult-like inﬁnitives compared to the indicative contexts. As in
monolingual acquisition, this may signal the place of the inﬁnitive in the
ﬁrst steps of a semantic opposition concerning mood (Hyams, ), or a
diﬃculty with the subjunctive morphology, with the inﬁnitive occurring
here as a suppletive form.

The fact that the diﬀerences between monolingual and HL children were
mainly quantitative, i.e. diﬀerences in the rate of acquisition, rules out the
prediction that direct transfer from German inﬂuences the acquisition of
the distribution of mood. The bilingual children acquired the semantic
constraints that encode mood selection in EP complement clauses and,
except
for a possible reinforcement eﬀect concerning subjunctive use
associated with irrealis contexts, they did not show deviations that could
be explained by transfer from German.

[−epistemic]

The older bilingual children (older than twelve years) and the adult HSs
produced high rates of
contexts
(condition A. Implicative and Condition B. Non-implicative). We can thus
conclude that this population acquires the semantic feature that triggers
the selection of the subjunctive in [−epistemic] contexts and uses it in the
appropriate contexts, although later than monolinguals. The [+epistemic;
−veridical] contexts, however, remained problematic even for the oldest
children. This signals more problems in choosing the subjunctive in
contexts that are epistemic and non-veridical at the same time (condition
C. Weak Epistemic). Again, these problems seem to be inherent to the
development of mood in EP, since they are also observed in monolingual

children, even though at younger ages. The fact that the [+epistemic;
−veridical] context is the most problematic one, also in the HSs group,
also conﬁrms that in HL acquisition epistemicity precedes veridicality.
This may indicate that
remain a locus of
vulnerability in HL acquisition, most probably because reduced input
after the optimal period hinders full stabilization of the target property
(Meisel, ). This is compatible with the idea that
the linguistic
domains where monolinguals display more variability are those where HSs
show the lowest results in testing situations (see discussion in Rinke &
Flores, , and van Osch, Aalberse, Hulk & Sleeman, in press).

late-acquired properties

i.e. all children,

independently of

The second research question focused on the role of the amount of input.
The regression analysis showed signiﬁcant eﬀects of age at testing, parental
input, and birth order in the use of the subjunctive. When analyzing the
percentage correct scores achieved by the diﬀerent groups, it is noticeable
that in the youngest age span (six to eight years) both groups performed
similarly,
family structure, showed
diﬃculties in producing the subjunctive. Also in the oldest age span
(thirteen to sixteen years) both groups revealed a similar performance, in
this case showing high rates of accuracy in the implicative (·–·%),
and even higher in the non-implicative contexts (·–·%), and an
accuracy rate of ·–% in the weak epistemic contexts. These results
indicate that, up to age eight, HL children have still not acquired the
subjunctive, regardless of the amount of contact with EP at home, but the
amount of exposure seems to matter after this age for this particular
structure.

In general, children from ﬁrst-generation households achieved higher rates
of correct answers earlier than children from mixed households, showing that
the amount of exposure to the HL inﬂuenced the speed of language
acquisition in this particular domain. It seems that children with less input
need more exposure over time in order to acquire the semantic values
associated with the subjunctive in complement clauses. This observation is
in line with ﬁndings from other studies, which attribute acquisition delays
in bilingual language acquisition to reduced language exposure (Austin,
; Blom, ; Gathercole, ; Gathercole & Thomas, ; Hoﬀ
et al., ; Rodina & Westergaard, ; Schlyter, ; Suchtelen,
; Thomas, Williams, Jones, Davies & Binks, ; Unsworth, ;
Unsworth et al., ). However, the amount of accumulated input that
child HSs in mixed households get up until sixteen years of age seems to
be suﬃcient to ensure acquisition of the relevant properties. Furthermore,
as suggested by several authors (Hoﬀ et al., ; Shin, ), birth order
also appears to have an eﬀect on the acquisition path, since ﬁrst-born
children present higher rates of accuracy than second- or third-born
children.

Summing up, we ﬁnd that the amount of parental input (even if with
similar age of onset) plays a crucial role in the acquisition of a minority
language. Furthermore, our results support the idea that reduced input
leads to delayed acquisition of late-acquired properties, since we only
found protracted development in the case of the subjunctive, but not the
indicative. In fact, in monolingual EP, target knowledge of the subjunctive
needs more time to stabilize than knowledge of the indicative. In HL
development, these late-stabilized properties are precisely the most aﬀected
by reduced input. In the case of
