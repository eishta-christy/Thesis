Intro.
Bilingual children are commonly categorized as either simultaneous or
sequential (Goldstein, ), although the age criteria deﬁning each group
vary among researchers. Without controversy, children who learn two
languages from birth are designated as simultaneous bilinguals (Padilla &
Lindholm, ), but so have been those who learn two languages within
the ﬁrst year after birth (Genesee, Paradis & Crago, ), or even up to
age three (McLaughlin, ). Following McLaughlin, we identify
children exposed to both languages before three years of age as
‘simultaneous bilinguals’, or, simply, bilingual children.

Phonetic category formation in the sense of this paper refers to the
processes by which bilingual or second language (L) speakers come to
distinguish phonetic details of shared phonemes in each language (Flege &
Eefting, ; Flege, ; Yeni-Komshian, Flege & Liu, ). For
example, Spanish and English share the phoneme /p/, but /p/ in each
language is produced with diﬀerent voice-onset-time (VOT) values. Thus,
it is an interesting question whether bilingual or L speakers exhibit
accurate phonetic realizations of Spanish /p/ and English /p/ when
speaking the two languages. While phonetic category formation in
production has been investigated extensively in adult bilingual and L
speakers (see Flege, ; Bohn & Munro, , for more information),
little such research has been carried out with bilingual children, although
more robust ﬁndings have been reported in the perceptual domain.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether three-year-old
Korean–English bilingual (KEB) children fully distinguish stop and vowel
categories in their productions of the two languages, and how these two
systems interact with each other. Whether bilingual children develop one
versus two linguistic systems in the learning of their respective languages
has long been of interest to bilingual researchers (Swain, ; Padilla &
Liebmann, ; Volterra & Taeschner, ; Genesse, ; Goodz,
). Although dominant findings support the notion that bilingual
children do operate with two systems, the question has not been fully
investigated in the phonetic domain among young bilingual children (i.e.
three-year-olds) due to methodological limitations (e.g. sample size). In
particular, most such studies examined the two-way voiced and voiceless
stop contrasts of English–Spanish or English–German bilingual children.
But it is not clear whether similar characteristics are found among KEB
children because Korean has a three-way laryngeal manner contrast in
stops. Moreover, previous studies examining the phonetic categories of
young bilingual children investigated either stops or vowels, not both
systems simultaneously, leaving open the question of whether these
develop in tandem or in sequence.
More recent attention has been paid to examining the degree of interaction
between the two languages of bilingual children (Paradis, ), and several
hypotheses have been proposed. Positing three types of interdependence
(transfer, acceleration, delay), Paradis and Genesee () hypothesized
that the grammars of bilingual children are acquired autonomously during
the acquisition process. Conversely, Johnson and Lancaster ()
concluded that the features of one language may influence those of the
other. While most research on this issue has dealt with the lexical,
syntactic, and phonological domains, the present study pursues the
question with respect to phonetic properties.
English and Korean stops and vowels
Before turning to the existing literature in phonetic category formation, we
briefly review the phonetics of stops and front vowels in Korean and
English. The Korean and English stop systems are compared in Table .
Korean contrasts three manners of stops, all of which are voiceless in
word-initial position, but these differ with respect to degree of aspiration
and f in the following vowel (Kang & Guion, ). The three Korean
stop types are often called ‘lenis’, ‘aspirated’, and ‘fortis’. The VOT
periods of lenis and aspirated stops are longer than for fortis stops, while
the f values of aspirated and fortis stops are higher than for lenis stops
(Cho, Jun & Ladefoged, ; Silva, ; Oh, ). Among adult male
speakers (Oh, ), Korean lenis stops are produced with moderate-lag
VOT (– ms) and low f (– Hz), aspirated with long-lag VOT
(– ms) and high f (– Hz), and fortis with short-lag VOT (–
 ms) and high f (– Hz). Recent research shows that the VOT
values for phrase-initial lenis and aspirated stops are converging among
contemporary, younger Seoul speakers, who distinguish these now only by
f (Silva, ; Iverson & Park, ). Unlike Korean, in word/phrase
initial position English contrasts just two stop categories, usually
characterized as ‘voiced’ versus ‘voiceless’ (see Iverson & Salmons, ,
for interpretation of these as ‘lax’ versus ‘aspirated’). These contrasts are
also reliably differentiated by VOT. Thus, Lisker and Abramson ()
reported that English voiceless stops are produced with long-lag VOT (
ms) and voiced stops with short-lag VOT ( ms). Similar to Korean
stops, moreover, f plays a role in differentiating voiceless from voiced
stops in English (Whalen, Abramson, Lisker & Mody, ) in that the
former are often associated with higher f than the latter.
There are five front vowels in English, all unrounded: /i ɪ e ε æ/. These
subcategorize as either tense (/i e/) or lax (/ɪ ε æ/) (Ladefoged, ).
Korean monophthongal vowels, on the other hand, include just two front
unrounded vowels: /i ε/. An additional mid front unrounded monophthongal vowel, /e/, has merged with /ε/ in the speech of most
Koreans, resulting in a contemporary system of seven monophthongs
overall (see Lee & Iverson, , for more information). Unlike English,
the Korean vowel system does not make a tense–lax distinction (e.g. /i/ vs.
/ɪ/).

The acoustic features of corresponding Korean and English vowels are
manifested diﬀerently (Yang, ). In general, F values of English
vowels are higher than those of Korean vowels for both male and female
speakers. For male speakers, the ﬁve English front vowels occupy vowel
space distinct from the two Korean front vowels /i ε/. For female speakers,
however, English and Korean /ε/ are produced in the same vocalic space,
though Korean /i/ remains distinct from the other English vowels.

Stop and vowel development in monolingual children.
Stop and vowel development in monolingual English- and Korean-learning
children has been well established. Literature reports that English-learning
children stabilized voiced and voiceless stop phonemes at – months
and – months, respectively (Macken & Barton, ; Lowenstein &
Nittrouer, ). After reviewing ten studies of phonological development,
Bernthal, Bankson, and Flipsen () summarized that English voiced
and voiceless phonological stop categories are fully developed by age three.
In comparison to English, age of acquisition for Korean stop contrasts
appears to vary. Kim and Stoel-Gammon () reported that accuracy
for stops produced by monolingual Korean children was less than % at
four years of age, arguing that Korean children distinguished stops mainly
by VOT, with f classiﬁcation emerging at around ;. The accuracy of
Korean stops reported in Kim and Stoel-Gammon was lower than the
previous studies (Kim, ; Kim & Pae, ), where % of stops were
accurately produced by two to three years of age. These discrepancies may
be due to the sample size. Kim and Stoel-Gammon () included only
ten children per age group.
Unlike stops, the literature consistently reports that both English and
Korean vowel distinctions are fully implemented by age three. Larkins
() collected  spontaneous utterances from each of twenty children
between  and  months of age. All English monophthongs, except for
/ɪ/ and [ɚ] (< /ər/), were produced with % accuracy. Even these two
vowels were produced with % accuracy. Pollock and Berni () also
reported a high percentage correct (%) of non-rhotic vowels for –
-month-old normally developing children. For Korean, Kwon ()
found that all vowels were produced with % accuracy at age ;. At age
;, /a i u ε/ were produced with % accuracy, the others (/o ɨ ʌ/) with
better than % accuracy. Thus, the ﬁndings of previous studies indicate
that both monolingual English- and Korean-learning children were able to
produce the stops and vowels of their native languages with high accuracy
by three years of age.

Although cross-linguistic studies may provide a basis for understanding
the speech of bilingual children, they have mainly been limited to
babbling (Boysson-Bardies, Halle, Sagart & Durand, ; Whalen, Levitt
& Goldstein, ; Rvachew, Alhaidary, Mattock & Polka, ). Only a
few studies have examined early word production cross-linguistically.
Chung, Kong, Edwards, Weismer, Fourakis, and Hwang () conducted
a cross-linguistic examination of the three ‘corner’ vowels /i a u/ in
English, Cantonese, Korean, Japanese, and Greek children and adults in
order to identify cross-linguistic diﬀerences in the acoustic realization of
the three shared vowels. They found that children as young as two years
of age demonstrated language-speciﬁc characteristics in their vowel spaces.
Speciﬁcally, Cantonese /i/ and /u/ vowels were more peripherally located
in the vowel space whereas those of English and Japanese were more
centralized.
Lee and Iverson (, ) also investigated whether cross-linguistic
differences appear in the vowel and stop productions of monolingual
English-speaking and Korean-speaking children at ages five and ten, and
reported that both vowels and stops reflected differences between English
and Korean to some degree. English-speaking children as young as five
years demonstrated higher F values for the back vowel /u/ than
Korean-speaking children, similar to adults (Yang, ). Stops produced
by the five- and ten-year-old monolingual English- and Korean-speaking
children also showed some distinctive characteristics. For example,
five-year-old children produced Korean aspirated stops with longer VOT
than English voiceless stops; however, they produced English voiced stops
and Korean fortis stops similarly in terms of both VOT and f. In
addition, Lee and Iverson () found that in five-year-old monolingual
children, the five stop categories across English and Korean were not fully
separated acoustically, whereas ten-year-old monolingual children
distinguished all ﬁve categories. It is of interest, then, to investigate the
cross-linguistic acoustic characteristics of bilingual children younger than
ﬁve years of age.
Stop and vowel development in bilingual children
A number of production accuracy studies of bilingual toddlers have been
undertaken, but the majority of these have dealt with Spanish–English
bilingual (SEB) children. Goldstein and Washington () examined
English and Spanish stops produced by four-year-old SEB children and
found that production accuracy of English stops (%) and Spanish stops
(%) was similar to monolingual English-speaking (·%) or
Spanish-speaking children (%). High accuracy of stop production was
also reported in a subsequent study (Goldstein, Fabiano & Washington,
). In a recent study, Fabiano-Smith and Goldstein () examined
consonant accuracy among three-year-old SEBs, and reported accuracy
values of % for Spanish and % for English, which were lower than the
accuracy values found for four-year-old SEBs in the Goldstein and
Washington () study. Unlike previous studies, monolingual children
were significantly more accurate than bilinguals for Spanish stops, though
not for English stops. With respect to vowels, English and Spanish tokens
produced by three- to four-year-old SEB children were produced with
over % accuracy (Gildersleeve-Newmann, Kester, Davis & Pena, ;
Gildersleeve-Newmann, Pena, Davis & Kester, ). These studies
suggest that overall production of consonant and vowel accuracy in both
English and Spanish became similar to monolingual English-speaking
children by four years of age.
Inasmuch as many three- to four-year-old bilingual children demonstrate
well-established phonological stop categories, and are able to produce them
with relatively high accuracy, the question arises as to whether bilingual
children can form phonetically detailed categories as well. Fabiano-Smith
and Goldstein () hypothesized that “bilingual children perceive
phonetically similar sounds as common between their two languages and
categorize them into the same phonemic category” (p. ), though there
may be reduced use of allophonic variants of a shared phoneme. An
acoustic investigation of phonetic category formation allows us to test this
hypothesis.
Limited studies have examined phonetic category development in
bilingual toddlers. Deuchar and Clark () collected data on English
and Spanish stop consonants produced by a Spanish–English bilingual
child, reporting that adult-like English stop distinctions were established
at ;, a point at which Spanish stop distinctions were just beginning to
emerge. When English voiceless (aspirated) and Spanish voiceless (unaspirated) stops were compared, the VOT diﬀerence was signiﬁcant.
However, the VOT values of English voiced and Spanish voiced stops
were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. In another study, Johnson and Wilson
() observed two Japanese–English bilingual children, one at ; and
the other at ;. While the older child diﬀerentiated English and Japanese
in terms of the VOT of prevocalic voiceless stops, the younger child was
not able to diﬀerentiate them. Kehoe, Lleo, and Rakow () examined
four German–Spanish bilingual children longitudinally from ; to ;,
and reported great individual variety. Only one child demonstrated a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between Spanish unaspirated and German aspirated
voiceless stops, but not between voiced stops across languages.

In a later study, Fabiano-Smith and Bunta () included a relatively
larger number of three-year-old Spanish–English bilingual children (n = )
in their evaluation of stop productions. The English and Spanish voiceless
stops were compared to voiceless stops produced by eight monolingual
Spanish- and eight monolingual English-speaking children. It was found
that bilingual children produced the English stops with markedly less
aspiration than their monolingual peers, i.e. with reduced VOT values, but
they produced unaspirated Spanish stops similarly to Spanish-speaking
children. In terms of cross-language contrasts, then, the bilingual children
did not produce distinctively diﬀerent VOT values for the voiceless stops
of English and Spanish, rendering them both with short-lag VOT,
whereas VOT values for English (aspirated) and Spanish (unaspirated)
voiceless stops among monolingual children did diﬀer, as in adult speech.
These previous investigations of early phonetic category formation thus
present mixed results in that small-scale studies reported that bilingual
children showed distinctive phonetic categories for voiceless stops across
languages (specifically, aspirated versus unaspirated), whereas a group
study found that bilingual children did not evidence distinctive
categorization of these across the two languages. Phonetic category
formation in very young bilingual children is still open to inquiry,
therefore, and further studies are warranted to investigate whether
bilingual toddlers can implement laryngeal timing distinctions among
stops across languages.
It is well known, however, that after five years of age bilingual children are
able to distinguish the laryngeal details of similar stop phonemes (Watson,
; Lee & Iverson, , ). Watson examined stop productions of
five-, six, eight-, and ten-year-old French–English bilingual children. By
the age of six years, children had developed two sets of distinctions, but
not the five-year-old children. In recent studies, Lee and Iverson (,
) examined Korean and English stops and vowels produced by
Korean–English bilingual (KEB) children at five and ten years of age. The
ten-year-old KEBs were found to distinguish all stop categories across the
two languages, whereas the ﬁve-year-olds failed to diﬀerentiate details
between phonetically similar English and Korean stops. Speciﬁcally, the
ﬁve-year-old bilingual children produced English voiced stops and Korean
fortis stops with similar VOT and f values. Furthermore, their English
voiceless and Korean lenis stop pairs and English voiceless and Korean
aspirated stop pairs were also not diﬀerentiated. With respect to vowels,
however, both age groups of KEB children had fully distinctive English
and Korean vowel productions. Lee and Iverson examined all English and
Korean vowels in their study, but front vowels were discussed only brieﬂy.
Both ages of KEB children produced Korean /i/ signiﬁcantly diﬀerently
from English /ɪ/, and Korean /ε/ was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from English
/æ/. Lee and Iverson stressed the importance of diﬀerential development
in phonetic category formation between vowel and stop categories in
bilingual children, noting that vowels are typically acquired earlier than
consonants. But as they examined the speech of only ﬁve- and ten-year-old
KEB children, the question remains as to just when phonetic category
diﬀerentiation begins to emerge.

Autonomy versus interdependence.
Assuming that a bilingual child possesses two separate systems, the next
logical question is whether the two linguistic systems interact with each
other. Paradis and Genesee () argue for the two system hypothesis of
‘autonomous’ acquisition: “. . . the bilingual children show no evidence of
transfer, acceleration, or delay in acquisition, and support the hypothesis
that their grammars are acquired autonomously” (p. ). Conversely, the
notion that two systems interact so that speech production diﬀers from
that of monolingual children is referred to as ‘interdependence’ (Johnson
& Lancaster, ). In support of the interdependence hypothesis,
previous studies have consistently showed that speech production is not
always the same between bilingual and monolingual children (Mack, ;
Khattab, ; Paradis, ; Johnson & Wilson, ; Baker &
Troﬁmovich, ; Lee & Iverson, , ; Fabiano-Smith & Bunta,
). For example, Lee and Iverson found that ten-year-old KEB
children produced Korean aspirated stops with longer VOT as compared
to monolingual Korean children, indicating a dissimilation eﬀect in which
they tended to maximize the VOT diﬀerences among Korean lenis,
Korean aspirated, and English voiceless stops. For vowels, ten-year-old
KEB children produced higher F values in the Korean back vowels /u o/,
whereas they produced English /æ/ with higher F, which indicates both
assimilation and dissimilation. Based on previous studies, it is not still
clear whether and/or how the two linguistic systems interact. Further
study is warranted.
<Middle>
Purpose of the study.
The present study has three goals: ﬁrst, to investigate whether three-year-old
KEB children form distinctive phonetic categories in production; second, to
examine whether distinctive phonetic production categories appear in both
stop and vowel systems; and third, to investigate how the two systems
interact. We ﬁrst compare stops and vowels produced by monolingual
English- and Korean-speaking children in order to identify cross-linguistic
production patterns in monolinguals. Then we compare stops and vowels
across English and Korean produced by KEB children to identify whether
distinctive phonetic categories appear in stops and vowels. Finally, we
compare stops and vowels produced by KEB children with those of their
monolingual counterparts in order to identify similarities and diﬀerences
in stop and vowel productions among the two groups.

M E T H O D S.
Participants.
A total of forty-two children ( monolingual English-speaking, 
monolingual Korean-speaking,  KEB), whose ages ranged from ; to
;, participated in the study. The monolingual English-speaking
children (M = ;) were recruited from Texas in the US and the
Korean-speaking children (M = ;) from Seoul metropolitan areas in
South Korea. These children were raised in monolingual families where
Southwestern American English or standard Korean (Seoul dialect) was
spoken. All participating monolingual children were from families of
middle or higher socioeconomic status and all mothers had received a high
school or higher education. None of the participating children had a
history of speech or hearing impairment, based on reports from both
teachers and parents. In order to establish further their normal
development of communication skills, monolingual children were
examined using the Preschool Language Scale -Screening Test (PLS-
Screening; Zimmerman, Steiner & Pond, ) for English, and the
Communication section of the Korean Age and Stage Questionnaire
(K-ASQ; Heo, Squires, Lee & Lee, ) for Korean. These screening
tests only indicate whether a child demonstrates age-appropriate
development. Test results confirmed that all monolingual children were
within normal limits.
The bilingual children (M = ;), who lived in Texas, were recruited on
the basis that a candidate child must satisfy four criteria: (a) be exposed to
both English and Korean for at least  months; (b) have one parent who
is a native speaker of English so that both languages are spoken at home,
or attend English-speaking daycare centers at least three times per week if
only Korean is spoken at home; (c) have a mother who received at least a
high school education; and (d) be from families of median household
income. Bilingual participant characteristics are illustrated in Table .

PLS- Screening and K-ASQ were also used to evaluate overall language/
communication skills, although these assessments were not designed
speciﬁcally for bilingual children. All bilingual children were within
normal range for the K-ASQ and PLS-. Based on the screening tests as
well as interaction with the primary investigator, who is a Korean–English
bilingual speaker, each child’s proﬁciency was rated for each language on a
scale from  (child could not speak the indicated language at all) to 
(child had native-like proﬁciency in the language). These scales have been
used in previous bilingual studies (Pena, Bedore & Rappazzo, ;
Fabiano-Smith & Goldstein, ). The language proﬁciency for each
child was discussed with parents. Based on the test results, speech and
language skills during assessment, and parent reports, all of the bilingual
children were rated as either  or  in both Korean and English.

Stimuli.
Tables  and  show the words containing target stops and monopthongal
front vowels for English and Korean. These words were selected because
of similar (if not always identical) context, viz., non-high vowels following
prevocalic stops, and because they are likely to be familiar to children as
young as three years of age, with a few exceptions.

Data-collection procedure.
Picture-naming tasks were used to elicit target stops and vowels. In the event
that a three-year-old child did not know some target words, a delayed
imitation technique was employed. For example, the facilitator produces the
target word (e.g. ‘crying’) in a sentence and asks the child for the target
word: “This boy is crying. There are tears on his face. What is he doing?”
Some studies examining the speech of young children have employed
direct imitation using a recorded audio stimulus naming the picture played
via speakers, or the experimenter’s voice prompt (Lee, Potamianos &
Narayanan, ’ Chung et al., ). The delayed imitation technique
allows us to obtain target word productions, but also prevents children
from directly imitating auditory cues, although Goldstein, Fabiano, and
Iglesias () as well as others (Bankson & Bernthal, ; Andrews &
Fey, ) reported that the vast majority of words were produced
identically in both imitative and spontaneous speech.
The monolingual and bilingual data were collected at daycare centers or in
participants’ homes in a quiet room in a natural play setting. PLS- and/or
K-ASQ were given first; then, target sounds were elicited using the ‘fishing
game’, in which each of the target pictures was placed on a fish. When a child
caught a fish, the child was asked to name the picture. Each word was elicited
three times by asking “Say once more”. Most monolingual and bilingual
children were able to produce the target words for vowels spontaneously.
English got and cop were elicited using the delayed imitation technique for
all children. English dot and Korean /tʰal/ ‘mask’ were also elicited by the
delayed imitation technique for bilingual children.
A digital flash recorder (Marantz Model PMD) and a wireless
microphone (Sennheizer Model EW) were used to record at a sampling
rate of · kHz. Each child wore the wireless microphone clipped to
clothing at the shoulder. A Korean–English bilingual researcher collected
all Korean and English data from the bilingual children. English and
Korean tokens were elicited separately. When English words were being
elicited, conversation with the experimenter was in English only, and
when Korean words were elicited, all conversation was in Korean.

Acoustic analysis.
Computerized Speech Lab (model , Kay Elemetrics) was used to analyze
the recordings. Speech recordings were downsampled to · KHz. Among
three productions for each target word, two productions were selected for
acoustic analysis. The selected tokens were correctly produced and
acoustically measurable productions with similar pitch or amplitude. Any
tokens with missing burst or devoiced tokens were not included for acoustic
analysis. Some children tended to produce the third repetition with either
rising or falling pitch. Choosing two tokens which had relatively consistent
pitch can provide more reliable data.

For stops, VOT and f were obtained for each target word. VOT was
measured from the beginning of the stop release to the onset of voicing in
the following vowel, using both waveforms and wide-band spectrograms. f
was measured at voicing onset with a  ms window from the first harmonic
value in the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in the following vowel. For
vowels, a spectrogram of each word containing a target vowel was made
using a -point discrete Fourier transform analysis with a  ms
Hamming window. First and second formant frequency (F & F) values
were taken at the mid-point of the steady state portion of vowel between
vowel onset and offset points and were computed automatically by Linear
Predictive Coding (LPC) analysis with the order of  and visually verified
using the spectrographic display. Formant frequencies obtained were
converted to bark scale in order to normalize for any possible gender
differences (Traunmüller, ). Vowel onset was defined as the onset of
regular periodicity on the acoustic waveform corresponding to a visible F
trace on the spectrogram. Vowel offset was defined as the point where
waveform periodicity ceases and waveform amplitude decreases markedly.
For reliability, measurements of randomly selected tokens (%) were
made independently by another researcher. A Pearson correlation
coefficient between the original and new values was obtained using
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The correlation
between the two measurement values was significant (γ () = ·,
p < ·). A correlation coefficient greater than . indicates the variables
to be highly associated. Thus, acoustic values were measured consistently.
Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons of vowel formants, duration and VOT, and f values of
stops were completed using SPSS (v.). For between-group comparisons,
mixed analysis of variances (ANOVA) and independent t-tests were used, and
paired t-tests for within-subjects comparisons were conducted. A significance
level of p < · was adopted. Effect size was calculated using partial eta squared
(η
p), interpreting the effect as follows: ·–· = negligible; ·–· = small;
·–· =moderate; and · and greater = large (Rosenthal & Rosnow,
).
RESULTS
Production accuracy of stops
Before an acoustic analysis was conducted, accuracy of the stop productions
was evaluated. A native speaker of English or Korean, who was blind to the
study, independently listened to all target word productions in her respective
language. They were asked to listen to tokens saved as a separate digital file
and transcribe what they heard. The speech tokens were played using a
waveform editor so that each token could be played as often as necessary.
Ten percent of the data were re-transcribed by a second native speaker of
each language for inter-transcriber reliability. The phoneme-by-phoneme
inter-rater reliability was % for English stops and % for Korean stops.
Of  English stops, ·% and ·% were correctly produced by
monolingual English (ME) and KEB children, respectively. An independent
t-test revealed no significant difference on accuracy of English stops between
ME and KEB children (t() = –·, p = ·). The small number of
English stop errors produced by monolingual English and KEB children
were related to place of articulation, not voicing or aspiration. Two ME
children and one KEB child produced cop for top or top for cop once.
Accuracy on the  Korean stops was lower than for English. Ninety-one
percent of Korean stops were correctly produced by monolingual Korean
(MK) children, whereas % produced by KEB children were phonemically
accurate. An independent t-test revealed no significant difference on
accuracy of Korean stops between MK and KEB children (t() = –·,
p = ·). All errors in Korean were related to VOT; accuracy of fortis stops
was higher than lenis and aspirated stops by both monolingual and bilingual
children. The detailed percentage of accuracy for Korean and English stops
is shown in Table .
Acoustic analysis of stops
Comparisons between monolingual English- and Korean-speaking children.
Figure  (top panel) shows VOT (x-axis) and f (y-axis) for monolingual
English- and Korean-speaking children. VOT and f values for the three
places of articulation were combined because the focus of the study is on
phonetic category formation in stops with respect to laryngeal contrast, not
place of articulation. In addition, patterns were similar among the three
places of articulation when the VOT and f values of English and Korean
stops were compared separately for each place of articulation. Thus, six
independent t-tests for all comparisons between English and Korean were
conducted in order to examine whether each English and Korean pair is
significantly different. The six comparisons included: English voiced–
Korean lenis; English voiced–Korean aspirated; English voiced–Korean
fortis; English voiceless–Korean lenis; English voiceless–Korean aspirated;
and English voiceless–Korean fortis. The alpha-level was adjusted to .
(./) because six comparisons were made. The significant pairs are listed
in Table .
English voiced and Korean fortis stops were produced with shorter VOT,
whereas English voiceless, Korean lenis, and Korean aspirated were
produced with longer VOT. Each of the stop types showed considerable
deviation along this continuum. Independent t-tests indicated that VOT
values of English voiced stops were significantly different from those of
Korean lenis and aspirated stops. VOT values of English voiceless stops
were also significantly different from those of Korean fortis stops.
However, the other English and Korean pairs (voiced–fortis, voiceless–
lenis, voiceless–aspirated) were not significantly different. In terms of f
values, none of the English–Korean stop pairs showed significant difference.
Comparisons between English and Korean among bilingual children. Figure 
(bottom panel) shows the VOT (x-axis) and f (y-axis) values of stops
produced by KEB children. Results of paired t-tests using Bonferroni
correction were given in Table . As with the monolingual children,
English voiced and Korean fortis stops were produced with shorter VOT,
but English voiceless, Korean lenis, and Korean aspirated stops were
produced with longer VOT. Deviation in f for the Korean fortis stop was
greater than the English voiced stop, while f values for the English
voiceless and Korean aspirated stops nearly overlapped. The t-test results
of VOT for each comparison were similar to those of monolingual
children. VOT values of English voiced stops were significantly different
from those of Korean lenis and aspirated stops, and VOT values of
English voiceless stops were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of Korean
fortis stops, but the diﬀerences of VOT values for the other pairs were not
signiﬁcant. Similarly, none of the f values of English and Korean stop
pairs were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in KEB children.
Comparisons between monolingual and bilingual children in English. Figure 
(top panel) shows means and standard deviations of VOT values for voiced
and voiceless English stops produced by ME and KEB children. Since the
present study focuses on laryngeal contrast between monolingual and
bilingual children, VOT values of three place of articulation were
combined. A mixed ANOVA revealed no significant two-way interaction
between voicing type and group (F(,) = ·, p = ·, ηp=·). The
main effect for group (F(,) = ·, p = ·, η
p = ·) was not
significant, either. However, there was significant main effect for voicing
type (F(,) = ·, p < ·, η
p = ·). As expected, VOT of voiceless
was significantly longer than that of voiced in both monolingual and
bilingual children.
Figure  (bottompanel) showsmeans and standard deviations of f values for
voiced and voiceless English stops produced byMEandKEBchildren.Amixed
ANOVA revealed significant interactions for voicing type * group (F(,) =
·, p = ·, η
p = ·), as well as a significant main effect for voicing type
(F(,) = ·, p = ·, η
p = ·). Post-hoc comparison (using α = ·)
indicated that f values for English voiceless stops produced by KEB children
were significantly higher than ME children (p = ·). f values for English
voiced stops were insignificant between the two groups (p = ·). The main
effect for group was not significant (F(,) = ·, p = ·, η
p = ·).
Comparisons between monolingual and bilingual children in Korean. Figure 
(top panel) shows VOT values for three types of Korean stops produced by
MK and KEB children. KEB children produced longer VOT for lenis stops
than MK, whereas both groups of children produced aspirated and fortis
stops with similar VOT values, resulting in a less clear distinction between
lenis and aspirated stops in KEB children. A mixed ANOVA revealed no
p = ·) nor
signiﬁcant
main eﬀect for group (F(,) = ·, p = ·, η
p = ·). However, there

two-way interactions (F(,) = ·, p = ·, η


indicated that VOT values
was a significant main effect for voicing type (F(,) = ·, p < ·, η
p =
·). These results indicated that both KEB and KE children demonstrated
distinctive phonemic categories among the three-way Korean stops.
Non-significance between the two groups may be due to the greater
variability of VOT values in both groups of children. Post-hoc comparison
(using α = ·) indicated that VOT values for aspirated stops were
significantly longer than those of lenis (p = ·) and fortis (p < ·).
VOT values for lenis stops were significantly longer than fortis (p < ·).
Figure  (bottom panel) shows f values for three types of Korean stops
produced by MK and KEB children. Lenis stops were produced with
lower f values than aspirated and fortis stops. KEB children showed more
variability than MK children for all types of Korean stops. A mixed
ANOVA indicated that a two-way interaction effect was not significant
(F(,) = ·, p = ·, η
p = ·), nor was a main effect for group found
(F(,) = ·, p = ·, η
p = ·). However, there was a significant main
effect of voicing (F(,) = ·, p < ·, η
p = ·). Post-hoc comparison
(using α = ·) indicated that f of aspirated (p < ·) and fortis (p < ·)
stops was significantly higher than that of lenis; however, there was no
significant difference in the f values between aspirated and fortis stops.
Production accuracy of vowels
Of the  Korean vowels, % production accuracy was found. Both MK
and KEB children produced all Korean vowels correctly. For the 
English vowels, % and % of vowels were produced accurately by
monolingual and bilingual children, respectively. An independent t-test
revealed no significant difference on accuracy of English vowels between
ME and KEB children (t() = ·, p = ·). The detailed percentage of
accuracy for each English vowel is shown in Table .
Acoustic analysis of vowels
Comparisons between monolingual English- and Korean-speaking children.
Figure  (top panel) shows F (x-axis) and F (y-axis) values of English and
Korean vowels as produced by monolingual English- and Korean-speaking
children. All were produced with similar deviations, except for Korean /i/,
for which deviation was greater in F. Independent t-tests were conducted
between monolingual English- and Korean-speaking children (see Table ).
The Korean vowel /i/ was compared with English /i/ and English /ɪ/.
Korean /ε/ was compared with English /ɪ/, /ε/, and /æ/. The alpha level was
adjusted to . (./). Results showed that among ﬁve pairs, three pairs,
such as Korean /i/ and English /i/, Korean /ε/ and English /ε/, and Korean /ε/
and English /ɪ/, were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. However, Korean /i/ and
English /ɪ/ and Korean /ε/ and English /æ/ diﬀered from each other in terms
of both F and F parameters.

Comparisons between English and Korean among bilingual children. Figure 
(bottom panel) shows F (x-axis) and F (y-axis) values of English and
Korean vowels produced by bilingual children. English /i/ and Korean /i/
were produced with similar deviations, whereas English /ε/ showed greater
deviations in F and F. Results of paired t-tests using the Bonferroni
correction are shown in Table . Findings were similar to those for
monolingual children in that Korean /i/ and English /ɪ/, as well as Korean
/ε/ and English /æ/, were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. However, other vowel
pairs were similar to each other in terms of both parameters.
Comparisons between monolingual and bilingual children in English. Figure 
shows the English vowels produced by ME and KEB children. In terms of
F, a mixed ANOVA indicated no significant interaction effect for vowel
type * group (F(,) = ·, p = ·, η
p = ·) nor main effect of group
(F(,) = ·, p = ·, η
p = ·). However, there was a significant main
effect of vowel type (F(,) = ·, p < ·, η
p = ·). Post-hoc
comparison (using α = ·) indicated that English vowels were significantly
different from each other (p < · for all comparisons) except for /ɪ/ and
/ε/ (p = ·). In terms of F values, there were no significant interaction
effects (F(,) = ·, p = ·, η
p = ·), nor main effect for group
p = ·). However, there was signiﬁcant main eﬀect
(F(,) = ·, p = ·, η
of vowel type (F(,) = ·, p < ·, η
p = ·). Post-hoc comparison
(using α = ·) indicated that F values of all English front vowels were
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from each other in both groups (p < · for all
comparisons).

Comparisons between monolingual and bilingual children in Korean. Figure 

mixed ANOVA indicated a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of vowel type (F(,) =

p = ·). Thus, monolingual Korean and bilingual
children produced diﬀerent F values for Korean /i/ and /ε/. However, no
signiﬁcant group eﬀect
and no
signiﬁcant vowel type * group interaction (F(,) = ·, p = ·, η

(,) = ·, p = ·, η

English and Korean stops and vowels produced by three-year-old monolingual
children.
Consistent with previous studies (e.g. Kim & Pae, ; Bernthal et al.,
), both three-year-old ME and MK children produced stops with
high accuracy. Our acoustic analyses conﬁrmed that ME children made
clear distinctions between voiced and voiceless English stop categories,
whereas MK children demonstrated separate fortis, lenis, and aspirated
phonemic stop categories in Korean. Similar to stops, four English front
vowels and two Korean front vowels were produced by monolingual
children with high accuracy, consistent with the previous studies (Kwon,
; Larkins, ; Pollock & Berni, ). Vowel phonemes in each
language were acoustically diﬀerent in terms of either F, F, or both.
Thus, the results of this study conﬁrm that phonemic categories for stops
and front vowels are well established by three years of age in monolingual
children.

When the acoustic features of English and Korean vowels were compared
cross-linguistically among ME and MK children, Korean /i/ and /ε/ were
produced with lower F and higher F values than English /ɪ/ and /æ/,
respectively. Identifying formant diﬀerences between Korean /i/ and
English /ɪ/, as well as Korean /ε/ and English /æ/ in monolingual children,
provides an important basis for investigating vowels produced by bilingual
children. Without understanding the cross-linguistic similarities and
diﬀerences of these vowel pairs in age-equivalent monolingual children, it
is diﬃcult to establish whether bilingual children produce English and
Korean vowels distinctively.

The diﬀerent formant values of Korean /i/ and English /ɪ/, as well as
Korean /ε/ and English /æ/, pairs were similar to monolingual English-
and Korean-speaking adults; however, the cross-linguistic similarities
between English /i/ and Korean /i/, as well as English /ε/ and Korean /ε/,
diﬀered from monolingual adults (Yang, ). Yang reported that
English /i/ and Korean /i/ were produced diﬀerently by both male and
female adult speakers, and English /ε/ and Korean /ε/ were produced
distinctively by adult males. The patterns of three-year-old children were
consistent with those of ﬁve- and ten-year-old children in a previous study
(Lee & Iverson, ), in that English and Korean /i/ and English and
Korean /ε/ were produced similarly by these older children. Thus, the
ﬁndings suggest that monolingual children may need more time until they
produce fully distinctive front vowel systems across English and Korean.

Unlike the vowels, language-speciﬁc characteristics were not obvious in
stops produced by three-year-old monolingual children. Although the
Korean fortis or English voiced stops (fall in the short-lag VOT) diﬀered
from the English voiceless or Korean lenis and aspirated stops (fall in the
long-lag VOT), respectively, in terms of VOT values, these stop pairs
were not further distinguished from each other in terms of f values.
Furthermore, the English voiceless stops were produced similarly to the
Korean lenis or aspirated stops with respect to both VOT and f values.
These results diﬀered from older monolingual children at ﬁve and ten
years of age (Lee & Iverson, ), for whom ﬁve stop pairs of English
and Korean diﬀered in terms of either VOT, f, or both. The ﬁndings
suggest that phonological stop distinctions within a language (e.g. voiced
vs. voiceless in English) may be fully established in children as young as
three years; however, the phonetic details for each language may not yet at
that point be completely implemented.

One versus two phonetic systems in three-year-old bilingual children
Two earlier studies (Lee & Iverson, , ) have reported that
ten-year-old KEB children demonstrate fully distinctive stop and vowel
systems, whereas ﬁve-year-old KEB children show distinctive systems for
vowels, but not stops. Thus, it is of interest to examine whether younger
KEB children distinguish stops and vowels diﬀerently. The current study
provides a comprehensive picture of the developmental pattern of phonetic
category formation in three-year-old KEB children.
Similar to monolingual children, three-year-old KEB children produced
both stop and vowel phonemes in English and Korean with high accuracy.
Acoustic analyses confirm distinctive phonological stop and vowel
categories in KEB children for both English and Korean. These results are
consistent with previous studies (Gildersleeve-Neumann et al., ;
Fabiano-Smith & Goldstein, ).
In stops, we did not find clear distinctions among the phonetic categories
of stops in bilingual children, parallel to the productions of monolingual
children. Among the six stop comparisons across English and Korean,
only stop pairs that fall into the different VOT categories (i.e. long-lag vs.
short-lag VOT) were significantly difference in VOT values. However,
none of these pairs differed in f values. Thus, our findings suggest little
evidence on detailed phonetic distinctions of stop categories among
bilingual toddlers. Previous studies (Deuchar & Clark, ; Johnson &
Wilson, ; Kehoe et al., ) have reported that one toddler per study
made phonetic distinctions for voiceless stops across languages (English
and Spanish voiceless stops or Spanish and German voiceless stops). The
differences may be attributed to type of investigation in conjunction with
sample size. With a relatively larger sample, Fabiano-Smith and Bunta
() also found that bilingual children did not distinguish English and
Spanish voiceless stops. After employing a substantial number of bilingual
participants, the current study is able to assess better whether bilingual
toddlers are sensitive to the acoustic properties of stops. It should be
noted, however, that our findings could be colored by the fact that Korean
has a more complex stop system than Spanish or German. Though our
previous study (Lee & Iverson, ) did not find fully distinctive stop
categories in five-year-old KEB children, it is not still known to what
extent three-year-old bilingual children may distinguish these three-way
categories; further studies should examine other groups of bilingual
toddlers involving complex stop systems (e.g. Thai or Hindi) in order to
verify the findings.
Unlike stops, we found that the three-year-old bilingual children
employed distinctive vowel categories across languages in their
productions; in particular, they were able to distinguish Korean /i/ and
English /ɪ/, as well as Korean /ε/ and English /æ/. The same patterns
appeared in the monolingual children of the present study as well as in the
five- and ten-year-old KEB children in the previous investigation (Lee &
Iverson, ). This finding suggest that distinctive vowel categories
emerge at a young age in KEB children. Previous studies on adolescent or
adult L learners reported merged vowel categories across languages (Bohn
& Flege, ; Guion, ; Baker & Troﬁmovich, ). Present ﬁndings
align with our previous study (Lee & Iverson, ) in suggesting that
early exposure to the English vowel system leads to more distinctive vowel
categories.

Based on consideration of both vowels and stops, our ﬁndings conﬁrm the
notion that simultaneous bilingual children operate with two separate
phonetic systems (Padilla & Liebmann, ; Genesse, ; Goodz,
). Similar to previous studies on the semantic (Goodz, ; Genesee,
Nicoladis & Paradis, ), pragmatic (Meisel, ; De Houwer, ;
Nicoladis, ), and syntactic levels (Meisel, , ; Kaiser, ),
which reported that bilingual children around two years of age show early
language separation, we ﬁnd that bilingual children also separate phonetic
systems at an age as early as three years.

The results of the present study, however, suggest that the two separate
phonetic systems may not emerge holistically in an across-the-board
fashion. That is, two distinctive systems may be realized in one sound
category (vowels) but not in the other (stops). Most previous studies
examining phonetic categories of bilingual children have investigated stops
(Deuchar & Clark, ; Johnson & Wilson, ; Kehoe et al., ;
Fabiano-Smith & Bunta, ), but only a few examined vowels in young
bilingual children (e.g. Kehoe, ). The fact that vowel distinctions are
typically acquired earlier than consonants has been widely reported in the
literature on both English- and Korean-speaking monolingual children
(Kwon, ; Hare, ; Bernthal et al., ; Kim & Stoel-Gammon,
), and our current study found this as well. But we did not ﬁnd
consistent support for the claim of Fabiano-Smith and Goldstein ()
that “bilingual children perceive phonetically similar sounds as common
between their two languages and categorize them into the same phonemic
category” (p. ), i.e. that bilingual children basically do not distinguish
phonetic details across languages at this young age.

Autonomous acquisition versus interdependence
On the understanding that bilingual children possess two linguistic systems,
the way in which these systems interact becomes of interest. Previous studies
examining speech production in bilingual children reported inﬂuence
patterns. For example, VOT values were not the same as those of their
monolingual counterparts (e.g. Lee & Iverson, ; Fabiano-Smith &
Bunta, ), vowel length contrast acquisition was delayed (e.g. Kehoe,
), and formants of vowels were diﬀerent as compared to their
monolingual counterparts (e.g. Lee & Iverson, ). Following Flege’s
() assumption, this pattern may be understood as ‘assimilation or
dissimilation’, or ‘transfer’ by Paradis and Genesee (). However, there
is also emerging evidence that the two languages may develop independently
without interaction among bilingual speakers who acquired two languages
early (e.g. Flege, Munro & MacKay, ; Munro, Flege & MacKay,
; Flege, MacKay & Meador, ; Kang & Guion, ). These
studies examined mainly adult bilingual speakers, not bilingual children.

In the present study, we found that most stop and vowel productions of
simultaneous KEB children were similar to those of monolingual children,
consistent with a claim that bilingual adult speakers who acquired two
languages simultaneously demonstrate speech production without much
interaction between the two languages. An exception to the independent
systems observation relates to the f values of English. KEB children
produced English voiceless stops with higher f values compared to
monolingual children. The higher f in the bilingual children seems to be
inﬂuenced by the higher f of Korean aspirated stops.

Paradis and Genesee () hypothesized that the grammars of bilingual
children are acquired autonomously because they found that bilingual
children showed the same patterns of acquisition as well as a similar
developmental rate as monolinguals. Although some transfer eﬀect may
appear in bilingual toddlers, the ﬁndings of the current study suggest that
in general the phonetic systems of simultaneous bilingual children may
develop interdependently. The discord in ﬁndings between the current
and previous studies may be attributed to diﬀering methodology and the
type of bilingual children (i.e. simultaneous vs sequential). Most previous
studies examining phonetic categories included bilingual children who had
varying onset of exposure to L, and some did not specify the onset of
exposure. For example, Fabiano-Smith and Bunta () included eight
Spanish–English bilingual children who were either simultaneous or L
learners. Similarly, Lee and Iverson (, ) reported that the KEB
children had at least two years of exposure for ﬁve-year-olds and ﬁve years
of exposure for ten-year-olds, leaving open the question of whether the
children were simultaneous or sequential bilinguals. By contrast,
the bilingual children in the current study maintained homogeneity in that all
twelve KEB children were exposed to both languages at  months of age.
Since very few group experiments have been conducted to examine the
production patterns of simultaneous bilingual toddlers, future studies are
warranted to identify diﬀerences in phonetic category formation and the
degree of interaction between simultaneous and sequential bilingual
children.

Limitations and future directions.
As the ﬁndings of the current study are based only on speech production, it
has not been established here whether KEB children demonstrate similar
characteristics in the perceptual domain. Moreover, it is not yet known
whether the same kinds of production patterns can be obtained among
other types of simultaneous bilingual children, such as Thai–English or
Hindi–English, whose L phonological systems differ significantly in other
ways from L English. Future studies are thus warranted to verify our
observations and their implications. By the same token, subsequent studies
may pursue an examination of individual participant characteristics, in
addition to group characteristics, among bilingual children. Finally, with
respect to vowels, the current study examined only front vowels, and these
were not always in the same phonetic context. Thus, further work should
compare the full English and Korean vowel inventories after selecting
target words with a more similar phonetic context.
