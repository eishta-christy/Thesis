Research has shown that observing iconic gestures helps typically
developing children (TD) and children with speciﬁc language
impairment (SLI) learn new words. So far, studies mostly compared
word learning with and without gestures. The present
study
investigated word learning under two gesture conditions in children
with and without language impairment. Twenty children with SLI
(age four), twenty age-matched TD children, and twenty language-
matched TD children were taught words that were presented with
either iconic or non-iconic gestures. Results showed that children of
all groups beneﬁted more successfully from observing iconic gestures
for word learning. The iconic gesture advantage was similar across
groups. Thus, observing iconic gestures prompts richer encoding and
makes word learning more eﬃcient in TD and language impaired
children.

I N T R O D U C T I O N
Human communication is multimodal, including gestures. Gestures are
visible actions of body parts (Kendon, ) and constitute a crucial part
of conversation. Co-speech gestures accompany spoken speech. They

comprehension of a spoken message (Beattie & Shovelton, ; Hostetter,
; Kendon, ) and help speakers retrieve information stored in the
mental
lexicon (Frick-Horbury & Guttentag, ; Krauss, Chen &
Gottesman, ; Ruiter, ). The close relationship between gesture
and speech and their mutual inﬂuence are widely recognized. Accounts of
embodied cognition assume that motor actions, such as observing a
speaker gesturing, enhance memory and learning (Madan & Singhal, ).
Gestures are classiﬁed into diﬀerent types. Here, we focus on iconic hand
gestures, which capture meaning aspects of the entity that is conveyed by the
gesture (McNeill, ), for example ﬂapping hands representing a bird
ﬂying. Iconic gestures have been suggested to facilitate word learning. It is
argued that iconic gestures are less arbitrary than most spoken symbols.
The visuospatial aspects of gesture help process the accompanying speech
and lead to strengthened memory traces
conceptual
understanding (Hostetter, ; So, Chen-Hui & Wei-Shan, ). A
comprehensive review of the existing literature (Hostetter, ) proposed
that gestures are particularly helpful to children. The focus of the present
study is on word learning in typically developing (TD) children and in
children with speciﬁc language impairment
(SLI). Previous research
indicated a gesture advantage in children with SLI as compared to their
TD peers such that they show stronger associations between gesture and
language (Botting, Riches, Gaynor & Morgan, ), and beneﬁt more
from gesture input for pragmatic comprehension (Kirk, Pine & Ryder,
; Lavelli, Barachetti & Florit, ). So far,
this has not been
demonstrated for word learning. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate
the inﬂuence of gestures on word learning in typically developing and
language impaired populations.

Word learning in children with SLI
SLI is deﬁned as a developmental language disorder in the absence of any
identiﬁable reason for the disorder (Bishop, ; Leonard, ). It is
generally agreed that the population is heterogeneous and that children
with SLI show various deﬁcits in language, including slow acquisition of
the lexicon and grammar, and limited comprehension and production of
vocabulary
;
Conti-Ramsden & Botting, ; Leonard, ). Limited processing
capacities and diﬃculty with sustained attention are reported as well (Alt,

Scheuer, ; McKean, Letts & Howard, ; Sheng & McGregor, ).
Problems with word learning are often part of the characteristics associated
with SLI. Word learning is a process in which word representations are
gradually established, starting from an incomplete representation after ﬁrst
perceiving the new form–referent link through fast mapping until the
word is represented and stored completely through slow mapping (Horst
& Samuelson, ; Justice, Meier & Walpole, ). Children with SLI
are reported to have weak word knowledge,
i.e. weak semantic and
phonological representations, compared to peers. Thereby, both fast and
slow mapping are aﬀected (Alt et al., ; Gray, ; McKean et al.,
). Given that the vocabulary deﬁciencies seem to reﬂect immaturities
in semantic representation (McGregor, Newman, Reilly & Capone, ;
Sheng & McGregor, ), methods to support word learning in children
with SLI are desirable. Below, we summarize ﬁndings regarding the role
of iconic gesture as a means of enhancing word learning in TD children
and children with SLI.

Contribution of observing iconic gesture to children’s word learning
For word learning, children use a number of cues, gestures among them. To
derive beneﬁt from iconic gestures, two mechanisms are important. First, the
child has to be capable of detecting the meaning conveyed by the gesture.
While still fragile in toddlerhood, the ability to derive meaning from
iconic gestures develops at three years of age and is acquired by age ; to
; (Namy, Campbell & Tomasello, ; Novack, Goldin-Meadow &
Woodward, ; Stanﬁeld, Williamson & Özçaliṣkan, ; Tolar,
Lederberg, Gokhale & Tomasello, ). Preschool children can also learn
from arbitrary gestures, but once they are able to recognize iconicity they
learn from iconic gestures more readily than from arbitrary ones
(Marentette & Nicoladis ; Namy et al., ). Besides, some types of
iconic gestures appear to be easier to identify than others, for example
gestures depicting actions associated with an object (Hodges, Özçaliṣkan &
Williamson, ), and gestures showing how an object is handled are
recognized earlier in development than gestures based on the shape of an
object (Tolar et al., ). Second, the child has to be able to process and
integrate multimodal
information. While typical word learning implies
mapping a spoken word onto a referent, word learning paired with
gestures requires additional cognitive demands such that both a spoken
word and a gesture have to be mapped onto the referent (Puccini &
Liszkowski, ). It has been shown that children at age three are able to
integrate information presented in iconic gesture and speech (Sekine,
Sowden & Kita, ).

in toddlers. Moreover,

Evidence supporting the notion that observing iconic gestures facilitates
word learning for a range of word classes comes from studies with young
TD children. It has been demonstrated that seeing iconic gestures helped
preschool children to focus on a particular aspect of novel verbs and
thereby enhanced learning their meaning (Goodrich & Hudson Kam,
; Mumford & Kita ). Capone and McGregor () showed that
co-speech iconic gestures exemplifying the shape and function of novel
objects improved word retrieval
iconic shape
gestures were more eﬀective than pointing gestures (Capone Singleton,
). McGregor, Rohlﬁng, Bean,
taught
two-year-olds the preposition under either with or without iconic gestures.
At delayed post-test, children showed a more robust and abstract
knowledge of the meaning when the words were paired with a gesture.
Moreover, it was found that observing iconic gestures was particularly
eﬀective when spoken messages were complex (McNeil, Alibali & Evans,
). Observing
immediate
comprehension and, in particular, beneﬁt slow mapping (McGregor et al.,
; Munro, Baker, McGregor, Docking & Arciuli, ). Two studies
suggest that iconic co-speech gestures can serve to scaﬀold word learning
in children with SLI. Work by Ellis Weismer and Hesketh () has
shown that in a fast mapping task children with SLI as well as TD
children understood novel spatial terms better when the words were
trained with iconic gestures compared to words trained without additional
input. However, there were no eﬀects on naming. Lüke and Ritterfeld
() expanded this work by additionally investigating slow mapping.
Eﬀects of observing iconic shape gestures on the learning of names for
cartoon characters were compared to a no-gesture condition. Contrary to
Ellis Weismer and Hesketh’s () study, no immediate advantage of the
iconic gesture condition emerged. However, during slow mapping children
showed a gesture beneﬁt for naming – but not for comprehension. The
authors of both studies conclude that observing iconic gestures leads to
more eﬃcient word learning in children with SLI. Yet, generalization of
this conclusion has serious limitations. First, stimuli used in the studies
(novel words for spatial terms, whose meaning children already knew, and
proper names for cartoon characters) are not representative of the words
children acquire. Second,
the number of children with SLI in the
experimental groups was rather small (eight and ten children, respectively).
Moreover, in both studies the control condition was merely an absence of
gesture, involving no additional cues beyond speech. Hence, word learning
conditions diﬀered with respect to their processing demands (So et al.,
; Yap, So, Yap & Tan, ): Whilst in the iconic learning condition
both a spoken word and a gesture had to be mapped onto the referent, the
control condition required the child to process auditory information only

(Puccini & Liszkowski, ). In a ‘gesture vs. no-gesture’ design, it remains
unclear whether children beneﬁt from iconic gestures due to the speciﬁc
information conveyed by the gesture, or rather because the additional
input directed children’s attention to the target words and thus
visual
improved learning. In order to show that iconic gestures do more than
focus attention, demonstration of an iconic gesture beneﬁt over a control
condition that goes beyond a no-gesture condition is required. However,
studies comparing two diﬀerent gesture types in word learning (in terms
of mapping a lexical form and semantics) are rare. Lüke and Ritterfeld
() conducted a fast mapping experiment and found that both iconic
and arbitrary gestures had a beneﬁcial eﬀect on TD preschoolers’ initial
word learning. Capone Singleton () demonstrated enhanced learning
of novel nouns paired with iconic gestures as compared to pointing
gestures. Pointing gestures are stationary gestures which scaﬀold referential
understanding by focusing children’s attention on the referent whose
lexical form they are learning (Novack et al., ), provided the referent
is in the immediate environment. Iconic gestures, however, require
attention to hand movement
(Puccini &
Liszkowski, ). Results led Capone Singleton () to suggest that
iconic gestures enrich semantic learning, establish more robust word
knowledge, and in this way make word learning more eﬃcient than
pointing gestures do. The current study set out to substantiate and expand
these ﬁndings.

Current study
For this purpose, we designed a study to compare the learning of unknown
words (nouns and verbs) in a within-subjects design under two gesture
conditions. In the experimental condition, new words were taught with
iconic gestures. To ensure that a potential iconic gesture advantage does
not merely reﬂect enhanced attention to the target word, we applied a
control condition,
in which the target words were paired with an
attention-directing gesture in the form of a raised foreﬁnger in front of the
upper body. Such a gesture does not convey the semantic meaning of the
referents, and resembles pointing gestures in that it is stationary and
visually guides attention. At the same time, the control gesture covers
functions of
it directs attention to hand
movement, nevertheless lacking the speciﬁc property of iconic gestures,
namely visually capturing meaning aspects of the referent. Rather, the

allowed us to compare two conditions where both the spoken word and a
gesture have to be mapped onto the referent. In a subsequent control
experiment, we modiﬁed the control condition by using diﬀerent arbitrary
gestures instead of the constant attention-directing gesture.

We investigated the ability to learn words in two gesture conditions in TD
children and children with SLI, and assumed that children of either group
could master the task. Our main research interest was on the relative eﬀect
of observing co-speech iconic gestures on word learning. The following
hypotheses were tested:

. Observing iconic co-speech gestures should impact more eﬀectively on
word learning than observing non-iconic gestures. This hypothesis
grounds on research showing that children by the age of three can
master the cognitive requirements to process co-speech gesture and can
learn from iconic gestures. Moreover, enhanced learning with iconic
gestures as compared to pointing gestures was demonstrated in young
TD children (Capone Singleton, ). We expected that this eﬀect
would apply to the learning of both nouns and verbs, since an iconic
advantage over mere verbal input has been found for a range of word
classes, including nouns and verbs. Finally, former research gives rise
to the hypothesis that such an iconic eﬀect should be apparent at both
the initial learning and the retention of the new words.

. It was expected that observing iconic gestures would have a positive
inﬂuence on word learning in children with and without language
impairment. However, as children with SLI are a special group of
language learners it is unclear whether the degree of the iconic gesture
advantage diﬀers across groups.

were assessed using the screening version of
the Psycholinguistische

scoring reliability, a second investigator scored % of the standardized
assessments. Overall agreement was %.

In addition to parent report and therapist’s diagnosis, to be included in the
group with SLI the child had to perform more than one standard deviation
(SD) below the mean on at least three of the language subtests administered.
Controls had to perform within normal range in all language assessments.
Five children with SLI and thirteen TD children who did not meet the

standard deviations of the cognitive and language testing in terms of
percentile ranks and raw scores as well as between-group comparisons for
the children with SLI and the control groups are reported in Table .

All children fulﬁlled the requirement of lying within the normal range for
non-verbal cognition. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) showed a
signiﬁcant group eﬀect (F(,) = ·, p = ·, ω = ·). Post-hoc analyses
(Bonferroni) revealed that AM children performed signiﬁcantly better than
LM children on the cognitive measure (p = ·), an eﬀect which we
attribute to the use of diﬀerent tests in AM and LM children. There was
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between LM and SLI children (p = ·). AM
children did not diﬀer from children with SLI with respect to non-verbal
cognition (p = ·). Note that we were not interested in whether AM
children performed better in the training than children with SLI, but
instead in how the diﬀerent groups responded to the learning conditions.

Regarding language measures, mean scores for the children with SLI were
signiﬁcantly lower than the scores of the AM children on each of the
measures, whereas they did not diﬀer from those of the LM children. All
children with SLI exhibited limited expressive language abilities, eleven
children also showed receptive limitations. TD children exhibited overall
normal-range performance.

General procedure
All assessments and training took part in a separate room in children’s
nurseries. Within two weeks, children were seen individually for six
sessions lasting approximately  minutes each. All sessions were video
recorded (JVC camcorder HD Everio GZ-V). The procedure of the
assessment and the training was explained to the children by the
investigator in a child-appropriate way.

The ﬁrst two sessions comprised assessment of non-verbal cognition and
language measures (independent variables). Moreover, children’s knowledge
of the target words to be learned in the training (dependent variables:
naming and comprehension task) was assessed (T). Subsequently, three
training sessions were conducted two to three days apart. The target words
were introduced during the ﬁrst session and repeated in the following two
sessions. Learning achievement was assessed immediately after the ﬁrst
training (T, fast mapping) and two to three days after completion of the
training (T, slow mapping) – as shown in Figure .

represented unusual movement types. When using real words in a training
study, it is vital to ensure that children do not know the words prior to
training. Thus, nouns and verbs of very low frequency were chosen from
German dictionaries. Word frequency, if available, was determined by use
of the corpus-based collection of the University of Leipzig (University of
Leipzig, –). In a pre-study, the words had been tested in TD
four-year-old and ﬁve-year-old monolingual German children. None of
the children (n = ) had been able to name any of the stimuli. Assessment
of
three
distractors – showed a maximum of % to % of correct reactions to
stimuli, which is below the chance level of %. Word forms were
monosyllabic or bisyllabic, following the German trochaic prosodic pattern.
A pilot study revealed that children between four and ﬁve years of age were
easily able to learn twelve words. For younger children and children with
SLI, however,
learning twelve words caused mental overload, reduced
attention during training, and led to ﬂoor eﬀects. For these children,
learning eight new words turned out to be appropriate. In order to avoid
ceiling or ﬂoor eﬀects, we decided to train unequal numbers of target
words ( in AM,  in LM and children with SLI). Accordingly, data
analyses are based on percentages.

Learning conditions
Children learned words under two conditions: in the iconic gesture condition
(ICON), spoken stimuli were paired with a gesture that highlighted the
shape of the animal (nouns) or the manner and/or path of the movement
(verbs). Shape gestures had been shown to particularly support noun
learning (Capone & McGregor, ) whereas manner gestures helped
children interpret new verbs (Mumford & Kita, ). The gestures were
dynamic iconic symbols lasting for – seconds, performed with the hands
in the upper body or head region. A gesture-to-referent matching task was
conducted with twenty-four adult students (age –), conﬁrming that
adults were able to match the gestures to the respective referents in % to
% on average. In the control condition, stimuli were paired with an

attention-directing gesture (ATTENT) in the form of a raised foreﬁnger in
front of the upper body. Stimuli and conditions are given in Table .

Half of the target words were learned in the ICON condition, the other
half in the ATTENT condition. Words to be learned in the ICON and
the ATTENT gesture condition were counterbalanced across children but
remained paired with the referent throughout training.

Training procedure
All target words were introduced in the ﬁrst training session and repeated in
the next two sessions. Children were taught the words following a standard
protocol, hearing the target words repeatedly being paired with either the
ICON or ATTENT gesture. Children were allowed, but not encouraged,
to imitate the gestures; however, their gesturing was not responded to.
Throughout training, children were exposed to each target word twenty
times before the ﬁrst learning assessment (T) and ﬁfty-seven times before
the second (T). Since preschool children are familiar with listening to
stories and beneﬁt for word learning (Horst, Parsons & Bryan, ), a
story was created and illustrated in a story book. The story comprised all
target words and served as basis for the training. Training sessions were
organized in three phases and speciﬁed in detail
in a comprehensive
training manual (see Table  for an overview of the content of sessions).

Learning assessment
We were interested in both the initial stage of word learning (fast mapping)
and in the subsequent stage of gradual diﬀerentiation and retention of the
word’s meaning (slow mapping). Since our pilot study suggested that
compliance and task performance deteriorated with repeated testing, we
chose to assess learning performance immediately after the ﬁrst training
session (T) and two to three days after training completion (T). Learning
achievement was assessed through naming and comprehension tasks.

a. Assessment of naming performance: a single coloured picture of the target
in the middle of a page was shown to the child. The child was asked
“What is this?” or “What is he doing?”, respectively. Responses were
classiﬁed as accurate if
the child produced the target word or a
morphological variant within a multiple-word response. Responses of
children evidencing phonological diﬃculty were scored as correct if the
phonological variation of the word had systematically been observed in
the child’s productions on the assessment measures.

b. Assessment of comprehension performance: the investigator presented the
target word and the child had to point to one of four coloured pictures
on a page (one target and three distractors). Two distractors depicted

TA B L E . Content and structure of each training session

Activity

Picture book reading: Investigator reads story
live-voice to the child.

Play: Investigator uses modelling procedures
to specify semantic features of the referents
(appearance, environment, food, and special
attributes of animal species, location,
realization, and distinctive features of the
movement types).
Examples:
Noun Beisa ‘beisa’: “Here you see a beisa.
The beisa loves to eat hay. We can feed the
beisa. Hello beisa, are you hungry? Yes? So,
let`s give the beisa some hay.”
Verb staksen ‘to stalk’: “Now we will stalk.
To stalk we have to lift our legs. Look how I
stalk. Can you also stalk? Hey, it’s great how
you stalk!”
Watching a video: Child and investigator
jointly watch a video clip in which an actor
tells the story, thereby performing the
respective gestures.

an animal or movement that were taught during training, one distractor
depicted an animal or movement not included in the training that was
similar in shape and category to the target (e.g. target: rail, distractor:
blackbird). To be counted as a correct comprehension response, the
child had to point to the respective target.

Children earned one point for each correct response. For both naming and
comprehension, self-corrections leading to the targets within  seconds
were counted as accurate. Performance scores are expressed in percentages
as unequal numbers of words were trained across groups. To evaluate
scoring reliability, % of all dependent measures were scored via
videotape by a second coder blind to the learning condition of responses.
The mean point-to-point agreement was %.

Data analysis
Data were analyzed using omnibus -way mixed design ANOVAs with the
independent variables (IV): test time (T: pre-test, T: post-test , T:

and group (SLI, LM, AM)

post-test ) × gesture condition (ICON, ATTENT) × word class (nouns,
verbs)
as
between-subjects factor for the dependent variables comprehension and
naming. Greenhouse–Geisser corrections were applied where necessary.
Signiﬁcant main eﬀects were resolved by pairwise comparisons using
Bonferroni corrections. P-values were considered signiﬁcant at the p < ·
level. To quantify diﬀerences among learning conditions, test times and
word class eﬀect sizes (partial eta squared: ηp
) were calculated. Data were
analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics version .

R E S U L T S
Omnibus -way analyses tested the eﬀect of learning nouns and verbs under
two gesture conditions (ICON vs. ATTENT) over time (pre-test, post-test
, post-test ) in children with SLI and TD children matched for language
(LM) and age (AM). As no eﬀect of gender on learning performance was
found, data are collapsed in all analyses. We ﬁrst
report on the
comprehension task before turning to the naming task. Mean scores and
standard deviations (SD) are shown in Tables  and , respectively. An
overview of main and interaction eﬀects is given in Table .

Comprehension
The ANOVA conﬁrmed a main eﬀect of test time (F(·,·) = ·,
p < ·, ηp
 = ·). As expected, scores were signiﬁcantly higher at T
(M% ± SD:  ± ) than at T ( ± ; p < ·), which in turn were
signiﬁcantly higher than at T ( ± ; p < ·). No between-groups
eﬀect emerged (F(,) = ·, p = ·, ηp
 = ·), indicating that children of
all groups were able to learn the new words. There was a signiﬁcant main
 = ·), which was
eﬀect of word class
interactions time × word class (F(,) = ·,
modiﬁed by signiﬁcant
p = ·, ηp
 = ·), and time × word class × group (F(,) = ·, p = ·,
 = ·). As our research focuses on gesture condition rather than word
ηp
class per se, we did not follow up these eﬀects.

(F(,) = ·, p < ·, ηp

Importantly, comprehension varied by gesture condition, as revealed by a
signiﬁcant main eﬀect (F(,) = ·, p = ·, ηp
 = ·). Overall, children
demonstrated better comprehension of words presented with ICON than
ATTENT gestures. No signiﬁcant interaction time × gesture condition
was found (F(,) = ·, p = ·, ηp
indicating that condition
similarly inﬂuenced comprehension performance over time. Critically,
comprehension did not diﬀer between conditions at pre-test (t() = ·, p
= ·). No signiﬁcant interaction condition × word class was found (F
(,) = ·, p = ·, ηp
 = ·), demonstrating that gesture condition
aﬀected learning of both nouns and verbs. There was no signiﬁcant

both TD and language impaired children were able to learn the new words.
Beyond the demonstration of a general learning achievement, our study
yielded two main ﬁndings: (i) observing iconic gestures improved learning
to a greater extent than observing non-iconic gestures did; and (ii) the
iconic gesture advantage was similar in TD and language impaired
children. We will now review and discuss these ﬁndings.

The role of iconic gestures in word learning
Former research revealed that words are learned better while simultaneously
seeing iconic gestures than with mere verbal input in TD children (e.g.
Capone & McGregor, ; McGregor et al., ; Munro et al., )
and children with SLI (Ellis Weismer & Hesketh, ; Lüke &
Ritterfeld, ). In this study, we compared the eﬀects of observing
iconic and non-iconic (attention-directing and arbitrary gestures) and
demonstrated that the iconic gesture advantage holds true not only over
mere verbal learning. In accordance with our ﬁrst hypothesis, children
learned words (nouns and verbs) presented with iconic gestures better than
with a gesture that guided their attention towards the new words. This
was the case for both comprehension and naming during initial learning
(fast mapping) and retention.

the fact

Our results conﬁrm the ﬁndings of Capone Singleton (), who showed
enhanced word learning with iconic shape gestures over pointing gestures in
TD toddlers. The results strongly suggest that iconic gestures provide an
advantage over and above focusing children’s attention. Why do iconic
gestures provide an advantage for word learning? Both iconic and
non-meaningful gestures (like pointing and attention-directing) can focus
children’s attention and lead to increased salience of the target word, which
in turn supports the child’s fast mapping and retention of the lexical form.
Indeed,
that children comprehended the majority of words
presented with attention-directing gestures at post-test  (%), suggests
that to some extent attention-directing gestures do beneﬁt learning. Iconic
gestures, however, contribute to word learning in a diﬀerent way than just
making children more engaged and attentive (Mumford & Kita, ;
Novack et al., ). Rather,
it appears that speciﬁc features of iconic
gestures contribute to eﬀective word learning. Our results indicate that
children make use of
information from observing iconic gestures for
processing and encoding new lexical forms. Along with Capone Singleton
(), our results demonstrate that iconic gestures may help children
strengthen the links to the lexical form. In this way, watching iconic
gestures prompts rich encoding and makes word learning more eﬃcient.

Findings of a fast mapping study with TD children indicated that
arbitrary gestures might also beneﬁt word learning (Lüke & Ritterfeld,

). To address this issue, we conducted an additional experiment, this
time comparing iconic gestures to an equal number of arbitrary gestures.
The results revealed a numerical advantage for the iconic gestures, even
though the small sample size did not allow for detection of potential
eﬀects of this magnitude. Thus, the additional analysis suggests that the
diﬀerence in word learning may remain even when we compare iconic and
arbitrary gestures. Therefore,
it appears that it is the iconicity of the
gestures
than the
item-speciﬁc encoding of both auditory and visual information to a lexical
form, that helps learning. Further research is needed to substantiate these
ﬁndings and to determine in more detail which speciﬁc pieces of
information constitute the iconic gesture advantage.

iconic gesture

In addition, the ﬁnding that iconic gestures enhance word learning more
than attention-directing gestures do can be speciﬁed further with regard to
word class and stage of word learning. Our results show that iconic
gestures contributed to word learning at diﬀerent points in time. As we
paired learning nouns with shape gestures and verbs with combined
manner and path gestures, our results shed light on how readily accessible
diﬀerent
children. For
comprehension, children’s responses did not diﬀer with respect to word
class,
i.e. children learned both nouns and verbs better with iconic
gestures. For naming, as the more demanding task, the impact of iconic
gestures varied with regard to word class and test time. During initial
learning, children were better at naming verbs trained with iconic gestures
than verbs trained with attention-directing gestures, but there was no
advantage of either gesture type in noun naming. Conversely, during slow
mapping, children named nouns, but not verbs, better when trained with
iconic gestures. Thus, for naming during initial learning, the path–manner
gestures paired with verb learning caused the iconic advantage, whereas
for retention this advantage was due to the shape gestures used for noun
learning. Apparently,

movements has an immediate impact, while observing iconic shape

These results ﬁnd conﬁrmation in the recent literature. Research has
shown that recognizing iconicity in gesture types emerges at diﬀerent
points in time in development. While children at age two can learn from
iconic gestures that convey action information, it is only at age three that
they are able to recognize iconic gestures representing the shape properties
of objects (Hodges et al., ; Novack et al., ). Probably, iconic
gestures of actions provide multiple types of information and are more
closely aligned to the body than iconic shape gestures. Therefore, it might
be easier to map movement gestures onto actions, but cognitively more
demanding to map shape gestures onto objects (Hodges et al., ). Our

V O G T A N D K A U S C H K E

results support these ﬁndings, suggesting a diﬀerence in the timing of the
impact on word learning. Providing iconic movement gestures apparently
aids learning in the initial stage of word learning. In contrast,
iconic
gestures conveying shape information seem to particularly assist retention.
These ﬁndings are also in line with the results of Lüke and Ritterfeld
(), who showed that iconic shape gestures did not enhance word
learning at the fast mapping interval; only during slow mapping were
children able to beneﬁt from shape information.

To summarize: as predicted, our results demonstrate that observing iconic
co-speech gestures more eﬀectively enhances comprehension and naming of
new words than does observing attention-directing or arbitrary gestures.
Iconic gestures prompt richer encoding and make word learning more
eﬃcient for both the initial stage of learning and for retention of the
words. Moreover, expecting children to beneﬁt from iconic shape gestures
for noun learning and from iconic manner–path gestures for verb learning
proved true. However, these eﬀects manifest themselves in diﬀerent stages
of word learning. During the initial stage,
iconic gestures enhanced
performance in verb naming, while noun naming improved at the slow
mapping interval. Children make use of information provided by iconic
gestures to establish and strengthen the connections to the lexical form,
and this eﬀect diﬀers depending on the stage of word learning and word
class.

The role of iconic gestures in children with and without SLI
So far, we have shown that seeing iconic gestures improves word learning in
children with and without SLI. Do children with SLI derive a diﬀerential
(i.e. smaller or bigger) beneﬁt as is sometimes suggested? Evidence is not
uniform in this respect. Only one study compared word learning (at the
fast mapping interval) with iconic gestures in children with SLI and TD
children. Ellis Weismer and Hesketh () reported that comprehension
of both groups similarly improved. This is also true for the children in the
present study. Children of all groups (children with SLI,
language-
matched TD, and age-matched TD children) more eﬀectively beneﬁted
from iconic gestures for word learning than from attention-directing
gestures, for both comprehension and naming. The patterns of response
were similar across groups, and no particular beneﬁt for children with SLI
emerged. This is in line with a meta-analysis (Hostetter, ) which
found no evidence that gestures are more valuable for special populations
such as children with developmental disorders. Although considered a
special group of language learners, children with SLI are capable of
perceiving information in iconic gestures,
information
conveyed by gesture and speech, and to use this information for word

The results presented here have important implications for both research and
practice. Iconic gestures can be regarded as a suitable tool for teaching words
to children with and without SLI in clinical contexts and educational
settings. Shape gestures in particular qualify as a support for consolidation
of nouns. For verbs, it may be advisable to employ combined manner and
path gestures during the initial phase of learning. This study furthers our
knowledge on how iconic gestures support word learning in children with
and without SLI. Our ﬁndings help to attain a more diﬀerentiated
