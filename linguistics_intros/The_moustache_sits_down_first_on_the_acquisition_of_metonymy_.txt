Although speakers and addressees have a large repertoire of conventional
lexical meanings, they can go beyond these to communicate a seemingly
indeﬁnite number of context-dependent meanings. Metonymy is one case of
this, where an expression is used to refer to something that falls outside
its conventional denotation, with a clear associative relation linking the
conventional denotation and the contextually determined, metonymic one.
Consider Nunberg’s () classic example in ():

() The ham sandwich left without paying.
Uttered by one waiter to another in a restaurant, the expression the ham
sandwich refers to the customer who ordered the ham sandwich, and
exploits the immediate accessibility (or salience) of the associative
relation between the customer and his order. Another common case
is the use of names of artists or authors to refer to their works, as in
Woolf is on the top shelf. While such metonymic uses by adults are
common, little is known about how metonymy is understood or used by
children. Do young children understand the pragmatics of metonymy, and
do they use metonyms themselves? If so, when does this ability emerge in
development?
Children rely early on their pragmatic abilities in word learning, and are
sensitive to speaker intentions (Bloom, ), discourse status (Akhtar,
Carpenter & Tomasello, ), and speakers’ word choices (Clark, ).
Young children also make use of context in interpreting class extensions
(Bushnell & Maratsos, ), polysemy (Rabagliati, Marcus & Pylkkänen,
), and, under some conditions, metaphors (Özçaliskan, ) and
scalar terms (Papafragou & Musolino, ; but see also Noveck, ).
Does this early pragmatic skill extend to metonymy?

In this study, we investigate how three- to ﬁve-year-olds understand and
produce novel metonyms. We tested their ability to understand and
explain metonymic meanings in a comprehension task designed for
their level of world knowledge and linguistic skill. We also looked at their
ability to produce metonyms in two tasks. In the ﬁrst, we focused on their
use of metonymy as a shorthand device, and in the second, on its use in
naming animates based on a salient property. Evidence that young
children can manage metonymic meanings would support the view that
preschool children start to use ﬁgurative language early, along with some
of the relevant pragmatic inferences.
The pragmatics of metonymy.
We can distinguish between two kinds of metonymy: referential metonymy,
which relates one entity with another (e.g. The ham sandwich for ‘The
customer who ordered the ham sandwich’, as
in () above), and
propositional metonymy, which relates two propositions (e.g. The athlete
made it to the podium for ‘The athlete won a medal’) (Warren, ). In
this study, we focus on referential metonymy. The primary communicative
function of referential metonymy is usually taken to be that of
economizing on processing eﬀort in making a reference. On this view, a
metonym is a shorthand for a more elaborate expression, and the aim is
quick and easy referent identiﬁcation (Lakoﬀ & Johnson, ; Nunberg,
; Papafragou, ). Metonymy as a shorthand device diﬀers from
linguistic abbreviation (or ellipsis), where actual words are omitted (e.g.
uttering The Commons for The House of Commons), in that it picks out a
salient aspect of a referent to ‘stand for’ the referent as a whole, and is
therefore sometimes described as a form of “cognitive abbreviation”
(Nerlich & Clarke, , p. ). A metonymic shorthand of course also
involves a kind of linguistic abbreviation in the sense that, in most cases,
there exists a readily available paraphrase (e.g. The ham sandwich vs. The
customer who ordered the ham sandwich); however, it does not involve actual
linguistic ellipsis.

Referential metonymy is often described as a ‘regular’ process, where
metonymic expressions instantiate underlying patterns, either in the form
of stable conceptual associations (so-called ‘conceptual metonymy’; cf.
Lakoﬀ & Johnson, ; Radden & Kövecses, ) or even as the result
of some kind of (lexical) rule (Apresjan, ; Copestake & Briscoe, ;
Frisson & Pickering, ). For example, the metonymic relation
PRODUCER FOR PRODUCT is productive and makes it possible to understand
the utterance John likes to read Needham as referring to books written by
the author Needham, even though we might have never heard of this
author before (Frisson & Pickering, ). How are such metonymic
patterns acquired? And are children as sensitive to them as adults? Our
preliminary analyses of conversational interactions between children and
their caregivers from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, )
suggested that one productive metonymic pattern available to young
children is COMPONENT FOR GAME, linguistically realized as play NP, as in
Let’s play (the) zebras (‘the game that has zebras as a salient component’).
Metonymy, then, could well serve early on as a productive referential
strategy for young children.

While much has been said about metonymy as a shorthand referential
device in the theoretical literature, another communicative function of
referential metonymy has received less attention, namely its use to
highlight a particular property of the referent, thereby giving rise to a slight
(sometimes witty or playful) deprecation of the referent (e.g. The big mouth is
coming to the meeting). In these cases, referential metonymy serves as a
naming device, much as nicknames do, where a salient property of an
individual or object is used to create a new name (Papafragou, ).
While the use of (derogatory) metonymic nicknames (e.g. Four Eyes,
Chubby, Skinny Bones, etc.) is well documented among primary school
children (Crozier & Dimmock, ), little is known about its use among
preschoolers. Use of metonyms with a naming function might require
more metalinguistic ability than simple shorthand uses, since the speaker
replaces a conventional term with a new one to achieve a certain eﬀect.
Children’s metonymic skills.
In metonymy, salient associative relations (typically, relations of contiguity)
are exploited for the purpose of communication. The ability to identify such
relations is present early on. Categorization studies show that hierarchical
classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation of (part–whole) contiguity relations emerge
early in the preschool years (Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson &
Boyes-Braem, ). Also, many of children’s early referential strategies
exploit salient associative relations, and thus have an aﬃnity with
metonymy. Some iconic gestures made by infants bear a part–whole,
‘metonymic’ relation to the meaning represented, e.g. clapping hands for
‘baseball game’, smacking lips for ‘food’, and so on (Acredolo &
Goodwyn, ; Kendon, ; Mittelberg, ). This is also true of
some early referring expressions, e.g. onomatopoeias such as bow-wow for
‘dog’, and vroom-vroom for ‘vehicle’, and some strategies young children
use to ﬁll gaps in their vocabulary. For instance, overextensions based on
perceptual, spatio-temporal, and functional contiguity (e.g. toy for ‘a bag
which habitually contains toys’, cf. Huttenlocher & Smiley, ), could
be viewed as precursors to metonymy (Nerlich, Clarke & Todd, ).
Also, when children coin new words, one highly productive strategy they
rely on in English is zero-derivation, that is, the use of nouns as verbs
(e.g. to gun for ‘to shoot’). Children begin to rely on this option as young
as age two (Bushnell & Maratsos, ; Clark, ). These lexical
innovations appear to follow the ‘metonymic’ rule that almost any noun
denoting an object can be used as a verb for talking about some state,
process, or activity associated with that object (Clark & Clark, ;
Schönefeld, ). Another productive operation for coining nouns is
compounding, and young English-speaking children frequently construct
novel root compounds for subcategories (Clark, Gelman & Lane, ;
see also Konieczna & Kleparski, ), some of which could be
metonymically motivated (e.g. clown-boy for ‘the boy who is a clown’,
daddy-seed for ‘the seed that is a daddy’), highlighting a salient characteristic
of the entity in question. In short, since even very young children exploit
salient associative relations for the purpose of communication, the main
prerequisite for metonymy use appears to be present early on. Does
metonymy serve acommunicative function similar to other early
referential strategies attested in compensating for vocabulary gaps and/or
limited expressive ability?
Note that the notion of metonymy used throughout this paper is broader
than the one assumed by classical rhetoric, where the speaker is seen as
consciously ‘replacing’ a conventional, literal expression with a related
metonymic one. Instead, we follow contemporary pragmatic theory which,
drawing on theoretical arguments and evidence from psycholinguistic
studies, rejects such a sharp distinction between ﬁgurative and literal
utterances and proposes that ﬁgurative utterances, which arise naturally
and spontaneously for purposes of communication, exploit features that
also occur in a range of ordinary ‘literal’ utterances (Wilson & Sperber,
). In referential metonymy, the speaker exploits accessible associative
links in making a reference. In this way, a use of what we call a ‘referential
metonym’ would depend on the ability to recognize and make use of such
associative links in identifying a referent, but would not necessarily have
to involve knowledge of the conventional term for the intended referent
(though this would typically be the case in more sophisticated uses).

Figurative language development: metaphor and metonymy.
Most research on ﬁgurative language development has focused on children’s
ability to produce and understand metaphor (e.g. John is a lion), a matter of
debate for several decades (see Gibbs, , for a review). Earlier studies
observed that children tended to interpret metaphors literally, and
concluded that metaphor comprehension was a complex skill that did not
emerge until late in development (e.g. Asch & Nerlove, ; Billow,
; Winner, Rosenstiel & Gardner, ). Some researchers also
proposed that there is a ‘literal stage’ in ﬁgurative language development,
characterized by a tendency towards literal interpretations, before children
attain a more sophisticated level of ﬁgurative use (e.g. Levorato &
Cacciari, ; Winner, /). However, more recent studies suggest
that the lack of comprehension found in earlier studies of metaphor may
have resulted from the complexity of the tasks, and in fact attest to an
early metaphoric ability in both comprehension and production, emerging
during the preschool years
(see Deamer, ; Gottfried, ;
Özçalışkan, ; Pouscolous, ).

Few studies have explored children’s metonymic skill directly, and, to the
best of our knowledge, none has investigated preschoolers’ ability to produce
metonyms. In one comprehension study with a forced-choice task, Nerlich
et al. () found that four- and ﬁve-year-olds outperformed two- and
three-year-olds, but both groups did better when they received ‘clues’ that
made the association between the literal and metonymic reference explicit.
Another study compared comprehension of metonyms and metaphors with
conventional ﬁgurative meanings,
from age ﬁve to thirty-seven years
(Rundblad & Annaz, ). Overall performance improved with age, but
comprehension developed more slowly for metaphors than for metonyms.
This was interpreted as supporting the view that metonymy is more basic,
cognitively, than metaphor.
<Middle>
These studies.
raise a general methodological question: Were the
researchers in fact measuring vocabulary the children had already acquired
or their pragmatic skill with metonyms? When children acquire lexicalized
metonyms (e.g. Lego, where the name of the brand is used to refer to
the toy bricks), they do not necessarily make the association that renders
the metonym transparent; rather, the metonym could be acquired as a
conventional term for the referent in question – only later willthey
learn that Lego is a brand name. While understanding a novel metonym
requires pragmatic skill and relies on contextual knowledge to license the
metonymic association, comprehension of a lexicalized metonym may
simply depend on whether the child has already acquired its conventional
meaning.
A recent study investigated novel metonym and metaphor comprehension
and found that comprehension increased with age, with some metonyms and
metaphors understood even by the youngest participants, aged three (Van
Herwegen, Dimitriou & Rundblad, ). This suggests an
early-emerging pragmatic capacity for dealing with novel ﬁgurative
meanings, thus supporting recent results on metaphors. While providing
some insight into the metonymic ability of preschoolers, this study mainly
aimed at comparing the long-term developmental trajectories of novel
metonym and metaphor understanding in typically developing individuals
and individuals with Williams syndrome. To gain a clearer picture of
metonymic ability, we need research on preschoolers’ comprehension and
production of metonyms.
Hypotheses.
We began this research with the following expectations:

. Given the evidence of some early ﬁgurative language ability in young
children, we expected that, if children were presented with novel
metonyms in a context where the underlying association was
perceptually available and primed by the linguistic context, they should
be able to understand some novel metonyms. We also expected children
to get better at interpreting and explaining metonymic meanings with age
(Task ).

. Given their attested early ability to make use of salient associative
relations for communicative purposes, combined with some ﬁgurative
understanding, we expected children to be able to produce some
metonyms at an early age. Our ﬁrst elicitation task was designed to test
whether referential metonymy oﬀered children a strategy for referring
with shorthands rather than ‘more literal’, descriptive phrases that
might be more demanding syntactically or conceptually (Task ).
Metonymy might be a more economical alternative in planning terms,
by allowing children to seize on a salient property of the referent with
which to pick out the whole. Our second elicitation task focused on
referential metonymy with a naming function, testing whether young
children could create metonymic names for individuals based on salient
characteristics (Task ). Since metonymic naming might require more
metalinguistic skill, we expected that the ability to produce this kind of
referential metonymy would be acquired later. In this task, we also
looked at whether children were helped by exposure to examples of
common metonymic uses (e.g. PROPERTY FOR INDIVIDUAL).

E X P E R I M E N T A L T A S K S.
We collected data with three diﬀerent tasks from forty-seven children and
twenty-seven adults: the ﬁrst task tested metonymy comprehension, and
the second and third tested metonymy production. Each task was
presented as a game, so the study as a whole was perceived as a game
session by the children.

The children fell into three age groups:  three-year-olds (M = ;, SD =
;);  four-year-olds (M = ;, SD = ;); and  ﬁve-year-olds (M = ;,
SD = ;). Half the children in each group were female, half male. The
children were from largely middle- to upper-class families, ethnically
representative of the population in the Bay Area of Northern California,
and all were acquiring English as a ﬁrst language.

The adults were twenty-seven native English-speaking undergraduates at
Stanford University. Half were female, half male. They received class
credit for their participation.

TASK 

The goal of the ﬁrst task was to ﬁnd out whether three-, four-, and
ﬁve-year-olds understand novel metonyms, and whether they can reason
verbally about their meanings. Unlike earlier studies (Nerlich et al., ;
Rundblad & Annaz, ; but cf. Van Herwegen, et al., ), we relied
on novel metonyms based on part–whole relations, with a salient physical
property used to make reference to a person. By using novel metonyms,
we avoided the problem of determining whether a metonymic
interpretation signalled actual understanding or simply prior acquisition of
a conventional meaning. We used a forced-choice story task with pictures,
where the metonyms were all transparent in that they depended on
perceptually available information. The contextual information needed to
make a correct metonymic interpretation was immediately accessible, so
comprehension did not require activation of any background knowledge.
We therefore expected some metonyms to be understood by even the
youngest children, and a general increase in metonymic skill with age.
We also asked children to explain their choices. We expected that the
ability to reason about metonymic meanings would improve with age, but
that this kind of reﬂection might emerge later than comprehension itself,
as has been shown for children’s explanations of metaphorical meanings
(Özçalışkan, ).

Materials.
The stimuli consisted of ten sets of four pictures, each set presented in two
steps. First, the experimenter showed a large picture (see Figure ) that
introduced a scenario involving two or more people, one of whom had
a salient characteristic, e.g. a pair of giant ears, a brightly coloured hat, a
bicycle helmet, etc. While showing the picture, the experimenter told a
short story, the last part of which contained the target sentence
mentioning the salient property. In the metonymic condition, the target
referred metonymically to the bearer of the property, as in ():
() This story is about these two girls. They are standing outside talking
before going home from work. After they have been talking for a
while, the helmet gets on her bike and rides home.

In the literal condition, the target referred directly to the property itself,
as in ():

() This story is about these two women. They are doing the dishes. It gets
very hot in the kitchen, so the bright jacket is placed on a chair.

The linguistic context of the stories supported the intended – metonymic or
literal – reading. Next, the experimenter showed three small pictures,
close-ups of each individual in the story and the salient property by itself
(see Figure ), and children had to choose the matching picture from this set.
The pictures were taken by the ﬁrst two authors, colour printed, and
plasticized. One set was used in a warm-up trial, and the remaining nine
sets in experimental trials. The experimental items consisted of six
metonymic stories and three literal stories.
Procedure.
The task was presented as a game and took about  minutes to complete.
The child was ﬁrst shown the warm-up picture set, followed by the other
nine. Order of presentation was randomized across subjects and ages. For
each picture set, the experimenter told the child a story while showing the
ﬁrst picture (Figure ). After the ﬁnal, target sentence, the experimenter
asked the child to pick out the picture (from the next three) that matched
the story. The child had the following choices:

Figure a: The bearer of the property (i.e. the metonymic referent).
Figure b: The property by itself (i.e. the literal referent).
Figure c: Another participant in the story (i.e. a distractor).

R E S U L T S
The participants’ answers to the nine forced-choice questions were treated as
a categorical variable and coded as METONYMIC reading, LITERAL reading, or
DISTRACTOR. Since children chose the distractor in only a small number of
cases (% in the metonymic condition, % in the literal condition), we
discarded these responses in subsequent analyses.

Figure  presents the percentages of METONYMIC and LITERAL readings in

the two conditions by age (three, four, ﬁve, and adult).

Metonymic and literal conditions.
Using SPSS, we analyzed the data using logistic regression, which is more
appropriate for categorical data than ANOVA (see Jaeger, ). Adults
were not included in the logistic regression analyses given their ceiling
performance in both conditions (cf. Figure ) and the absence of variance
in their responses.

We examined comprehension of the target items as a function of the
predictor variables age (three vs. four vs. ﬁve, with three as the baseline)
and condition (metonymic vs. literal, with metonymic as the baseline).
To examine age diﬀerences in comprehension in the two conditions, we
included an interaction term between age and condition. The analysis
revealed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of age (p = ·) and a signiﬁcant
interaction between age and condition (p < ·). First, in measuring the
eﬀect of age at baseline, we observed that, compared with three-year-olds,
four-year-olds were less likely to choose METONYMIC readings of
metonymic targets (B = –·, OR = ·, p = ·, % CI [·, ·]), and
ﬁve-year-olds even less so (B = –·, OR = ·, p = ·, % CI [·,
·]), In other words, there was a decrease in the number of correct
METONYMIC readings, and an increase in the number of wrong LITERAL
readings, from age three to ﬁve.
Second, to examine age diﬀerences within the literal condition, we ran an
additional logistic regression with the same dependent and predictor
variables as before but with literal as the baseline for condition. This
analysis also showed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of age on comprehension
(p = ·). Compared with three-year-olds, both four-year-olds (B = ·,
OR = ·, p = ·, % CI [·, ·]) and ﬁve-year-olds (B = ·, OR
= ·, p = ·, % CI [·, ·]) were more likely to provide a
correct interpretation for a literal target (although the eﬀect was only
marginally significant for the four-year-olds), and comprehension
improved with age. This trend is the inverse of that observed in the
metonymic condition, where the youngest children outperformed the
older ones.
Comparison of the two conditions.
A simple logistic regression analysis of the eﬀect of condition (metonymic vs.
literal) on the dependent variable type of reading (METONYMIC vs. LITERAL)
showed a clear eﬀect of condition on type of reading (p < ·), with
children overall being more likely to choose a METONYMIC reading in the
metonymic condition than in the literal condition (B = ·, OR = ·,
% CI [·, ·]). This suggests some early understanding of novel
metonymy among children aged three to ﬁve. However, the signiﬁcant
interaction between age and condition (p < ·) showed that age aﬀected
comprehension in both conditions. First, we observed that condition had
no eﬀect on three-year-olds’ comprehension of target items (p = ·),
which suggests that they did not ﬁnd the metonyms harder than the literal
items. Second, the interaction analysis showed a clear eﬀect of condition
for four-year-olds (Interaction odds ratio (IOR) = ·/· = ·), who
were about ﬁve times as likely to give correct answers in the literal than in
the metonymic condition, and a large effect on ﬁve-year-olds’
comprehension in the two conditions (IOR = ·/· = ·). This
group was about seventeen times more likely to provide a correct answer
in the literal condition compared to the metonymic condition. Thus,
children appeared to have more diﬃculty with novel metonyms as they
got older.

Explaining their answers.
Next, we examined the explanations children gave for their choices in the
metonymic condition. Adults were excluded from this analysis as well,
given their ceiling performance. Children’s explanations of their correct
interpretations of novel metonyms fell into three categories:
. A RELEVANT explanation demonstrated clear understanding. This could
involve making the association between person and property explicit
(e.g. Because the girl has a helmet), substituting the metonymic for the
literal referent, suggesting that the child had made the relevant
association (e.g. Cause she’s about to ride home), or rejecting the literal
content of the target sentence (e.g. Cause the moustache is sitting down
ﬁrst. [Pointing to the literal referent]: Not this one, where the moustache is
sitting down alone.).
. A SEMI-RELEVANT explanation involved repetition of the metonym (e.g.
Cause that’s the big beard) or a paraphrase of the target sentence.
. An IRRELEVANT explanation was uninformative as to whether the child had
understood the metonym (e.g. Cause it’s pretty). We also included in this
category cases in which children provided no answer.

Where children had given a wrong literal interpretation of the novel
metonym, we divided their explanations into three additional categories:
. ACCEPTANCE included what seemed to be straightforward acceptance of the
literal meaning (e.g. Cause the helmet is on the bike riding home).

. EXPLICIT COMMENT was for cases where the child chose the literal
interpretation but commented on its absurdity (e.g. But the helmet can’t
ride a bike!) and/or on what the speaker had actually ‘said’ (e.g. Cause
this one has the helmet, you didn’t say the person with the helmet).

. IRRELEVANT answers were uninformative or irrelevant explanations (e.g.
Cause that’s the right picture), as well as those cases where children
provided no answer.

To check inter-rater agreement, the ﬁrst two authors coded  explanations
randomly selected from the children’s explanations for Task . They were
unaware of the child’s age when coding the answers. We used Fleiss’
kappa (Fleiss, ), measured using the irr package in R: κ = ·.
According to Landis and Koch (), a κ value above · indicates
almost perfect agreement.

The percentages of children’s explanation types are presented in Tables 
and . Table  shows that for metonymic interpretations, all ages tended to
oﬀer RELEVANT explanations. A simple logistic regression analysis of the
eﬀect of age (three-year-olds vs. four-year-olds and ﬁve-year-olds) on the
production of RELEVANT explanations was signiﬁcant (p < ·). Compared
(B = ·, OR = ·,
with the three-year-olds, both four-year-olds
p < ·, % CI [·, ·]) and ﬁve-year-olds (B = ·, OR = ·,
p < ·, % CI [·, ·]) were more likely to produce explanations
of this type. However, an additional simple logistic regression analysis,
with the same predictor and dependent variables but using ﬁve-year-olds
as the baseline category for age, showed that the diﬀerence between the
four-year-olds and the ﬁve-year-olds was not signiﬁcant (p = ·).



Inversely, there was a decrease in IRRELEVANT explanations with age
for correct metonymic interpretations. A simple logistic regression
showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect of age on this explanation type (p < ·), with
four-year-olds (B = –·, OR = ·, p = ·, % CI [·,
·]) and ﬁve-year-olds (B = –·, OR = ·, p = ·, % CI·])
signiﬁcantly less likely to provide IRRELEVANT explanations than
three-year-olds. A similar age eﬀect was found for IRRELEVANT
explanations of literal interpretations (see Table ), with three-year-olds
more likely than the other two age groups to provide such explanations
(three-year-olds vs. four-year-olds: B = –·, OR = ·, p = ·, % CI
[·, ·], three-year-olds vs. ﬁve-year-olds: B = –·, OR = ·, p = ·,
% CI [·, ·]).

Finally, a simple logistic regression showed an eﬀect of age on the
production of EXPLICIT COMMENTS for literal interpretations of metonyms
(p = ·), with ﬁve-year-olds more likely to produce explanations of this
type than three-year-olds (B = ·, OR = ·, p = ·, % CI [·,
,]). However, three-year-olds and four-year-olds did not diﬀer here
(p = ·).

D I S C U S S I O N
Overall, these results show that children as young as three appear able to
understand novel metonyms when the context makes the association
transparent, but that, contrary to expectation, children did less well as
they got older. Our results also show that their reasoning about metonymy
improves with age, although only for those children within each group
who interpreted the metonyms correctly.
All the children had some way to go to attain adult levels of understanding.
Compared with adults, always correct in both conditions, children overall
provided contextually appropriate metonymic interpretations only
about half the time. Still, they provided signiﬁcantly more metonymic
interpretations for metonyms than for literal items. And their explanations
for correct interpretations show that, in most cases, their answers did
indeed signal understanding. However, the four- and ﬁve-year-olds
appeared to ﬁnd literal items easier to understand than metonyms.
Children’s growing preference for literal interpretations appeared, at ﬁrst,
quite puzzling. What could cause three-year-olds’ performance to be closer
to that of adults than to that of children only a year or two older? A
‘U-shaped’ development has been observed in several cognitive domains
(e.g. Karmiloﬀ-Smith, ). One well-known example comes from the
acquisition of morphology, where children use correct irregular forms,
then over-regularize them, and ﬁnally produce the correct forms, as in the
verb went > goed > went in English (Bowerman, ; Ervin, ). This
has been hypothesized to be part of the process of developing the
underlying cognitive representational systems involved, so that, despite
adult-like performance, the youngest children rely on strategies diﬀerent
from those of adults. Let’s suppose that in metonymy comprehension,
three-year-olds are using a pragmatic interpretive strategy that is ‘naively
optimistic’ (Sperber, ) in the sense that they take the ﬁrst appropriate
interpretation that comes to mind in context to be the one intended by the
speaker. This might involve seizing on anything that allows identiﬁcation
of a referent (e.g. the helmet, the moustache, etc.), based on the
contextually available associative link between the property and its bearer.
This interpretation would be the most accessible, least eﬀortful one that, at
the same time, brings about a satisfactory result (i.e. it is ‘relevant’ in
Sperber and Wilson’s terms, /): in the present case, it would
match the story, be compatible with what children know about the world,
allow further inferences about what will happen next, and so on. Children
who use such a naively optimistic strategy will accept the outcome as a
good enough interpretation of the speaker’s intended meaning. In the
metonymic condition, where the context supported the metonymic
interpretation, there would often be overlap between the meaning arrived
at via a naive interpretation strategy and the one intended by the speaker.
Our data provide some evidence that the youngest children were indeed
employing such a strategy: three-year-olds hesitated much less than older
children in making their interpretations. So even though they were often
successful in their interpretations of novel metonyms, the three-year-olds
could have been using a diﬀerent interpretive strategy in which they went
immediately for the ﬁrst interpretation that was accessible and relevant.
Adults, however, are likely to have used a more sophisticated strategy, in
which they inferred that the speaker plausibly intended them to identify
the metonymic referent on the basis of her utterance, the contextually
available associative link between the property and its bearer, and the
contextual evidence provided by the story (i.e. they were ‘sophisticated
understanders’ in Sperber’s terms, ).

One possible objection here might be that rather than identifying referents
on the basis of metonymic associations, the three-year-olds were using some
kind of primitive interpretation strategy where people are treated as agents
by default, so they always chose a person as the intended referent. But
notice that most children picked the person with (not the one without) the
salient property, which shows that something more than a person-
as-default-agent strategy must be in play. It is possible that the property-
for-person pattern could be one of the earliest forms of metonymy
proper to emerge in young children because of the prototypical mapping
of people and agents. This also underlies adult uses of this metonymic
pattern.
As an explanation of the older children’s tendency to choose literal
interpretations of novel metonyms, we propose that it could be a
by-product of their growing metalinguistic awareness – their ability to
reﬂect on language and its use (Gombert, ; Karmiloﬀ-Smith, ;
Tunmer, Pratt & Herriman, ). Metalinguistic awareness is clearly
present in four-year-olds (Doherty & Perner, ). They recognize that
words are objects in themselves, and have meanings that can be abstracted
from contexts. For instance, it is at age four to ﬁve that children show
some delight in responding to indirect requests like Can you open the
window? with Yes and a smile. This metalinguistic awareness could play a
role in distinguishing between what is said (literal) and what is
communicated (pragmatic), an ability that has been found to emerge
around the same age (Vosniadou & Orthony, ). This might lead
children to overemphasize literal meanings, and so result in the literal
preference we observed. There is some support for this in children’s
explanations in the metonymic condition: the older children, ﬁve-year-olds
in particular, frequently hesitated between a literal and a metonymic
answer. Furthermore, they sometimes commented explicitly on the literal
content of the utterance with the metonym, usually with reference to its
nonsensicality (Girl (;): “Because the glasses are reading. [Laughs].
Glasses can’t read.”), or referred back to what the experimenter had
actually said in her utterance (Boy (;): “Cause the giant ears are going to
drive. That’s what you said.”). This type of explicit reﬂection was almost
entirely absent in three-year-olds.

The literal bias shown by older children, then, could be due, not to an
inability to understand novel metonyms, but to a conﬂict between two
highly activated interpretations, one focused on linguistic meaning, the
other on speaker meaning – a conﬂict that will eventually be resolved as
children’s linguistic and pragmatic abilities mature further. So the
outcome here, where children’s metalinguistic reﬂection leads to a wrong
result, gives the impression of poorer metonymic skill
in the older children, while they are in reality attending to a larger picture than the
younger children. Note also that in the metonymic condition,
metonymic interpretation should be easier to derive than the literal one: in
context, the perceptually available association between the property and its
bearer, combined with children’s knowledge of the world, should make it
more accessible, which could explain why three-year-olds did well. In this
way, the four- and ﬁve year olds might be using a more ‘cautious’
interpretation strategy (Sperber, ), in which they are able to take into
account that the speaker might have misjudged what would be most
accessible or relevant to them. At the same time, their reﬂections on literal
sentence meaning might have caused them to lose track of what the
speaker might plausibly have intended to convey by her utterance.
It is tempting to ask whether this possible conﬂict between literal and
speaker meanings is what earlier studies of metaphor comprehension
tapped into, concluding that children are unable to understand metaphors
(e.g. Asch & Nerlove, ; Billow, ; Winner et al., ), and
whether their results might have been diﬀerent had they tested children
under age four.
Another factor that might have inﬂuenced the ﬁve-year-olds’ literal
answers is their ability to work with story worlds. By age ﬁve, children
have usually seen many cartoons (e.g. Dora the Explorer) and are willing to
accept that characteristics of the world they know can be violated. How
this story world ability might interact with ﬁgurative language skills in
forming hypotheses about speaker-intended meanings, though, remains an
issue for further investigation.

Our ﬁnding that children’s explanations of novel metonymic meanings
improved with age for those children who provided correct metonymic
interpretations, with four- and ﬁve-year-olds demonstrating metonymic
understanding in their explanations signiﬁcantly more often than
three-year-olds, is consistent with previous ﬁndings on children’s ability to
put metaphorical meanings into words (Keil, ; Özçalışkan, ;
Stites & Özçalışkan, ). Although the older children chose metonymic
interpretations less often than the younger ones, they demonstrated more
explicit understanding of metonymy.
There was also a decrease with age in irrelevant explanations for correct
interpretations of  the metonyms. However, an irrelevant explanation
should not be seen as evidence for a lack of understanding, given that
understanding usually precedes the ability to paraphrase or explain
(Özçalışkan, ; Vosniadou, ; Winner, Engel & Gardner, ). We
found the same pattern for literal interpretations of novel metonyms. Not
only does children’s ability to reason about metonymic meanings improve,
but their metalinguistic ability allows for more explicit reﬂection on both
linguistic and communicated meanings overall.

TASK 

Our second and third tasks focused on whether three- to five-year-olds
can produce referential metonyms, and, if so, whether these include
metonyms with both shorthand and naming functions. Task  focused on
referential metonyms used as shorthands, and looked at whether
metonymy offers a useful referential strategy for children in place of fuller
referring expressions that might be more demanding syntactically and/or
conceptually.
As our analysis of the CHILDES corpus revealed, play NP (giving rise to
the metonymic relation COMPONENT FOR GAME) appears as a productive
pattern by age three, e.g. “I was playing cherry” (;, CHILDES,
Eng-USA/Weist/emi.cha). We find the play NP pattern both in
children’s speech and adults’ child-directed speech, e.g. “You like to play
zebras?” (;, CHILDES, Eng-USA/Weist/ben.cha). We made use of
this pattern to test whether preschoolers could produce a metonym as
shorthand to refer to a game for which they did not know the name
(play-context), or whether they would prefer to use a fuller, more ‘literal’,
descriptive phrase. As before, we were concerned with whether children
could come up with novel metonyms given an appropriate context.
We expected younger children to produce more metonyms and fewer
descriptions than older children and adults. Since their expressive abilities
are less developed, use of metonyms as shorthands might be particularly
useful as a communicative strategy early on.

M E T H O D.
Materials.
We designed two pairs of simple games using familiar objects:
Set : Straws. The player had to put one straw inside a plastic glass, then
two straws inside a second glass, and so on, and ﬁll as many glasses as
possible in  seconds. Marbles. The player had  seconds to iteratively
place a glass upside down and a marble on top to build the largest
possible tower.
Set : Magnets. The player was given several small magnets and a large
black magnet board, and had  seconds to stick as many magnets on
the board as possible. Stickers. The player was given several small
stickers and a sheet of paper, and had  seconds to place as many
stickers on the paper as possible.
Procedure.
The task, presented as a game, took about  minutes to complete. The
experimenter started by saying Now you get to choose which game we play.
I have two games for you to choose from. Let me show you what they are.
Children were shown the two games of a set, one after the other. The
experimenter did not name the games, but gave each child the instructions
for playing them, demonstrating with the objects involved (In the ﬁrst
game, you get to use a board and some magnets. You have  seconds to put
as many magnets on the board as you can. In the other game, you get to use
paper and some stickers. You have  seconds to put as many stickers on the
paper as you can). Then she put the two games out of sight and asked
Which of the two games would you like to play?, in this way forcing the
child to come up with a referring expression for one of the games. After
letting the child play the game chosen, the experimenter asked if the child
wanted to play the second game (So, do you want to play the other game
too?), to which the child always answered aﬃrmatively. The experimenter
then asked the child to tell her which one it was (Which one did you want
to play?), and so elicited a referring expression for the second game too.
The same procedure was followed for the second pair of games.

The same procedure was followed with adults, but they were told that the
task was aimed at children and that they did not have to actually play the
games if they did not want to.
R E S U L T S.
We classiﬁed the four referring expressions produced by each participant
into one of the following types:

i. METONYM (e.g. the stickers, the marbles)
ii. COMPOUND (e.g. the sticker game, the marble one)
iii. DESCRIPTION (e.g. the game with the stickers, the game where you time me for

the marbles)

iv. OTHER (e.g. don’t know)
v. NA (if the participant did not give any answer)

As in Task , the ﬁrst two authors rated a random set of  answers to
check inter-rater agreement, and obtained a high value: κ = ·. The NA
cases, which amounted to % of the sample, were treated as missing data
and excluded from the overall analysis. However, we observed that, with a
few exceptions, three-year-olds were responsible for most NAs, suggesting
that this age group had more diﬃculty than the others. Some of the
youngest children seemed to ﬁnd it hard to remember the game presented
as the ﬁrst of the two in each set, especially after playing the other
(second) game.
The dependent variable of answer type was treated in two ways in the
analyses. In order to investigate our hypothesis that metonymy might be a
particularly useful referential strategy for children, as well as our
expectation that younger children would produce more metonyms and
fewer descriptions than the older children and adults, we first treated each
individual answer type (METONYM, COMPOUND, and DESCRIPTION) as a
dichotomous variable, and analyses were performed using logistic
regression. Then, in order to compare the production of answer types
(METONYM, COMPOUND, and DESCRIPTION) between ages (three, four, five,
plus adults), we treated answer type as a multilevel categorical variable,
with analyses performed using multinomial regression.
In the first, logistic regression analyses we examined the differences in age
for each answer type (see Table ). We started by investigating production of
METONYMS as a function of age (three, four, five, and adults), with
three-year-olds as the baseline for age. The analysis revealed no significant
differences between three-year-olds and the other age groups (p = ·).
For COMPOUNDS, there was a significant effect of age (p = ·), with
five-year-olds less likely to produce COMPOUNDS than three-year-olds (B = –
·, OR = ·, p = ·, % CI [·, ·]). However, four-year-olds (p
= ·) and adults (p = ·) did not differ from three-year-olds. Finally,
for DESCRIPTIONS, we found a significant effect of age (p = ·), with
five-year-olds (B = ·, OR = ·, p = ·, % CI [·, ·]) and
adults (B = ·, OR = ·, p = ·, % CI [·, ·]) more likely to
produce DESCRIPTIONS than three-year-olds. Four-year-olds, however, did
not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from three-year-olds (p = ·).
age on the dependent variable of answer type (METONYM, COMPOUND,
and DESCRIPTION), with METONYM as the baseline, and the productions
of four-year-olds, five-year-olds, and adults against those of the
three-year-olds (METONYMS: %, COMPOUNDS: %, and DESCRIPTIONS:
%). (OTHER answers were removed due to the zero values for adults,
four-year-olds, and five-year-olds.) For COMPOUNDS vs. METONYMS, there
were no significant differences at any age, although five-year-olds tended
to produce fewer COMPOUNDS than METONYMS compared with
three-year-olds (B = –·, OR = ·, p = , % CI [·, ·]). For
DESCRIPTIONS vs. METONYMS, adults were about three times as likely to
produce DESCRIPTIONS over METONYMS compared with three-year-olds (B =
·, OR = ·, p = ·, % CI [·, ·]), but the comparisons
between three- and four-year-olds (p = ·) and three- and five-year-olds
(p = ·) were not significant.
DISCUSSION.
These results support use of the form play NP as a productive metonymic
pattern for both children and adults. More generally, the results support
the view that preschoolers (and adults) use metonyms, that is, shorthand
referential expressions based on associative conceptual links, in referring to
things in the world around them.
Children’s reliance on metonyms rather than compound nouns or
descriptions in the play-context suggests that this pattern might be
particularly useful to them as a referential strategy, compared to adults,
who showed no preference for any one strategy over another. While there
were no age differences in children’s preference for metonyms, our results
support the expectation that younger children would produce fewer
descriptions than the older children and adults. Could it be that metonymy is
more important as a referential strategy in the earlier stages of language
acquisition, when children’s vocabulary and expressive abilities are more
limited? Notice that a metonym in the form of a noun phrase is simpler
than a full descriptive phrase syntactically, and, perhaps, conceptually as
well, being less costly in terms of short-term memory or planning for
speaking.

One objection here might be that it is the conventionality of the play NP
pattern that is responsible for the metonyms produced, rather than this
reﬂecting a preference for metonymy as a referential device more generally.
But even if play NP were stored as a linguistic unit in the child’s memory
(cf. Arnon & Snider, ), its use still requires the ability to pick out a
salient feature of a game and use that to identify the game as a whole – in
other words, it requires some metonymic ability.
The finding that the younger children produced more compounds to name
the games is consistent with previous work on children’s use of novel root
compounds (e.g. Clark et al., ). In the play-context, their noun–noun
compounds could also be analyzed as metonymic (cf. Konieczna &
Kleparski, ), since the children used, as the referent of the modifier
noun in the compound, a part of the game that they found salient or that
they could remember easily (e.g. the sticker game). Our results reveal for
the first time that in addition to the well-documented process of
compounding, metonymy offers young children another option for
referring to entities for which they lack a conventional term. This also
shows the close relationship that exists between metonymy and noun–noun
compounding: both processes are based on the exploitation of salient
associative relations and may serve similar communicative functions
(Wilson & Falkum, ).
TASK 
Our third task was designed to further explore children’s ability to produce
metonyms. This time we used an open naming task and focused on
metonyms with a naming function. Our goal was to see whether children
were willing to take a salient property of an individual (person, animal,
fantasy creature) and use it to create a new, metonymic label for that
entity (e.g. The Long Nose, The Funny Hat, Big Eyes, etc.). In addition,
we wanted to see whether children were sensitive to the presence of a
metonymic pattern (e.g. PROPERTY FOR INDIVIDUAL) in their productions.
The regularity of metonymy, claimed to derive from such metonymic
patterns, has been taken to be one of its distinctive features (Apresjan,
). While some have appealed to patterns of underlying conceptual
associations, so-called ‘conceptual metonymies’ (Lakoﬀ & Johnson, ;
Radden & Kövecses, ), others have appealed to (lexical) rules of sense
extension (Copestake & Briscoe, ; Frisson & Pickering, ).
Regardless of whether such metonymic patterns are seen as part of the
conceptual or the linguistic system, one question is how they are acquired,
and whether children are as sensitive to them as adults.

As in Task , we expected children to be able to produce at least some
metonyms, but that, given the higher demands of metonymic naming on
the child’s abilities, this strategy might be more accessible to the older
children than to the younger ones. Given adults’ sensitivity to metonymic
patterns (Frisson & Pickering, ), we also expected participants to
produce more metonyms when exposed to a target pattern. Finally, if
metonymy is available as a naming strategy for young children, we
wondered whether they would be more likely to produce metonyms when
shown unfamiliar types, namely fantasy creatures, for which they lacked a
conventional label, than when they were presented with familiar types,
namely people and real animals.

M E T H O D.
Materials.
We selected a total of eighteen digital pictures from the Web. Each one
depicted an individual (a person, a real animal, or fantasy creature) with a
distinctive property. The individuals were of either familiar (persons, real
animals) or unfamiliar (fantasy creatures) types. In one condition, we used
three additional pictures to introduce examples of the metonymic pattern
PROPERTY FOR INDIVIDUAL (a cat with a hat, a horse with its mane on ﬁre,
and a man with a large moustache). The experimenter called them The
Winter Hat, The Fire, and The Moustache, respectively. The pictures were
presented on an Apple MacBook computer screen.
Procedure.
Just as before, the task was presented to the children in the form of a game
that took around  minutes to complete. The children were divided into two
even groups. Subjects in the ﬁrst group were shown one of the pictures on
the computer, occupying the entire screen, and asked to help the
experimenter come up with a name for the person or animal on display.
The experimenter ﬁrst asked: Can you help me ﬁnd names for my friends?
What would you call him/her/it? Then the pictures were displayed one at
a time. The task was identical for subjects in the second group except that
they were ﬁrst given three examples of possible names that exempliﬁed
the metonymic pattern PROPERTY FOR INDIVIDUAL (e.g. The Moustache).
The order of presentation of the pictures was randomized across subjects
and ages. The same procedure was followed for the adults.
R E S U L T S.
We classiﬁed the names produced by the children and adults into one of the
following types:

i. METONYM (e.g. Black Lips, The Hat)
ii. COMPOUND (e.g. Scarf Cat, The Blanket Girl)
iii. DESCRIPTION (e.g. Duck With Shoes On, The Flying Magic Horse)
iv. PROPER NAME (e.g. Laura, Arie)
v. OTHER (e.g. Merengue, Tata)
vi. NA (if the participant did not give any answer)

As in Tasks  and , the ﬁrst two authors rated a random set of  answers
to check inter-rater agreement, and obtained a high value: κ = ·.

Table  presents the percentages of each answer type produced in Task ,
by age. Both children’s and adults’ metonymic names were creative and
diverse (e.g. “Yellow Eyes”, “Fat Moustache”, “Black Lips”, “The
Hotdog Hat”, “The Snow-Scarf”, etc.). The NA cases, % of the sample,
were treated as missing data and excluded from the overall analysis.
As in Task , the dependent variable of answer type was treated in two
ways in the analyses. In order to investigate any age differences in
metonymic namings, we first focused only on the participants’ METONYM
answers, which we treated as a dichotomous variable and analyzed using
logistic regression. Then, in order to compare the production of
metonymic names against that of other answer types, we treated answer
type as a multilevel categorical variable, which we analysed using
multinomial regression.
In the first, logistic regression analysis, we examined the dependent
variable of METONYM production as a function of the predictor variables
age (with three-year-olds as the baseline), examples (yes vs. no), and
familiarity of the individual depicted (familiar vs. unfamiliar). To compare
children’s sensitivity to the metonymic pattern with that of adults, we
included an interaction term between age and examples in the analysis.
The analysis revealed a significant main effect of age (p < ·) and a
significant interaction between age and examples (p < ·). First,
measuring the effect of age in the no-example condition, we observed a
developmental trend in the children towards a higher production of
METONYMS with age, with four-year-olds about four times (B = ·, OR =
·, p < ·, % CI [·,·]) and five-year-olds about five times (B =
·, OR = ·, p < ·, % CI [·, ·]) more likely to produce
METONYMS than three-year-olds. However, the production of METONYMS
among adults in this condition did not differ significantly from that of the
three-year-olds (p = ·). Second, we observed a clear effect of examples
on three-year-olds’ METONYM productions (B = ·, OR = ·, p < ·,
% CI [·, ·]). The interaction analysis further showed a large effect
of examples on adult’s METONYM production (IOR = ·/· = ·), but
no eﬀect on either four- (IOR = ·/· = ·) or ﬁve-year-olds (IOR =
·/· = ·). Finally, the analysis revealed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of
familiarity (B = ·, OR = ·, p < ·, % CI [·, ·]), with
participants producing more METONYMS for familiar types (persons and
real animals) than for unfamiliar ones (fantasy creatures).

In the second, multinomial logistic regression analysis, we investigated the
eﬀects of the predictor variables of age, example, and familiarity on the
dependent variable of answer type (METONYM, COMPOUND, DESCRIPTION,
PROPER NAME, OTHER), with METONYM as the baseline category. The
baselines for the predictors were identical to those in the logistic regression
analysis. The answers for each age group were compared against those of
three-year-olds (cf. Table ). Table  summarizes the results.
Not surprisingly, whether the participant was given examples first
significantly affected their production of all answer types (except OTHER:
p = ·), with the largest effect observed for PROPER NAMES (OR = ·),
with an increase in OR of · in the absence of exposure to examples.
Table  also shows significant age effects on some answer types. For
COMPOUNDS, we observed a tendency for five-year-olds to produce more
than three-year-olds did (OR = ·, p = ·), but there were no
significant differences by age groups. Three-year-olds were significantly
more likely to produce DESCRIPTIONS than five-year-olds (OR = ·) and
adults (OR = ·), but did not differ significantly from four-year-olds
(p = ·). Similarly, five-year-olds (OR = ·) and adults (OR = ·)
produced fewer proper names than three-year-olds, but there were no
significant differences between three- and four-year-olds (p = ·). The
familiarity of the depicted individual predicted the production of
COMPOUNDS and DESCRIPTIONS, with participants being less likely to
produce COMPOUNDS (OR = ·) or DESCRIPTIONS (OR = ·) than
METONYMS when the referents were familiar types.
It should be noted that, due to the division of each age group, the number
of subjects was quite small in this task. However, we had repeated
observations and the number of valid observations was large (n =  in
the no-example condition, n =  in the example condition). Since our
p-values were generally small (<·) for the majority of the statistically
signiﬁcant predictor variables, the conclusions drawn are likely to be well
founded, but our ﬁndings should be viewed as preliminary.

D I S C U S S I O N.
The results from Task  provide further support for the view that
preschoolers can produce referential metonyms, in this case metonymic
names based on salient properties for animate beings. The results also
show that prior exposure to examples of a metonymic pattern affects the
number of metonyms adults produce. For children, though, only
the three-year-olds, but not the four- or five-year-olds, appeared to be
influenced by the examples given. Also, contrary to our expectations,
unfamiliar types of referents did not increase metonym production. In
fact, familiar types proved more likely to elicit metonyms than unfamiliar
ones, which were in turn associated with a greater likelihood of
compounds and descriptions.
Overall, participants produced metonyms about one-third of the time in
Task . This number needs to be considered in the light of the variety of
possible terms that could apply to any one type of individual, and the fact
that this was an open-ended task, especially in the no-example condition.
Metonymy, then, is clearly available as a productive labelling strategy for
both preschoolers and adults.
In this task, age was a significant predictor of metonym production, with
older children producing more metonymic names. Unlike the shorthands
elicited in Task , which required the ability to represent and exploit a
part-for-whole relation in making a reference, the metonymic names
produced here required a higher degree of metalinguistic ability, taking a
familiar term as a new name for an individual. The greater production of
metonymic names by four- and five-year-olds compared with the
three-year-olds when given no examples is consonant with the emergence
of certain metalinguistic skills around age four (Doherty & Perner, ).
Exposure to examples of a metonymic pattern had an effect only on
three-year-olds (and adults), but not on the older children: this was
unexpected. But note that the age differences found for the interaction
between age and examples pattern with those found in Task , where
three-year-olds also looked more like adults than did the older children.
One explanation could be that the three-year-olds chose the first terms
that came to mind, without reflection, so the examples they heard could
have made metonym production more accessible. Although three-year-olds
rarely produced metonymic nicknames spontaneously, our findings suggest
that they could already extract some metonymic patterns. The older
children, however, may have used a more reﬂective strategy in which they
focused on coming up with names that would ﬁt the individuals in the
pictures. This could have outweighed any eﬀect of prior exposure to
examples of metonymic names.
We also found age differences for other answer types in this task, not just for
metonyms.Unlike inTask , the youngest childrenwere more likely to produce
descriptions than other ages. Using descriptions may have been easier in this
task than in referring to the games in Task , since children did not have to
remember any earlier instructions. In addition, metonymic naming could be
more demanding in the metalinguistic skill required. This could explain the
relatively low number of metonyms produced by three-year-olds in
the no-example condition. Ease of production could then explain reliance on
other answer types, in particular descriptions and proper names, from
three-year-olds compared with five-year-olds and adults.
Finally, the finding that pictures of people and familiar animal types
elicited more metonyms than compounds or descriptions suggests that
referential metonymy of this kind serves mainly to create additional names
for individual types already known to children.
<Conclusion>
GENERAL DISCUSSION.
The goal of this study was to investigate preschoolers’ skill in interpreting
and producing novel metonyms. Our focus was on whether young children
could cope pragmatically with metonymic meanings, and, if so, whether
we could identify a stage at which this skill emerged, and whether this
corresponded to the emergence of other kinds of figurative language. We
considered two issues: first, whether children could understand novel
metonyms in contexts where the metonymic association was available
perceptually and linguistically; and second, whether the same children
could produce referential metonyms, both with a shorthand and a naming
function. However, since metonymic names appear to be more complex
than metonymic shorthands, we proposed that the ability to produce
metonymic names might be a later acquisition.
We found some support for both proposals. First, the results of Task 
suggested that, by age three, children are pragmatically skilled enough to
understand some novel metonyms in context, although they have some
way to go before they reach an adult level of understanding. Children also
became better able to explain metonymic meanings between age three and
age five. Surprisingly, performance on the comprehension task appeared to
decrease with age, with older children more likely to choose literal than
figurative interpretations of novel metonyms.
Second, the results of Task  suggested that preschoolers can use
metonymy as a shorthand referential strategy. This form of metonymy was
equally prevalent in three-, four-, and ﬁve-year-olds. The results also
showed that three-year-olds produced fewer descriptions than the older
children in the play-context, suggesting that they found it easier to use a
metonym than a more ‘literal’ description, where the latter might be more
complex syntactically and conceptually. Finally, the results of Task 
suggested that the ability to produce metonymic names for individuals
based on salient properties also emerges in the preschool years, but
slightly later than metonymic shorthands.
The metonymic skill of preschoolers.
Based on these results, what picture can we draw of preschoolers’ metonymic
skill? Our ﬁndings suggest that three-year-olds are already pragmatically
skilled enough to understand some novel metonymic expressions in
context. They are also able to produce referential metonyms with a
shorthand function based on part–whole relations linking objects with
salient properties. Then, between ages four and ﬁve, we also see a growing
ability to produce metonymic (nick-)names for familiar animate beings,
and to explain metonymic meanings. The increasing tendency in older
children to interpret some metonyms literally reﬂects – we suggest – this
growing metalinguistic ability, which may lead them to overemphasize
literal meanings. Their newly acquired ability to distinguish between
linguistic meaning and speaker meaning may create conﬂicts that they do
not yet know how to resolve. A typical example comes from a boy (;)
who chose the metonymic reading ﬁrst, then ‘corrected’ himself: “No
actually, it’s this one. Cause you said ‘The big beard gets in the canoe ﬁrst’.”
But do three-year-olds show true understanding of metonyms in the
comprehension task? Notice that most of them did not seem able to reﬂect
on their meanings, that is, reﬂect on what the speaker could have ‘meant’,
although such meta-reﬂection is not required for proper understanding.
Indeed, three-year-olds could be ‘naive’ interpreters in this task in the
sense they follow a path of least eﬀort in constructing an
interpretation of the speaker’s utterance, which could have involved seizing
on anything (e.g. the helmet, the moustache, etc.) that allowed them to
identify the referent. As Sperber () pointed out, a naive interpretation
strategy could yield adequate comprehension whenever the speaker is
benevolent and skilled enough to realize what is relevant and salient for
the addressee at that instant. In the comprehension task, we tried to
achieve this by giving practice trials for metonymic interpretations ﬁrst,
and making sure that the metonymic association was perceptually
available, even salient, in context. However, older children may have been
following a more ‘cautious’ interpretation strategy, one that takes into
account the possibility that the speaker could have misjudged what would
be most accessible and relevant on that occasion. Older children’s frequent
hesitations between metonymic and literal interpretations give support to
the possibility that they were relying on a more advanced comprehension
strategy than the younger ones, albeit one that led them astray.

One question that remains is at what point in development children begin
to improve their performance, before they reach adult-like levels of
comprehension. In Van Herwegen et al.,’s () study of novel metonym
and metaphor comprehension in children aged three to seventeen, most
six-year-olds managed some metonyms and metaphors, which suggests
that children have begun to improve already at this age. However, we need
to look at a wider age range to establish the full developmental trajectory
for novel metonym comprehension.

One unexpected ﬁnding in Task  was that exposing children to examples of a
speciﬁc metonymic pattern only had an eﬀect on the productions of the
three-year-olds and the adults. Without examples, we elicited metonymic
names mainly from the four- and ﬁve-year-olds. Why did the age groups diﬀer
in this way? Could it be that, with examples, the three-year-olds produced
metonyms as a least eﬀort option, much as we have suggested they did in
comprehension, rather than actively and reﬂectively constructing metonymic
names on the basis of salient properties for the individuals being referred to?
Even if this were the case, it remains to be explained why three-year-olds were
sensitive to, and able to extract the metonymic pattern PROPERTY FOR
INDIVIDUAL from the examples provided, while the four-and ﬁve-year-olds
apparently did not.
Referential strategies.
The two production tasks provide some insight into the strategies young
children can use in referring to things that lack a ready-made category label
(Task ) or proper name (Task ). The morphologically simplest strategy is to
use simple noun phrases in the form of metonymic shorthands (the straws, the
moustache). The use of novel compound nouns (the straw game, the moustache
man) reflects another option, one that is slightly more complex
morphologically. The third, most complex type, with modified noun phrases
for the target referents (the game with the straws, the man with the big
moustache), offers yet another means of referring where there is no ready-made
term. Each referential strategy the children employed reflects a path into the
kinds of uses adults make of these devices. One common context for the first
two strategies is news headlines, e.g. “Syria and Iraq can’t be solved by
western boots on the ground” (The Guardian, ..), “Ruling in death
of Ferrari woman” (referring to a woman who wanted to be buried in her
Ferrari; cf. Clark & Clark, , p. ), etc., both exploiting salient
associations in making shorthand reference.
In Task , three-year-olds’ frequent use of simple noun phrases in the
form of metonymic shorthands, and relatively rare use of modified noun
phrases, suggests that morphological complexity may play some role in
choices of referential expression. It also suggests that the production of a
metonym – at least in this task – may actually be conceptually easier than
production of a more elaborate, ‘literal’ description. Further support for
this comes from possible precursors to metonymy: overextensions, early
symbolic gestures, onomatopoeias, even denominal verbs, produced by
very young children to compensate for gaps in their current vocabulary.
In Task , however, the youngest children’s preference for modified
noun phrases over simple ones in the naming of animate beings, suggests
that the demands of metonymic naming can sometimes outweigh
morphological complexity.
Taken together, the findings from Tasks  and  show for the first time
that for children, metonymy may serve a function similar to compounding,
as a productive option for referring to entities that lack a conventional
label or proper name. Interestingly, the findings from Task  also suggest
that the referential functions of metonymy and compounding may to some
extent be complementary, with metonyms used to name familiar
individual types and compounds unfamiliar ones.
Metonymy vs. metaphor
Our findings suggest that children’s ability to deal with metonymy starts to
emerge early on, with some ability to understand, produce, and explain
metonyms already established by age three. This is a year or two earlier
than has been suggested for metaphor (cf. Özçalışkan, ; Stites &
Özçalışkan, ), and adds support to the view that metonymy may be
conceptually simpler than metaphor (Rundblad & Annaz, ; but cf.
Van Herwegen et al., ). It also suggests that metonymy and metaphor
may be rather different processes, as some pragmatic theories have
proposed (e.g. Papafragou, ; Wilson & Carston, ). However, the
literal preference in comprehension among older children patterns with
similar findings from studies of metaphor (e.g. Asch & Nerlove, ;
Billow, ; Winner, /; Winner et al., ), and suggests that
both abilities interact with and depend on the development of more
general metalinguistic and pragmatic skills. A crucial point is what
underlies the notion of a ‘literal preference’. Some researchers have taken
it to involve a primitive form of comprehension, prevalent until school
age, in which linguistic input is processed piece-by-piece without taking
context into account (Levorato & Cacciari, ). But the fact that
production does not seem to be affected, and that five-year-olds, for all
their literal-mindedness, show signs of employing a more sophisticated
comprehension strategy where they reflect explicitly on what the speaker
might have meant by the choice of linguistic expression, leads us to treat
these findings as more compatible with a view that takes the literal
preference to involve no more than a tendency to choose literal over
figurative interpretations at a certain stage in development, due to some
form of competition between the two. The parallel development of the
child’s metalinguistic and pragmatic skills may simply give a false
impression of primitive understanding.
Finally, these findings suggest that a key next step is to explore how the
acquisition of figurative devices such as metonymy interacts with the
development of other communication-relevant abilities – one being
metalinguistic awareness – which plausibly influence children’s figurative
language competence.
