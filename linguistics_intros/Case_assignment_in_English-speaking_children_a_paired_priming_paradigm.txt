This study employed a paired priming paradigm to ask whether input
features inﬂuence a child’s propensity to use non-nominative versus
nominative case in subject position, and to use non-nominative forms
even when verbs are marked for agreement. Thirty English-speaking
children (ages ; to ;) heard sentences with pronouns that had
non-contrasting case forms (e.g. Dad hugs it and it hugs Tigger) and it
was hypothesized that these forms would lead to more errors (e.g.
Him hugs Barney) in an elicited phrase more often than if the
children heard contrasting case forms (e.g. Dad hugs us and we hug
the doggie). Tense/agreement features were also examined in children’s
elicited productions. The ﬁndings were consistent with predictions,
and supported the input ambiguity hypothesis of Pelham ().
Implications for current accounts of the optional inﬁnitive stage are
discussed.

English-speaking children tend to produce grammatical errors as part of
normal development. These errors can include omission of tense and
agreement (tense/agreement) markers, such as Mom hug me instead of
Mom hugs me. Pronoun errors are also observed, and in English are

evidenced as case errors, as in Her hug Elmo instead of She hugs Elmo.
Children may also produce errors such as Her hugs Elmo but generative
grammar accounts of grammatical development have suggested that these
errors should occur rarely or never (Wexler, Schütze & Rice, ). Other
accounts of language development have suggested that productions like
Her hugs Elmo may actually occur more often than previously expected,
and that inﬂuences of language input may help to explain why these error
patterns occur (Ambridge & Pine, ; Coker, Pine & Gobet, ;
Pelham, ; Pine, Joseph & Conti-Ramsden, ; Pine, Rowland,
Lieven & Theakston, ). This study was designed to examine whether
pronoun case and tense/agreement features can be inﬂuenced by factors in
the input.

Optional use of tense/agreement and pronoun errors
Analysis of longitudinal language samples from young English-speaking
children has revealed that most typically developing children often omit
tense/agreement morphemes from obligatory contexts for some period of
time after they begin combining words into phrases (e.g. Rice, Wexler &
Hershberger, ; Rispoli, Hadley & Holt, ). Wexler and his
colleagues have described this as the optional inﬁnitive (OI) period (Rice,
Wexler & Cleave, ; Rice et al., ; Wexler, ). According to
these investigators, young children have knowledge of syntax but fail to
understand that verbs must be ﬁnite in main clauses. As a result, they
alternate between using tense/agreement forms appropriately and using a
non-ﬁnite form in their place. Aﬀected forms include present third person
singular -s (e.g. Mommy hugs me / Mommy hug me), copula be forms (e.g.
Mommy is nice / Mommy nice), auxiliary be forms (e.g. Mommy is hugging
me / Mommy hugging me), and past -ed (e.g. Mommy hugged me / Mommy
hug me) (Wexler, ). Typically developing children may remain in the
OI stage until four or ﬁve years of age before using tense/agreement
markers in more than % of obligatory contexts (Rice & Wexler, a,
b, c; Rice et al., ).

Wexler and his colleagues later reﬁned their explanation for how the OI
phase ﬁts within the generative grammar framework by proposing the
Agreement/Tense Omission Model (ATOM; Schütze & Wexler, ;
Wexler et al., ). According to the ATOM, when children in the OI
period overtly mark agreement features on a verb (e.g. walks) they should
also use a correct nominative case pronoun (e.g. He walks). But if children
produce a verb without overt agreement (e.g. walk) in a context that requires
it, they may produce either a nominative (e.g. he) or non-nominative (e.g.
him) subject pronoun. Note that agreement markers in English also mark
tense; therefore, unless both agreement and tense appear in the underlying

syntax, the morpheme cannot be expressed. If agreement is represented
without tense, nominative case is licensed even though the absence of tense
prevents expression of the fused tense/agreement inﬂection (resulting in He
walk). Conversely, if tense is represented without agreement, nominative case
is not licensed and the default form for English (accusative or objective case)
is used (e.g. Him walk). This distinction between agreement and tense
provides an explanation for why some children are observed to produce
utterances such as Him talked. Such utterances presumably lack agreement
(accounting for the use of him rather than he) but, because -ed marks tense
only, its expression is not blocked by the lack of agreement.

Although the ATOM can account for a range of attested child language
productions, this model provides no basis for expecting an utterance such
as Him walks because the presence of the inﬂection -s implies the presence
of agreement, which should license nominative case. If such errors occur,
they should be infrequent and the result of a language production
performance error, according to this account. The same expectations arise
for other tense/agreement morphemes. Thus, She walking and Her walking
can be expected (along with the correct She is walking), but Her is walking
is not predicted to occur.

Wexler et al. () tested the predictions of the ATOM in children with
typical development as well as those with speciﬁc language impairment. As
predicted, they found that the highest frequency of non-nominative subjects
occurred with non-ﬁnite forms. After eliminating children who showed
evidence of only one pronoun case (e.g. a child who said him but never said
he or vice versa), they evaluated the resulting group of children (with ‘case
contrast’) and again found the highest frequency of non-nominative subjects
in non-ﬁnite clauses and the least frequent with agreeing verbs. The authors
concluded that the predictions of the ATOM model held true even though
there were some instances when children produced non-nominative subjects
(e.g. Him hugs). Wexler and
with verbs marked for tense/agreement
colleagues attributed all instances of these unexpected errors to performance
errors by the child, small sample size, and potential sampling error.

However, several subsequent studies of spontaneous and elicited speech
production by typically developing children and children with speciﬁc
language impairment have reported use of non-nominative subjects with
verbs marked for tense/agreement at rates higher than would be expected
based on the ATOM’s predictions (Ambridge & Pine, ; Charest &
Leonard, ; Loeb & Leonard, ; Pine et al., ; Pine et al., ;
Wisman Weil & Leonard, ). These studies reveal that the general
patterns of agreement and case assignment predicted by the ATOM hold,
but errors of the type Him hugs occur too often to be dismissed as noise in
the data.

W I S M A N W E I L A N D L E O N A R D

The role of input
Input-based accounts of language acquisition may be helpful in explaining
why errors such as Him hugs occur more often than previously assumed by
generativist accounts. In an attempt to explain young English-speaking
children’s me-for-I errors, Kirjavainen, Theakston, and Lieven ()
examined the relationship between children’s productions of me in subject
position and their caregivers’ use of me in secondary clauses (e.g. Let me
do it), using longitudinal data from children ages two to four years in the
Manchester corpus. Proportional productions of me in preverbal contexts
between children and their caregivers were signiﬁcantly correlated and
there was a match between the speciﬁc verbs used in these contexts by
children and their caregivers. In other words, if a child said Me do it, it
was likely that the mother had said phrases such as Let me do it, Help me
do it, or Watch me do it more often than other verbs in the input that were
not used in me + Verb complement clauses. Thus English-speaking
children are thought to extract their me-for-I productions from these me +
Verb complement clauses heard in the input (Lieven, ).

The frequency of case-distinct (e.g. we–us) versus case-ambiguous (e.g. you–
you) pronouns in the input to children by their caregivers may also point to an
explanation for why English-acquiring children produce pronoun case errors.
According to the input ambiguity hypothesis of Pelham (), a relationship
exists between the rate of case ambiguity produced by adult speakers of a
language and the case errors produced by children acquiring that language.
Pelham compared corpora of English and German because English-
acquiring children produce pronoun case errors, whereas German-acquiring
children rarely produce pronoun case errors but do produce article case
errors. In support of the input ambiguity hypothesis, Pelham reported that
English-speaking caregivers produced ambiguous pronouns (it, you, her)
·% of
the time. In contrast, German adults produced ambiguous
pronouns only ·% of the time, when speaking with their young children.

Given the high frequency of case-ambiguous pronouns produced by
English-speaking caregivers in their speech to young children, it may be
possible that children temporarily form abstract rules about the properties of
pronouns from highly frequent examples of you and it in both nominative
and object case positions. Experimental and longitudinal studies are needed
to examine whether there might be a correspondence between the syntactic
frames used by English-speaking caregivers with you and it forms and the
frames children use when producing non-nominative for nominative
pronoun case errors. It may be that speciﬁc pre- or post-verbal contexts in
which case-ambiguous pronouns are used by English-speaking caregivers as
in () and () contribute to children’s overextensions of non-nominative
pronouns to subject positions as in () and ().

The present study examines the input-based factors that may contribute to
why children make pronoun errors, with special reference to the input
ambiguity hypothesis. We pursue this issue through a modiﬁed structural
priming task. Structural priming refers to the inﬂuence that the grammatical
form of one sentence (e.g. The girl bought the present for her mother) can
have on the form of a subsequent sentence (e.g. an utterance produced as
The boy gave the money to his sister rather than The boy gave his sister the
money). This inﬂuence can occur at a rather abstract structural level, as it is
seen even when the subsequent utterance shares no lexical content or
thematic relations with the prior utterance (Bock & Loebell, ). In the
classic structural priming paradigm (Bock, ), participants hear and
repeat sentences (the prime) and then describe target pictures that are
semantically unrelated to the prime, but amenable to the same sentence
structure. Variations of this method have included speakers listening but not
repeating the prime, and describing the target picture after several ﬁller
pictures have appeared between the prime and the target picture (see
reviews in Leonard, ; Pickering & Ferreira, ).

Although the early structural priming studies used adults as participants,
a growing number of studies have examined priming in children (e.g.
Bencini & Valian, ; Foltz, Thiele, Kahsnitz & Stenneken, ;
Garraﬀa, Coco & Branigan, ; Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva & Shimpi,
; Miller & Deevy, ; Rowland, Chang, Ambridge, Pine & Lieven,
; Savage, Lieven, Theakston & Tomasello, ; Shimpi, Gámez,
Huttenlocher & Vasilyeva, ; Thothathiri & Snedeker, ). Most
studies of children have primed syntactic structure (e.g.
inﬂuencing
children’s use of passive sentences through the experimenter’s use of
passives). However, Leonard and colleagues have found priming eﬀects on
the use of grammatical morphemes such as auxiliary is and past tense -ed
by children at a stage of development when these morphemes were only
inconsistently used in obligatory contexts (Leonard, Miller, Deevy, Rauf,

Gerber & Charest, ; Leonard, Miller, Grela, Holland, Gerber &
Petucci, ).

In adults, target sentences that include some of the same lexical items as
the prime sentence show even stronger priming eﬀects than prime–target
pairs that share only syntactic structure. However, this ‘lexical boost’ is
short-lived; when several ﬁller sentences appear between the prime and the
target, the priming eﬀects are the same as for prime–target pairs that have
no lexical overlap. Importantly, in young children, the lexical boost is not
seen. One possible reason is that the boost is the result of explicit memory
of details of the prime sentence, and young children’s memory skills may
not be suﬃcient to retain such information (Rowland et al., ).

One prominent view of structural priming is that it represents a type of
implicit learning that aﬀects, incrementally, a speaker’s command of syntactic
structure (Bock & Griﬃn, ). Learning is assumed when speakers
continue to show the inﬂuence of a prime even with intervening material and
time before the production of the target. In addition, computational models
based on structural priming show clear
is
independent of speciﬁc lexical content (Chang, Dell & Bock, ). The
implicit nature of such learning is illustrated by the ﬁnding that adults with
anterograde
showed structural priming even with multiple
intervening ﬁllers even though these individuals had only limited recognition
memory of the prime sentences that had been presented just minutes before
(Ferreira, Bock, Wilson & Cohen, ).

From the implicit learning perspective, there are more than parallels
between changes due to priming and changes that occur in children’s
syntactic development. As noted by Rowland et al. (, p. ), structural
priming may be “a consequence of
learning
mechanism that is responsible for learning syntactic representations in the
ﬁrst place”.

To evaluate the input ambiguity hypothesis, we created a modiﬁcation of
the structural priming paradigm, referred to here as ‘paired priming’. In this
modiﬁcation, children hear and repeat not a single prime sentence before
responding, but a pair of prime sentences in which the referent that serves
as the direct object in the ﬁrst sentence of the pair serves as the subject of
the sentence in the second sentence of the pair. In this way, we could
provide grammatical sentence pairs in which the pronoun takes the same
form in object and subject position, as in Mom feeds you . . . and you feed
Pluto, as well as sentence pairs whose object and subject forms diﬀer, as in
Mom hugs me . . . and I hug Tinker Bell. Once the second sentence of the
pair is repeated by the child, the examiner then provides the ﬁrst sentence
of a second pair, asking the child to provide the next sentence of this pair,
as in Mom feeds her and [child describes a picture of the same girl who, in
turn, is feeding another character] or Mom hugs him and [child describes a

picture of the same boy who, in turn, is hugging another character]. We
hypothesized that after hearing sentence pairs involving non-contrasting
pronouns such as you–you, the children would be more likely to complete
the second pair with a subject pronoun that matches the object form used
in the preceding sentence, as in Her feed/feeds Mickey Mouse. The
children’s responses were also expected to contain a relatively large
number of third person singular -s productions even when produced with
a non-nominative subject pronoun (as in Her feeds) because this inﬂection
will have appeared in the examiner’s production and should also serve as a
prime.

Participants
Thirty monolingual English-speaking children ( female,  male) with
typical
language development participated. The children ranged in age
from ; to ; (M = ;, SD = · months). All were enrolled in a
preschool or daycare and parents reported no concerns about speech and
language development. Each child also demonstrated normal
language
abilities based on a standard score above – standard deviation of the mean
(M = ·, SD = ·) on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, th
Edition (PPVT-; Dunn & Dunn, ). All children also passed a pure
tone audiometric screening at  dB HL for , , , and  Hz
bilaterally. Six additional children were initially enrolled in the study but
did not qualify. These children ( female,  male) were aged ; to ;
(M = ;, SD = · months). All six of the children were excluded because
they were unwilling or unable to participate in the research activities
during the ﬁrst one or two research sessions.

Procedures
Participants completed assessment and research tasks in three or four –
-minute sessions in the authors’ child language lab (n = ), in a quiet
room at the child’s school (n = ), in the child’s home (n = ), or at the
child’s school and home (n = ). A summary of the schedule of tasks
appears in Table . All sessions were digitally audio-recorded using a
Marantz professional
solid-state recorder, model PMD, with an
external microphone (Crown® PZM® - Pressure Zone Microphone®).
A parent of each participant consented to the research activities in
accordance with standards of the authors’ Institutional Review Board.

Research sessions were typically conducted once a week,

for three
consecutive weeks. One session involved language testing and the second
and third sessions involved the two paired priming conditions along with
completion of the language testing. A fourth session was used to complete

language testing, when needed (n = ). For all participants, there was at least
one week between participation in each of two paired priming conditions.

The children’s pre-experiment pronoun and third person singular -s use. Prior
to administering the paired priming task, it was critical to determine whether
children were, in fact, using pronouns of diﬀerent forms as well as the third
person singular -s
inﬂection. Our hypotheses were grounded on the
assumption that both nominative and non-nominative pronouns were
present in the children’s inventories, and that they had begun to use third
person singular -s in at least limited contexts. It was important, therefore,
to document this type of use. Although spontaneous speech samples
would be the most natural means of obtaining this information, these
samples may not necessarily include the obligatory contexts for the forms
of interest. For this reason, we chose to use more structured tasks that
included obligatory contexts for diﬀerent pronoun forms and third person
singular -s. Spontaneous speech samples were also obtained; however,
these served primarily to provide supplementary information about the
children’s use of the forms of interest.

In Table , we present the children’s pre-experiment use of pronouns and
third person singular -s. As described below, from the larger group of thirty
children, twenty-one children provided evidence of using all relevant
pronouns (he, she, him, her) and a suﬃcient number of scorable responses
in the paired priming task to permit data analysis. Table  provides the
pre-experiment use for all thirty children, and for the twenty-one children
providing the ﬁnal data analysis set.

Pre-experiment pronoun use. For the structured pronoun task, nominative,
objective, and genitive case third person pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/her,
they/them/their) were elicited from the children. An interactive iPad
application was created using Keynote version · for Mac (Apple Inc.,
–) and Keynote version ·· for iPad (Apple Inc., –).
Participants viewed the presentation via Keynote for iPad on the iPad 
(Model MCLL) running iOS ·· (Apple Inc., –).

Participants sat next to the examiner, and a dog puppet acted as a
confederate to encourage the child to talk about the stimuli. The stimuli
were set up to elicit sentences about WHO PLAYS WITH WHAT. Pictures
included real photographs of a boy and a girl playing with a variety of
toys. The toys were selected to be relatable and familiar to the children
who participated in this study. The child heard a series of six questions of
the type Who is playing with X?, aimed at eliciting nominative case
pronouns. The child ﬁrst chose one of three pictures (target picture or two
foils). Upon touching the correct picture the child heard “nice work” (or
similar reinforcement), followed by the request, Okay, now tell Doggie, who
is playing with X? The target response expected was He/She/They is/are
playing with X. If the child did not respond, or responded with a single
word (e.g. Him), the child was shown a prompt screen, heard the prompt
question again (Who is playing with X?) and the examiner used the foil
pictures to model an appropriate response (e.g. Look, she is playing with a
hat, they are playing with the house, and . . .). The examiner encouraged the
child to imitate her description of the foil pictures to encourage use of a

complete phrase in response to the target picture. If the child still did not
respond, the next item was administered.

The six objective case and six genitive case items were administered in a
similar fashion. The prompt question for elicitation of objective pronouns
was: Who does the X belong to?, with the target response being: The X
belongs to him/her/them. For genitive items, the prompt question was:
Whose X is this?, and the target response was: This is his/her/their X. For
genitive responses, the child was required to produce the entire noun
phrase to ensure use of a possessive determiner (his, her, their) rather than
a possessive independent function pronoun (his/hers/theirs). Thus, children
who produced one-word responses
following the genitive
elicitation question were shown the prompt screen, heard the elicitation
question again (e.g. Whose hat is this?) and the examiner used the foil
pictures to model an appropriate response (e.g. Look, this is his turtle, this
is their bus, and this is . . .). If the child still did not provide an on-target
response, then the next item was administered.

(e.g. his)

The three diﬀerent pronoun case types were consistently presented in the
same order for all participants: nominative, objective, and genitive. When
needed, the child was given breaks between blocks or completed other
portions of the assessment battery between each section of the pronoun
production screener.

The elicited pronoun production measure was scored on-line by the
examiner, scoring was checked and necessary changes were made after
listening to the audio-recording. An elicited pronoun error rate was
calculated based on data from the elicitation task. The pronoun error rate
was the total number of pronoun case errors divided by the total number
of attempts (errors plus correct productions).

Pre-experiment third person singular -s use. To gain an impression of the
children’s use of third person singular -s prior to the administration of the
paired priming task, we administered the Test of Early Grammatical
Impairment (TEGI; Rice & Wexler, ), a test of ﬁniteness marking
abilities in young English-speaking children. Children were ﬁrst administered
the phonological portion of
suﬃciently accurate
productions of word-ﬁnal /s/ and /z/ phonemes in monomorphemic contexts
(a minimum of % correct
for each phoneme). After passing the
phonological portion of the TEGI, participants completed the third person
singular -s portion. Scores were reported as percentage correct with possible
scores ranging from  to . Percentage correct scores were employed rather
than criterion scores because the TEGI was normed on children above the
age of ; and some of our participants were younger than ;.

sample was to collect a minimum of ten subject pronoun productions in
order to accurately assess spontaneous pronoun use (Rispoli, ). In
order to collect as many diﬀerent third person pronoun productions as
possible, children also spent – minutes talking about the pictures in a
large picture board book entitled, Find and Say, illustrated by Gill Guile
(). Pictures in the book depict people and families in a variety of
everyday activities including at the farm, by the river, in town, at the
beach, around the house, and celebrating a holiday.

The child utterances from the language samples were transcribed and
coded by the ﬁrst author for morphology and syntax using standard
Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts conventions (SALT; Miller,
Long, McKinley, Thormann, Jones & Nockerts, ). All correct
pronoun productions and pronoun errors were coded. A spontaneous
pronoun error rate was computed from the language samples given the
total number of pronoun case errors divided by the total number of
attempts (errors plus correct productions). The use or omission of third

Paired priming task. A paired priming task was designed and administered
utilizing a within-subject design. The goal was to determine whether features
of pronoun case in the input can be manipulated to prime young
English-speaking children to produce more subject pronoun errors. This
study provides the ﬁrst experimental test of the input ambiguity hypothesis
(Pelham, ) utilizing a new experimental design, a paired priming task.
The priming task had two conditions – one containing primes with
case-contrasting pronouns (I/me, we/us),
the other with non-contrasting
(case-ambiguous) pronouns (you/you, it/it). The design was within-subjects,
blocked by condition type,
and
separated by at least one week between condition types.

In each condition, participants ﬁrst heard a story with a high frequency of
non-contrasting pronouns (modiﬁed version of Just for You, originally by
Mercer Mayer) or a story with a high frequency of contrasting pronouns
(modiﬁed version of I Went Walking, originally by Sue Williams). The
purpose of each story was to provide a more typical context in which the
relevant pronouns occurred, so that the transition to the subsequent paired
priming task was not abrupt. The use of the pronouns in the stories
served as additional
input and thus might have had an eﬀect on the
absolute level of priming that occurred in the paired priming task.
However, our focus was on the relative level of priming in the two
conditions, and the stories that preceded the priming task were equated in

Ten items were used in each condition, with the same ten transitive verbs
used in both conditions. The ten transitive verbs (chase, cover, drive, feed,
hug, kiss, pull, push, touch, wash) were selected based on their likelihood to
be familiar to young children and their ease of demonstration in a scenario
enacted with toys. All ten of the verbs chosen were produced by at least
% of typically developing children by age ; in the normative sample
on the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (Fenson
et al., ). The groups of four characters per item (e.g. Tinker Bell,
doggie, Barney, and kitty) were presented as a group and in the same
order in both conditions but were paired with diﬀerent verbs each time.
This allowed any possible inﬂuence of the characters (e.g. familiarity or
interest by the child) to remain constant across conditions and allowed the
activity to seem more novel and interesting to the child since the same
characters were engaged in diﬀerent activities across the two conditions.
All items in each condition required use of both he and she, with the order

The ﬁrst author initially collected on-line responses for the paired priming
task and transcribed responses to both conditions for each of the thirty
participants. To assess reliability, two trained research assistants listened to
each audio-recording and checked each transcript. These individuals were
told to pay particular attention to the child’s use of pronouns and
inclusion or exclusion of
forms. They were
unaware of
the study. Inter-rater
agreement on the paired priming task for pronoun scoring was perfect in
the non-contrasting (ambiguous) pronoun condition (kappa = ·) and
very good in the contrasting pronoun condition (kappa = ·). Inter-rater
agreement on the paired priming task for third person singular -s scoring
was very good in both the non-contrasting pronoun condition (kappa =
·), and the contrasting pronoun condition (kappa = ·). In cases of
disagreement, the ﬁrst author listened again to the audio-recordings and
made changes only if the research assistant’s judgment appeared to be

All thirty children participated in the paired priming task. However, to
promote a more accurate test of the role of input, we applied additional
restrictions to the data. First, we ensured that all children included in the
analysis set showed use of all four third person singular nominative and
objective pronoun forms – he, him,
and her – on our pronoun
production task and/or in their spontaneous speech sample. Requiring all
four pronoun forms ensured that data would not be distorted by the
absence of certain forms from the children’s inventories (see Schütze,
). Second, we included only those children who provided at least ﬁve
scorable responses for each dependent measure (pronouns in subject
position, obligatory contexts
for each

nominal subject (e.g. the little girl) rather than a pronominal subject. The

can be seen from Table , the twenty-one children forming the analysis set
were very similar to the larger group of children; in fact, all analyses
reported for the twenty-one children were also conducted for the larger
pool of thirty children with identical results. We focus here on the
twenty-one children who met the more stringent criteria.

The two paired priming conditions did not diﬀer in the number of scorable
responses provided by the ﬁnal analysis set of twenty-one children. A
response was considered scorable if it included a third person singular
pronominal masculine or feminine subject. For scorable pronoun responses
in the non-contrasting condition, the mean was · (SD = ·); for
scorable pronoun responses in the contrasting condition, the mean was
· (SD = ·); (t() = ·, p = ·). For obligatory contexts for third
person singular -s in the non-contrasting and contrasting conditions, the
means were · (SD = ·) and · (SD = ·), respectively (t() =
·, p = ·). Preliminary analyses also revealed that the order in which the
two conditions were presented did not aﬀect the children’s tendency to
produce non-nominative pronouns. Non-nominative subject pronoun use

non-contrasting pronouns condition ﬁrst (M = ·, SD = ·) or given the
contrasting pronouns condition ﬁrst (M = ·, SD = ·), t() = ·, p
= ·). Non-nominative subject pronoun use was also similar in the
contrasting pronouns condition regardless of whether the non-contrasting
pronouns condition (M = ·, SD = ·) or the contrasting pronouns
condition (M = ·, SD = ·) was administered ﬁrst
(t() = ·, p
= ·). Males and females also did not diﬀer in their performance. In the
non-contrasting pronouns condition, males (M = ·, SD = ·) and
females (M = ·, SD = ·) did not diﬀer in their use of non-nominative
case subject pronouns (t() = ·, p = ·). Similarly, in the contrasting
pronouns condition, males (M = ·, SD = ·) and females (M = ·,
SD = ·) did not diﬀer in their use of non-nominative case subject
pronouns (t() = ·, p = ·). Given no eﬀects of condition order or sex,
these two factors were collapsed in all subsequent analyses.

A paired samples t-test was used to compare the use of non-nominative case
pronouns in the contrasting pronouns and non-contrasting (ambiguous)
pronouns conditions. One-tailed t-tests were used given the hypothesis that
the non-contrasting (ambiguous) pronouns condition would be more likely
to elicit non-nominative case pronoun productions as compared to the
contrasting pronouns condition. Indeed,
the non-contrasting pronouns
condition was found to elicit production of more non-nominative case
pronouns (M = ·, SD = ·) compared with the contrasting pronouns
condition (M = ·, SD = ·); (t() = ·, p < ·). As can be seen
from Figure , only one child showed a pattern opposite to the dominant
pattern, and two others showed comparable scores for the two conditions.

In general, the diﬀerences between the two conditions were dramatic. These
results suggest that priming with pronouns that had case ambiguity (you–you,
it–it) was more likely to elicit a subsequent non-nominative case subject
pronoun (him in place of he, her in place of she) than priming with
case-contrasting pronouns (I–me, we–us).

Third person singular -s use with nominative and non-nominative pronouns
Another question of interest in the study was whether input-induced
non-nominative pronoun use would be accompanied by third person
singular inﬂections (e.g. Her covers the kitty). To pursue this question, a
binomial probability test was used to determine whether third person
singular -s productions with non-nominative subjects were occurring more
than % of the time. Pine et al. () reasoned that since the ATOM
predicts that non-nominative subjects with agreeing verb forms should
occur rarely or never, setting the chance level at % would represent a
reasonable amount of ‘noise’ in the data to test this claim. A binomial
probability
at <http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/
binomialX.html>) was utilized with n = total number of +NOM and –
NOM subjects with +AGR verb forms, k = observed or expected number
of –NOM subjects with +AGR verb forms, and p = ·. One-tailed p
values were utilized based on the exact binomial calculation of
the
likelihood that k or more instances would occur out of n opportunities
signiﬁcantly more than % of the time. The frequency of the children’s
use of nominative and non-nominative subject pronouns with and without
third person singular -s appears in Table . Binomial testing indicated that
third person singular -s with non-nominative
the children’s use of
pronoun subjects (e.g. Him hugs Barney or Her hugs Barney) was much
greater than % (p < ·). This was true not only for items in the
non-contrasting pronoun condition but
for items in the contrasting
pronoun condition as well.

(available

The high degree of third person singular -s use could well have been
inﬂuenced by priming eﬀects. Note that for each non-contrasting pronoun
item, the child heard ﬁve instances of third person singular -s produced by
the experimenter. This can be seen in examples () and (). For each
contrasting pronoun item, the child heard four instances of this inﬂection,
as can be seen in examples () and (). One observation consistent with
this priming interpretation is
the ﬁnding that participants were
signiﬁcantly more likely to use third person -s in both the contrasting
pronouns
and the non-contrasting
pronouns condition (M = ·, SD = ·) than on the TEGI third person
singular task (M = ·, SD = ·), (t() = ·, p = ·) and (t() = ·,
p = ·), respectively.

D I S C U S S I O N
Pelham () provided naturalistic evidence that demonstrated a strong
correlation
of
non-contrasting pronouns and English-acquiring children’s tendency to
produce pronoun case errors. This study extended the ﬁndings of Pelham
and demonstrated that, in a paired priming task, children are more likely to
produce non-nominative case pronouns when presented with non-contrasting
(case-ambiguous) pronouns (i.e. you–you and it–it) than with contrasting
pronouns (i.e. I–me and we–us). Of the children with an adequate number of
scorable responses (more than ﬁve) in both conditions of the paired priming
task, eighteen of twenty-one showed greater production of non-nominative
case pronouns when primed with non-contrasting pronouns.

It is important to point out that the prompt immediately before the child’s
response (e.g. Mom hugs him and . . .) was of the same form in the two
priming conditions. Therefore, the factor that seems most responsible for
the diﬀerence between the conditions is the type of pronoun used prior to
the prompt. These pronouns were uniformly grammatical; they diﬀered
only in whether they showed a case contrast (as in I–me) or were instead
identical across subject and object contexts (as in you–you).

instantaneous;

We interpret the results in the following way. Children’s early use of
non-nominative pronouns in subject position may have been inﬂuenced by
the case ambiguity of certain pronouns in the input, as proposed by
Pelham (). The children in the present study were at a point in
development when pronouns with nominative case were being acquired
and were replacing non-nominative forms. However,
this substitution
process is not
it occurs incrementally with additional
experience with the input. In the meantime, there is competition between
newly acquired (correct) forms, and the forms that had been used in the
same context. The data presented support a growing body of literature (see
Bock & Griﬃn, ) suggesting that structural priming is a type of
implicit learning that involves the same learning mechanism that occurs in
grammatical development. This learning is assumed to involve structure at
a more abstract level, with each encounter with an exemplar having a
small eﬀect on the strength of the structure’s representation. At the age of
the children in the present study, any overlap in the words contained in
the prime and in the target plays little to no role in the incremental
strengthening of the representation (Rowland et al., ). Because we
assume that
the case ambiguity of other pronouns in the paradigm
inﬂuenced the children’s use of non-nominative pronouns in subject
position in their initial development, we likewise assume that the use of
non-contrasting pronouns (you–you, it–it) in the prime added incremental

strength to the not-yet-fully-expunged non-nominative pronoun competitors
for third person feminine and masculine, her and him.

Another ﬁnding of the study was a relatively high degree of errors such as
Her covers the kitty, in which the third person singular inﬂection was used
with a non-nominative pronoun. These errors were expected, given that
previous studies using naturalistic language samples have found higher
uses of errors of this type than would be predicted by the ATOM for
children with typical development (Pine, Conti-Ramsden, Joseph, Lieven
& Serratrice, ) and for those with speciﬁc language impairment (Pine
et al., ; Wisman Weil & Leonard, ). We found an even higher
degree of such errors in the present study. Part of this eﬀect may have
been attributable to our use of repetition in the task; Shimpi et al. ()
found much greater priming in three-year-olds who repeated primes prior
to responding to the target pictures. However, recall
that structural
priming tasks with children have shown priming of verb inﬂections when
children are at a stage of using these inﬂections inconsistently in obligatory
contexts (Leonard et al., ). In the present study, for all items in both
conditions, the prompt immediately preceding the children’s response
contained a verb inﬂected for third person singular (e.g. Dad feeds her and
. . .). It seems likely, then, that this prompt served as a prime for the
children’s response. The fact that the children would combine this verb
form with a non-nominative pronoun is
in keeping with a basic
assumption of the input ambiguity hypothesis. That is, upon hearing
forms that do not vary – including those that can combine with third
person singular -s (as in It runs) – children might be slow to discard forms
such as her and him as alternatives for subject position. In our priming
task, we merely capitalized on the residual presence of these forms as
competitors for subject position in the children’s grammatical system.

This last ﬁnding has implications for several related input-based accounts
of early grammatical development, especially young children’s inconsistency
in using inﬂections that mark tense and agreement. These accounts share the
assumption that young children may not fully process input structures, such
as We saw her hug Elmo, and may as a result view the non-ﬁnite subject–verb
clause her hug Elmo as structurally unconstrained and extractable for use as a
stand-alone utterance (e.g. Coker et al., ; Freudenthal, Pine & Gobet,
; Kirjavainen et al., ; Leonard, Fey, Deevy & Bredin-Oja, ;
Theakston, Lieven & Tomasello, ). However, the ﬁndings of the
present study open up another possibility. Pronoun errors might be
mistakenly based on the assumption that non-contrasting pronouns are not
restricted to you and it, such that him and her might also serve in subject
position, possibly as an optional variation of he and she. In these instances,
him and her would not be default forms any more than it in subject
position is a default form, and therefore an agreement inﬂection could

co-occur with such pronoun forms (e.g. Her hugs Elmo). This scenario falls
completely in line with the input ambiguity hypothesis of Pelham ().
Note, furthermore, that such a possibility is not dramatically diﬀerent
from an assumption underling the ATOM. Schütze () pointed out
that if children have not yet learned he and she as lexical items, these
forms would not be available to express nominative case even if the verb
expressed overt agreement. If forms such as her can occur with third
person singular -s when she is not yet available, then it does not appear to
be a stretch to assume that her can appear with third person singular -s if
the child has not yet worked out that her does not operate like it, another
third person singular form.

Alternative interpretations of the data
For this study, we modiﬁed the standard structural priming task by
presenting paired primes. It might be argued that this procedure enabled
children to produce responses that were uncharacteristic of their everyday
speech, over and beyond the increased degree of use that would be
expected with any priming task. One possibility is that,
in the non-
contrasting condition, children heard the object pronoun in the examiner’s
prompt (as in Dad feeds her and . . .) and simply copied the pronoun to
form their own response (as in . . . her feed/feeds Minnie Mouse). This
interpretation is unable to explain why children were much less likely to
do such copying in the contrasting condition, even though the same
opportunity was available to them (e.g. Dad hugs her and . . .)

A second alternative is that the children adopted a strategy based on a more
abstract knowledge of structure, such as “X verbs Y and . . . Y verbs Z”. We
do not favor this interpretation, for several related reasons. First, it requires
considerable metalinguistic skill. The children would have to recognize that
this strategy should not be adopted when the response requires a nominative
case pronoun that diﬀers in form from the ‘Y’ pronoun in the experimenter’s
prompt (as occurred in Mom kisses me and . . .). Therefore, it seems more
consistent to assume, as we do, that children have not fully expunged her
and him as subject pronouns – a delay that we think is caused in part by
hearing you and it as both object and subject pronouns.

Second, although most children showed the expected priming eﬀect, the
diﬀerences between conditions were rarely large enough to suggest the
adoption of a strategy in one condition and not the other. Children who
seldom or never used non-nominative pronouns in the contrasting pronoun
condition produced more nominative than non-nominative pronouns in the
non-contrasting condition. Similarly, children who were consistent in using
non-nominative pronouns in the non-contrasting condition produced mostly

diﬀerence between the two conditions was as large as %; however, across all
children, the diﬀerence was closer to % (see Figure ).

Finally, there were no diﬀerences in the children’s use of pronouns as a
function of the order in which the children participated in the two
conditions. This suggests that the children who were initially in the
contrasting condition – where they were not using an “X verbs Y and . . . Y
verbs Z” strategy – would have nevertheless adopted this strategy upon
hearing perfectly grammatical prime pairs in which the object of one
sentence was of the same form as the subject of the next sentence (as in
you–you and it–it). Likewise,
it would have to be assumed that the
children who were initially in the non-contrasting condition readily
abandoned the strategy when participating in the contrasting pronoun
condition.

In short, the assumptions that must be made for this strategy to be viable
seem to be riskier than our position that children who have not yet fully
expunged non-nominative pronoun forms from subject position are more
likely to use these pronoun forms upon hearing pronouns in the prime
whose form does not vary with case. Indeed, the input ambiguity of such
unchanging pronouns may have been an important factor in the children’s
use of him and her in subject position in the ﬁrst place.

The Agreement/Tense Omission Model revisited
Results of this study are not wholly incompatible with generative accounts of
pronoun use during language development, such as the ATOM. However,
these results may instead help to ﬁll gaps in the ATOM and explain why
children produce errors such as Him runs. The ATOM predicts that these
errors should not occur because when a verb is marked for agreement,
such as with the third person singular -s inﬂection, correct pronoun case
(nominative, He runs) should occur. Within the ATOM framework, errors
such as Him runs are therefore never or rarely supposed to occur except
due to an occasional performance error.

This study provides evidence that contradicts this aspect of the ATOM
account. The results show that for children in the OI stage, input that
includes pronouns with no case contrast and frequent verbs marked for
third person singular -s can prime children to be almost equally likely to
produce sentences such as Him hugs Elmo as they are to produce He hugs
Elmo. It
is not clear how such use could be promoted so easily if
agreement expressed on the verb automatically translates to the licensing
of nominative case on the pronoun in subject position. It seems more
likely that, in the period of development captured in this study, him and
her were not fully consolidated as forms that mark object case only. This
was likely inﬂuenced by the fact that some pronoun forms (you, it) are not

restricted to object case but can mark nominative case as well. In addition,
him and her occasionally appear in the input as subjects of verbs as in Let’s
watch her chase the boy whereas he and she never appear as direct objects.
This combination of input factors could make him and her candidates for
misuse. Modiﬁcation in the input such as through priming could then
exaggerate such misuse.

At present, the ATOM seems to have provisions only for the possibility
that a child might not have acquired he and she as lexical items. With he
and she absent from the lexicon, him and her might continue to be used in
subject position even when verbs marked for agreement begin to be used.
Once he and she have been acquired, use during the OI period should
alternate between he and she with verbs marked for agreement, and him
and her with non-ﬁnite verbs. Based on the ﬁndings of the present study,
it might be that this transition is more gradual. Him and her might not be
immediately replaced in subject position but
instead drop out more
gradually at a rate determined in part by the input. The presence of other
pronoun forms in the input that do not diﬀer as a function of case (such as
you and it) might be one of the factors that inﬂuences this rate.

C O N C L U S I O N S
Our ﬁndings point towards a need for a theory of tense/agreement acquisition
that accounts for inﬂuences of input-driven factors as well as hard-wired
universal grammar principles. This investigation – inspired by the ambiguity
hypothesis of Pelham () – has demonstrated that input-based factors can
account for error patterns produced by children that are not otherwise
explained by dominant accounts of tense/agreement development such as
the ATOM. It is likely that children may be especially susceptible to
input-driven factors during certain stages of development and more
susceptible to hard-wired principles during other stages. The OI stage of
development is a time in which some of these inﬂuences may compete with
one another, leading children to produce grammatical errors.
