1. FOREWORD.
Aiming at analyzing the effects of the internationalization of universities, a
joint research team from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM) and Hong
Kong University (HKU) studied the socialization process experienced by a group
of Chinese and Spanish students enrolled in mobility programs. Since exchange
students must show ﬂuency in both relational and academic discourses (which
includes the ability to move through institutional and social spaces with ease;
Blommaert 2013), we tried to identify which practices international students
deploy in order to enter the alien environment. To do so, we traced a group of
exchange undergraduates and analyzed their interactional practices at
institutional and non-institutional spaces. The socialization networks in
which students take part are suitable sites for analyzing the negotiation of
ideologies and subjectivities, and for exploring the relationship between
stancetaking and recent forms of cosmopolitanism.
This is why, in this paper, we address such networks in our analysis of a
communicative event situated on the fringe of a focus group (a research
technique) and an informal gathering (naturally situated interaction). Over a
dinner party organized to inaugurate the research project in Madrid, the
participants (two local researchers, five Chinese students and two local
students, one originally from Taiwan) share meanings, recall semiotic
resources to interpret the meaning of elements of sociocultural life, jointly
construct intersubjectivities and negotiate their social identities within
interaction (Jaworski and Thurlow 2009). However, shared enactments of
stance require complex strategies that go beyond the customary understanding
of stance negotiation (cf. Jaffe 2009 for an overview of sociolinguistic research
on stance). In this respect, our paper aims at making two contributions.
On the one hand, within sociolinguistic theory, it explores the extent to
which sociocultural and ideological factors underlie stance alignment and the
collective construction of identities (intersubjectivity being the link between
both threads). On the other hand, concerning cosmopolitanism, we advance a
more nuanced approach to the notion based on positioning. Cosmopolitanism
remains an elusive concept, both in its definition and in its various kinds. The
subjects in our study position themselves as cosmopolitans, but not in ways
that distinctly reflect an ‘ability to stand outside of having one’s life written and
scripted by any one community’ (Vertovec and Cohen 2002: 4). Rather, their
cosmopolitanism points to a globalization of tastes resulting from increasingly
multicultural societies and widespread capitalism (Calhoun 2002). However,
in spite of sharing a cosmopolitan orientation, significant ideological
contradictions emerged during the interaction, and negotiation was required
to overcome the misalignments. The analysis of these tensions shows the
extent to which all the elements involved in the stancetaking process
(evaluation, positioning, and the definition and framing of the object of
stance) are shaped by social values and ideologies.
In order to present our contributions, the paper is organized as follows. After
this introduction, the theoretical frame is presented in section 2. The
communicative event is described in section 3. Section 4 analyzes two case
studies (one on bullfighting, another on shopping trips to European capitals)
excerpted from the transcription of the video-recorded event (see the Appendix
for transcription conventions). A rounding-up discussion of cosmopolitanism is
presented in section 5, and the main conclusions are summarized in section 6.
2. DIALOGICAL POSITIONING: FROM SITUATEDNESS TO IDEOLOGIES
We follow a fine-grained discourse analytic approach (drawing from the fields
of the ethnography of communication, the micro-ethnography of social
interaction and sociolinguistic ethnography) that highlights the role of local
complexities in interactional activities. Often, supposedly stable social processes
are projected onto discourse as background facts (Blommaert and Bulcaen
2000; Rampton 2001). Such an aprioristic approach conceals how
participants, in particular situations, enact language patterns in unexpected,
creative and heterodox ways (Gumperz 1982; Roberts, Davies and Jupp 1992;
Rampton 2001). At the same time, we think that ideologies and social
processes (such as cosmopolitanism, the internationalization of universities or
consumption patterns in global societies) should be part of the analysis, since
interactions shape and are shaped by other social practices and processes
across space and time (Heller 2006, 2011; Rampton 2006).
Stancetaking implies an evaluative, affective and cognitive act to which
participants react. For this reason, our study of dialogical positioning addresses
the interplay between intersubjectivity and interactional stances. However, our
study of stance is not restricted to the situated interactional level, but moves
onto the ideological domain of constructed values. During the collaborative
process of successive stance realignments upon which the construction of
intersubjectivities rests, the sociocultural values and beliefs deployed by the
participants have a most significant impact.
As presented by Du Bois (2007), the stance alignment process rests upon a
coincident evaluation and positioning with regard to a given object (Figure 1),
and both the mediating framework of linguistic structures and the values
invoked by participants are crucial factors. To our mind, however, the
successive reframing of the object itself is also crucial, since it allows the
emergence of new stances upon which alignment can happen.
In Du Bois’s approach (2007: 141), ‘sociocultural value is mobilized and
deployed through stance processes. Via specific acts of stancetaking, value can be
focused and directed at a precise target, as locally relevant values are activated to
frame the significance of participant actions’. Also (2007: 173), ‘stance always
invokes, explicitly or implicitly, presupposed systems of sociocultural value,
while at the same time contributing to the enactment and reproduction of those
systems’. Our proposal places much more emphasis on sociocultural values and
ideologies for a number of reasons: to begin with, stances are interactional moves
in which face (Goffman 1967) is negotiated, and face is rooted in sociocultural
values. These values, as we will see, shape the positioning of interlocutors and
the co-construction of intersubjectivities. Secondly, stances are also moves in
which the expression of values and beliefs can trigger misunderstandings,
particularly if the participants were first socialized in significantly different
settings and conditions. Finally, sociocultural values and ideologies are evoked to
reframe and redefine the object of stance, which is therefore not a static and
automatically shared entity, but an object of collision. In fact, as discussed below,
repeated enactments of stance ingrain particular subject positions layered into
particular ideologies (Jaffe 2009; Jaworski and Thurlow 2009). Along these
lines, the pages that follow address a series of research questions:
1. To what extent do convergence and divergence depend on the accretive
co-construction of the stance object? What role do sociocultural values
and ideologies play in such a reframing of the object, and how does it
allow for repositioning and alignment? Which role do interactional moves
(such as contextualization in interactional inferential processes and
accretion) play in stance alignment within multicultural dialogical
interactions? These questions, in relation to interactional stancetaking,
are addressed in section 4.1.
2. What communicative practices foster the interactional construction of a
cosmopolitan-oriented identity among young mobile citizens? What kinds
of cosmopolitanism do they exhibit? What (local and/or transnational)
cultural experiences and ideologies are they based on? These questions, in
relation to cosmopolitanism, are addressed in section 4.2.

3. AN INFORMAL DINNER AS A SETTING FOR INTERCULTURAL COMMUNICATION.
Once the Chinese exchange students (registered in language and communication
classes taught in Spanish and/or English by the local researchers) had
volunteered to take part in the project, an informal launching gathering took
place at the home of one of the researchers. Despite the difficulties of being a
lecturer, a participant and an analyst at the same time, our multi-faceted position
was particularly valuable, as it allowed tracing the students’ everyday life at the
university with both participant and non-participant observation for an
extended period. The five exchange students taking part in the event included
three women (student 1, aged 20; student 2, aged 20; and student 3, aged 19)
and two men (student 4, aged 20; and student 5, aged 21). They came from small
cities in northern and southern China, but studied elsewhere: four had been
taking Spanish for three years at the International Studies University of Beijing;
another one at the Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangdong. In all cases, their first
language was Mandarin (one also spoke Cantonese) and all of them had studied
English for years (student 3 was schooled at a private bilingual school).
While in Madrid, the two men (students 4 and 5) shared a flat with a
Spanish student of Chinese (with whom student 4 had become friends in
Beijing when the Spanish student was on exchange); among the females,
students 1 and 2 also shared a flat; student 3 lived at the UAM hall of
residence, where she only spoke Spanish. The rest spoke Chinese at home,
although all of them were friends with Spanish and international classmates,
with whom they socialized a lot. Among them, the exchange students used
WeChat to text one another in Chinese, but used WhatsApp to communicate
in Spanish with their UAM classmates. Their Spanish was good (a B2 level
upon arrival in Madrid) and they achieved top grades while at UAM. This is not
surprising if considering that, in China, they had entered university through a
very competitive process which only allows one student per province, and that
their home universities selected them for the exchange program because of
their excellent academic records. Of the destinations available for a semester
abroad, the decisive factor for choosing Spain rather than Latin America was
security, and the reason for choosing UAM was its location in a capital city.
Our students make for an affluent set: although none had ever been in an
exchange program before, all of them (except student 4) had travelled abroad as
tourists in Asia (Korea, Japan, Singapore). Their friends and family had
commissioned them to bring luxury brands as presents from the (many) trips
they took while in Europe. They always had lunch on campus even if the class
timetable allowed them to go home. They all thought Madrid was a safe, friendly
and inexpensive place and, having anticipated rejection, they were surprised at
the welcome they received from their Spanish classmates. While other Chinese
friends and classmates initially identified as potential participants for the study
finally chose not to take part, the core group remained committed to the project
and their overall impression of their stay abroad was very positive.
In addition to the exchange students, a female Taiwanese PhD candidate in
linguistics at UAM, also the deputy director of a travel agency specializing in
luxury Chinese tourism in Spain living in Madrid for over 10 years and with
Spanish nationality, attended the gathering. Also present was a male Spanish
undergraduate atUAMrecently returned froman exchange in France,who audiovideo
recorded the event and eventually ended up playing a significant role in it.
The local researchers, both female, were there too. They have a long record of
academic experiences abroad, in Europe and in the U.S., and one experiences
interculturality at home. They both lecture on communication in intercultural
settings and often involve students in their research. At the meeting, they overtly
displayed their positioning regarding a number of controversial topics (such as
bullfighting or Franco’s dictatorship). This, which is common practice in Spain (a
country fraught with political and ideological strife, particularly at the time of the
gathering, with the economic crisis at its peak) was the source of struggle. In
communicative events, participants extract a range of salient biographical
information about co-participants that will impact into their stance
interpretation, in addition to what the speaker is saying (Du Bois 2007: 155).
On this occasion, there was virtually no previous acquaintance among most of
the participants, so the negotiation of meaning proved challenging, and a
considerable amount of contextualization was required for reaching alignment.
The communicative event, convivial and easy-going, lasted for two and a
half hours and can be divided into two parts: the dinner, buffet-style around a
table; and after dinner, when the participants sat in sofas and armchairs and
chatted about various aspects of the exchange program and about life in Spain
and China. The recorded material was transcribed in full and translated into
English; the fragments in standard modern Chinese were also transcribed and
translated (see the Appendix for transcription conventions).
4. STANCETAKING IN INTERCULTURAL CONTEXTS: NEGOTIATING COSMOPOLITANISM.
4.1 Struggling with national identities: The controversial condition of being
a Spaniard
The gathering starts with a buffet-style dinner where everyone stands around the
table and tastes different dishes. This is the first time the participants meet outside
the university context, some have never met before, and all of them have to
renegotiate their relationships. The analysis of the first fragment (4.33 minutes
altogether) allows us to delve deeper into the role of the experience lived by the
exchange students and how they intersubjectively position themselves with
regard to local values. The selection takes place during the first half hour of the
meeting, once everyone has been introduced to each other and the ice has been
broken. At one point (turn 4), the convivial ambiance is unexpectedly disturbed.
The fragment deals with a culturally salient activity, bullfighting, which is both a
touristy must-have and the source of bitter confrontation among Spaniards.
While increasingly large numbers of Spanish citizens demand the end of
bullfighting, many tourists still attend a show; reproducing what Hannerz
(1996: 103) calls a genuine form of cosmopolitanism: ‘an orientation, a
willingness to engage with the Other. It entails an intellectual and esthetic
openness toward divergent cultural experiences, a search for contrasts rather
than uniformity. To become acquainted with more cultures is to turn into an
aficionado’. This is why negotiating stances in relation to bullfighting becomes a
significant concern for the Chinese exchange students, as it affects their
enactment of cosmopolitanism.
The fragment begins with the local student and researcher 1 coconstructing
the question of whether the exchange students have been
taken on excursions outside Madrid. Students 4 and 1 advance the same
answer at about the same time: a university-based student organization
seeking to facilitate the integration of exchange students took them to
Toledo, a sightseeing city. At this point, the nonverbal aspects of the
interaction available from the video become salient. As researcher 1 says,
‘Have you (pl) gone to the bullfights?’ (turn 4) her voice becomes louder,
her eyes widen as she looks directly at student 4 and leans slightly in his
direction. Her eyebrows rise and the phrase ends in a marked intonation,
slightly up and then down. Hearing ‘Toledo’ as ‘bullfight’ comes from the
phonetic resemblance of ‘torero’ (bullfighter) with a possible equivalence of
‘r’ and ‘l’ in Chinese followed by a softened second ‘r’ phoneme. The
combination of gaze, body posture, volume and intonation suggests an
evaluative reaction to the notion that the exchange students have attended
a bullfight. Du Bois (2007: 143) understands evaluation as the process
whereby a stancetaker orients to an object of stance and characterizes it as
having some specific quality or value. Here, researcher 1 is taking an
evaluative stance on attending bullfights, and although the nature of the
evaluation is not entirely clear, the final downward intonation suggests
negativity. Students 4 and 1 (turns 5 and 7) both repeat ‘Toledo’ in slightly
louder voices, making clear that their pronunciation of ‘l’ was intentional.
Researcher 1 repeats ‘AH, TOLE:DO’ to confirm that she now understands
the reference was to a city, not bullfights, and specifies her previous
response with ‘I understood bullfight’, in a softer tone. Physically, she leans
back and gazes away from the students, smiling.
The trouble, however, has just begun. Students 1 and 4 overlap
researcher 1’s response invoking bullfights to say that they have actually
attended one. Her response (‘that TOO?’ in turn 11) is louder and ends in
an upward intonation. Her eyes widen, she looks directly at student 1,
shakes her head briefly, then gazes off camera in the direction of researcher
2 and the Spanish student. The gaze shift, combined with the headshake
and pause that follows it, suggest disbelief. The whole set of turns in this
interaction shows how all the participants dispute the floor to either confirm
some have actually attended a bullfight or to express incredulity about it.
The dispute inaugurates a long-lasting stance accretion process by means of
which the gradual accumulation of repeatedly taken stances in the run of
conversation ends up making for reinforced, enduring positionings and
identity structures (Du Bois 2002; Rauniomaa 2003). In this respect,
observe how researcher 1 positions herself: ‘I’ve never been to a bullfight.
Never, never, never, nor . . .’ (turn 16), somehow forcing the object of
stance, which could have gone back to sightseeing but remains at
bullfighting. The subjective dimension is overtly indexed by discrete
linguistic elements (i.e. personal pronouns and a reiterated negation) that
reveal the subject’s feelings and positions her along a scale of affective
value. These linguistic elements are also contextualization cues (cf. Gumperz
1982, for a theory of interactional inferential processing): the emphatic use
of the first-person pronoun in a null subject language, which presupposes a
contrast between her and those who attend bullfights; and the repetition of
‘never’, which contributes to the management of information.
With both resources, researcher 1 is helping her interlocutors interpret what
the object of her stance is, and what the nature of the stance she is taking is.
Student 4’s laugh, as an interactional answer, may suggest hesitation and
stress. In turn 19, researcher 2 aligns with researcher 1’s stance: ‘I will never
go, I mean, I haven’t gone and I’m not going to go’. Once again, the personal
pronoun marks a contrast with those who do; also again, the reinforcement of
‘no’ with ‘never’ act as contextualization cues with regard to the general
interactional framework (Martın Rojo and Meeuwis 1993). In choosing these
cues, researcher 2 restricts the field of application and emphasizes the lack of
alignment. In adopting this stance, she entails a positioning with which
researcher 1 aligns, although she tries to mitigate the interactional
consequences of the stance misalignment and its impact on face-work
(Goffman 1967). Here we see intersubjectivity in action, when the subjective
stances of two participants coincide within a dialogic exchange and, at the
same time, collide with the positioning of others. Researcher 1’s reiteration of
her questions (‘but did you go?’) and other markers such as intonation, which
point to incredulity, act as cues to indicate to the interlocutor that these are not
genuine questions, but illocutionary acts expressing rejection. This explains
why student 1 feels it is necessary to justify herself (Fragment 1.2, turn 24):
Fragment 1.2 starts with ‘but’, which shows student 1 has clearly detected the
cues and has interpreted the researchers’ stances as a disagreeing negative
evaluation, so she provides a counterargument: ‘but since at the beginning we
wanted to see what are the Spanish culture like’ (turn 24). Her justification is
also an attempt to reframe the object of stance. As Jaworski and Thurlow
(2009) and Thurlow and Jaworski (2011) note, willingness to engage with
local people and culture is a form of ‘cosmopolitanism’. This explains why
student 1 reframes attending bullfights as a ‘cultural activity’, and generalizes
it to the whole group (‘we’). The shift allows detecting two significant
phenomena. First, that the object of stance in interactions is not necessarily
static and shared, as suggested by Du Bois, but reframed and redefined by
successive alignments and misalignments. Secondly, that sociocultural and
ideological elements are part of the process of reframing and redefining the
object of stance (which goes beyond Du Bois’ acknowledgement of the role of
sociocultural elements in the evaluation taken by participants). The
willingness to become involved with the other as a form of cosmopolitanism,
and the concern with achieving competence at a foreign culture also relate to
considerations of the self (Hannerz 1996). In this respect, observe how (in turn
24) student 1 is also contributing to building face, both hers and that of the
group, by presenting their attendance at a bullfight as a sign of the interest to
be expected from an international student willing to become part of the host
culture. Their trip to the bulls is therefore an attempt to approach the other
(and also, as discussed in section 5, a form of ‘consumerist cosmopolitanism’).
The enunciation, however, opens a new dimension of the controversy: what
the exchange students understand as ‘Spanish culture’ clashes with the
opinion of the locals, who do not regard bullfighting as any form of culture
(‘torture is neither art nor culture’ is a popular motto in Spain). We observe
how, by means of relating bullfighting and cultural traditions, the object of
stance is gradually shifting while the participants co-build their subjectivities.
In this fragment, the mediating role of the Taiwanese PhD student stands
out (turns 36 and 39). Recall she was at one point an exchange student, but
has now been living in Madrid for years. Her stance aligns with that of the
locals, but she admits that, like the international students, she did once go to a
bullfight. With her evaluative stance, she shows how rejecting a local cultural
event does not threaten the image of the host interlocutors. This opens the
door for students 1 and 4 to state their displeasure regarding certain aspects of
the bullfight. From this moment on, the movements of all the interlocutors
(which now also include students 5 and 2) bring stances closer: researcher 1
recognizes an interesting folklore aspect in bullfighting (turn 41) and
researcher 2 (turn 43) recognizes it may have a deeper anthropological
value (although she ends up saying, ‘but I’m not interested’). Both moves point
towards an alignment regarding bullfighting, now reframed as a cultural good.
However, students 1 and 4 make a new move in the construction of face (turns
44 and 46), and find a new space for the co-construction of intersubjectivity
which is ideological in nature. These students start a narrative that describes the
savage nature of the show and take a stance over which there is widespread
agreement: the fight is a bloody and unfair practice. Later on in the conversation,
subtle degrees of affection (‘it’s not fair’) and agreement (‘I agree’) would align
stances. As participants gradually converge after a conflictive process of accretive
stancetaking, affective stance gradually became more explicit (‘I don’t like it’, ‘I
dislike it’). The connection between stance alignment and intersubjectivity also
comes to the fore. However, the movement also seems to announce a new
reframing of the stance object. From this moment on, the divergence there was
with regard to the object of the stance, whether attending bullfights is
worthwhile or a practice to be avoided, a cultural event or a brutal tradition,
has gradually converged around the shared condemnation of violence.
Regarding the latter there is alignment, as displayed in the fragment that follows.
In this excerpt, several accretive evaluative stances point to less bloody
variants of bullfighting, a preferred alternative for all the participants. Having
arrived at a point of agreement following the previous misalignment, all
participants co-build their subjectivity as people who reject animal abuse, an
ideological position they all share. The national issue reappears in this
fragment, in both cases evoked by researcher 1, who first refers to a
neighboring country that keeps the tradition without sacrificing the bull, then
to an underlying issue: the controversial declaration of bullfighting as ‘the
national fiesta’, a category it was included in during Franco’s rule. Her
sarcastic comment (turn 56) shifts the stance object once more, reframing it
within the political arena. The association of the ‘fiesta’ not with Spanish
culture but with politics and, more specifically, with the Francoist definition of
the Spanish identity and the one-sided use of some traditions would appear
again later on in the conversation. At that time, researcher 1 recalled the
recurrent broadcasting of bullfights at prime time when she was a child, and
the Spanish student stressed the fabricated nature of the fiesta. Thus, what had
started as small talk ended up reflecting the controversies that exist between
different value systems, and helped redefine bullfighting not as cultural good,
but as a political issue.
The evocation of the ‘fiesta nacional’, an expression coined during Franco’s
regime, is a very effective resource for reframing the stance object and
reorganizing the alignment process. In the dialogic construction of
intersubjectivity, the local participants want to remove themselves from
elements considered from abroad (among some Spaniards too) a salient part of
Spanish culture, in spite of the decadence of a tradition which has already been
banned in some parts of the country. In doing so, they question its essentiality
and bring the international students closer to a more complex reality: there is
still a division between the so-called ‘two Spains’. As Jaworski and Thurlow
(2009) point out, stances (particularly if they are accretively constructed) are
unavoidably sites of ideological constructions and contestation. The bullfight
episode closes with the alignment of all the participants, who jointly manage to
create an intersubjectivity removed from the national boundaries the debate
started with.
With regard to the questions we posed for this section, we already have some
answers. Throughout the negotiation to fix the shifting object of stance, and
through successive convergences and divergences over the value system they
relate to, intersubjectivity emerges as individuals within a group who condemn
violent traditional practices. Within the construction of the stance object and
the stance alignment process, three factors have proven crucial:
contextualization, inferencing and stance accretion. The outcomes of such a
complex procedure are significant: not only intersubjectivity has been built; the
participants have also co-constructed their social identities. Having reached
this point, the conversation changes topic and moves onto football. Just
beforehand, laughter suggests an alignment has been reached and the face of
all the participants has been saved. All in all, the foregoing section has shown
that:
1. stance objects are negotiated and gradually co-constructed within
interaction in a shared attempt to build a working consensus;
2. sociocultural values and ideologies shape face-work; and
3. intersubjectivity is the link joining both strands.
Through this negotiation of stance towards bullfighting, the Chinese students
may be able to position themselves as more sophisticated cosmopolitan
subjects, who do not simply view local cultural traditions as exotic, but show
sensitivity to values shared with local people, such as the humane treatment of
animals.
4.2 From local to cosmopolitan: The distinction of being a citizen of the world.
Once dinner was over, the participants started an after-dinner chat, now sitting
down. The conversation kicks off with a question from researcher 2 about the
exchange students’ plans for the Christmas break. This particular fragment
(Fragment 2.1) starts with spatial and temporal deixis pointing at the mobility
scenario and the opportunities that the location provides: ‘And now that you
are here, you’ll take the chance to go to other countries’ (turn 57). The referent
‘here’ is both Spain and the city of Madrid, to which they refer on several
occasions as a place from which is it easy to get to other European capitals. The
turn initiates a conversation in which the stances taken by the participants can
be understood as reflections of different ways of being cosmopolitan. Their value
systems, however, are different, which triggers misalignments between some
for whom luxury shopping is endowed with a romantic allure and others with a
more pragmatic orientation, who favor budget deals. At this point, the cultural
premises that contextualize the object of stance are sometimes problematic once
again. The fragments (4.50 minutes altogether) show how the interpretation of
the stance object is not always shared. Thus, during their dialogue,
interlocutors have to agree on what the object of stance is, and to modify the
value system that frames the stance object.
Fragment 2.1 comes 45 minutes later than Fragment 1.3 and starts with
researcher 2’s suggestion of taking advantage of the location for traveling.
Three exchange students respond affirmatively to researcher 2’s question: their
plans include visiting other European cities. The aim of such trips is quickly
specified: ‘to shop, to shop’ (turn 59). As student 1 mentions shopping twice in
rapid succession, student 4 confirms the point (‘yes yes yes’), after which
student 1 expands on the statement: shopping over Christmas will happen not
just in Paris, but also in Italy. Her laughter and the burst of unintelligible
overlapping talk that follows highlight the emphasis placed on shopping as the
reason for travelling abroad. Later on in the evening, student 5 would
comment on the cultural interest of Italy, but at this point nothing but
shopping is mentioned. Although no explicit evaluation is produced by the
local participants, the Spanish student starts his turn with a counter
argumentative marker (‘but’) and a request for confirmation (turn 62).
Researcher 2’s subsequent utterance suggests that shopping could happen in
Madrid as well, which is implicitly a negative evaluation of the stance object,
i.e. shopping trips. She responds to students 1 and 4’s stance, comparing price
reductions in Madrid with prices elsewhere. Although the full statement is
unintelligible, both researcher 2 and the local student seem to be suggesting
that the exchange students might find better prices in Madrid (in fact, the full
transcript reveals that researcher 2 had unsuccessfully tried to introduce the
point three times already). The sales imaginary (turn 83) evoked by the
researcher, focused on budgeting, clearly contrasts with the glamorous
imaginary the students have in mind: luxury shopping in Paris and Milan,
as we will soon discover. Hence, there is a conflictive misalignment regarding
shopping and what shopping means.
To understand the alignment dynamics, we need to explore
contextualization in further detail, tracing salient indexical meanings and
identifying those aspects of context that participants must know to gather a
successful interpretation of stances. To do so, we pay particular attention to
how the contextualization move of the Taiwanese PhD candidate (the only
participant familiar with both sociocultural contexts) creates the necessary
common ground. Her move (turn 63) provides information that contributes to
the contextual definition of the object in relation to which stance is being
taken, i.e. luxury brands. Hence, in helping reframe the stance object, she is
paving the way for alignment. In further conversation, the exchange students
would complete the contextual information highlighting the obstacles to
finding luxury brands in China at even less affordable prices, and explaining
how their families had specifically asked for these products as travel presents.
The foregoing fragment has shown our participants taking a different stance
in relation to the object (i.e. shopping abroad as an opportunity for purchasing
luxury items versus shopping abroad as seeking cheaper deals). Despite the
differences, both stances can be seen as different ways of being cosmopolitan,
in that both groups profess their knowledge and experience of traveling to
different places in the world. Thus, the fragment reveals the complex relation
between consumption and cosmopolitanism (a more detailed discussion is
presented in section 5). The reference to the (very hard to obtain) visa needed
for the Chinese exchange students to go to Britain shows cosmopolitanism is
still a mode of social stratification. Likewise, the fact that relatives put in orders
for branded items shows that, for these students, mobility is also a means of
gaining access to social distinction (Bourdieu 1984).
The fact that both groups display cosmopolitan-oriented stances allows
addressing another research question, namely, the extent to which the
enactment of cosmopolitanism depends on encounters with interlocutors who
themselves exhibit cosmopolitan features. In this regard, the romantic imaginary
put forward in Fragment 2.2 forms the basis for going beyond the initial lack of
alignment about shopping. In turn 84, researcher 2 restates her original
question in the form of an affirmative statement, and a negotiation ensues among
the participants in an attempt to align stances. During the process, the mediating
role of the Taiwanese PhD student stands out once again.
In turn 86, the PhD student provides information she considers local
participants must bear in mind in order to contextually ground and
understand their co-positioning. In doing so, she is introducing sociocultural
differences between Asia and Europe and displaying ethnic identities. The use
of the deictic ‘there’ builds an implicit opposition between ‘there’ and ‘here’,
reframing the interaction in cultural terms. In choosing to mediate this way,
she is assuming the participants do not have enough information about each
other to make sense of differences. Once France and Italy have been targeted as
the desired destinations for the holidays, the Taiwanese student makes the
premise behind such travelling explicit: ‘there in Asia it seems like a dream’.
Researcher 2’s alignment (turn 87), an endorsement of the stance of the
exchange students, draws laughter and incomprehensible comments. Her cleft
sentence emphasizes the lack of differences (‘to me’ [stance subject], ‘too’
[position]) and neutralizes the PhD student’s polarization, thus bringing the
subjective positions into alignment. Laughter eliminates the tension of previous
moves, and researcher 1 (turn 89) immediately adheres to the newly emerged
alignment. This is not constructed on the grounds of shopping, nor on the idea
of it being an impossible dream (unlikely within a setting in which the
destination is already geographically close and travelling already a reality for
these students), but rather on the romance attached to the destinations. The
common acknowledgement of France and Italy as romantic places reveals the
presence of a shared object of stance, and that the participants share sociocultural
values too. The statement of the Spanish student in turn 91 (‘but later
on you will’), aimed at the only person who disagrees, levels all the
participants. The shared imaginary is clearly a sign of distinction for all of
them. Nothing to do with the practical logic of low-cost flights avoiding and
high prices implicit in researcher 2’s recommendation which led to the former
misalignment (a logic from which, for the sake of alignment, she distances
herself in turn 94, which elicits laughter as a welcoming response). The
alignment on the romantic nature of transnational mobility marks a departure
from the consumerist dimension of cosmopolitanism. In fact, besides the
‘consumption’ of foreign places, both exchange students and locals come up as
global connoisseurs who perform cosmopolitan practices in their interaction.
Overall, the foregoing section has shown:
1. the relevance of common ground for understanding stances and reaching
points of interactional alignment;
2. the impact of ideologies in the alignment process; and
3. how some current forms of cosmopolitanism (e.g. the consumption of
romantic places) tend to trigger alignment much more expediently than
others (e.g. the consumption of luxury goods).
5. COSMOPOLITANISM REVISITED FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF STANCETAKING.
So far, we have observed the enactment of cosmopolitanism in interaction. The
orientation of our participants towards different cultures and locations
constitute interactional-level manifestations of cosmopolitanism, and the
analysis of the fragments reveals the many tendencies and strands that
coexist within cosmopolitanism. The participants in our study might be seen as
exemplars of today’s cosmopolitanism. They can be said to be cosmopolitans in
that they manage to make their way into other settings and successfully
renegotiate meanings. However, we cannot assess the extent to which they are
indeed developing a symbolic personal repertoire (along the lines of the
cosmopolitan competence suggested by Hannerz 2004; Vertovec and Rogers
1998). This is why, although they present themselves as such, our participants
cannot be unmistakably called cosmopolitans nor the opposite.
Nonetheless, they do seem to enact some of the main trends detected in the
literature in relation to current forms of cosmopolitanism. The bullfighting case
study reveals how international students act as tourists (albeit with an academic
slant) and, although they dip into the national culture of the host community,
they remain rooted in their own culture at the point of origin: this is why
mediators are needed to ‘get the point’. We therefore acknowledge the presence
of a form of ‘touristy’ cosmopolitanism that includes the search for varied
experiences and a delight in understanding contrasts between societies rather
than a longing for uniformity or superiority, as well as the development of some
skills at interpreting cultural meanings (Vertovec and Cohen 2002). However,
as Hannerz (1996: 103) notices, cosmopolitans do not accept particular
elements of the alien culture and refuse others; they do not negotiate with the
other culture, but rather accept it as a package deal. And this is precisely where
tensions emerge. Locals, even if oriented towards cosmopolitanism, cannot
embrace culture as a package, because they are committed to it and need to face
and act against the cultural elements they reject. This tendency to see the
experience of cultural diversity as a value in itself is linked to Urry’s (1995)
notion of ‘aesthetic cosmopolitanism’, by means of which not only elites, but
also tourists (and, in this case, international students) have developed more
cosmopolitan or far-reaching aesthetic tastes. The consumption of foreign places
seems to be based on exoticism, on commodification and on a consumerist
culture (for a revision of the notion of commodification, cf. Pujolar 2017).
However, engaging with locals and negotiation stances, international students
face the contradictions raised by superficial cultural immersions, and they
develop cultural competence in the stricter sense of the term.
The analysis of the fragments on shopping reveals another significant trend
in relation to current forms of cosmopolitanism. Although the excerpt does not
allow discerning if the reason behind Paris and Milan-based shopping goes
beyond the actual purchase of goods, it clearly points to a distinction-seeking
identity-building practice: I got it in Paris. Following Jaworski and Thurlow
(2009: 196), we observe how a form of elitism is enacted by:
making a claim to exclusivity, superiority, and/or distinctiveness on the grounds
of status, knowledge, authenticity, taste, erudition, experience, insight, wealth,
or any other quality warranting the speaker/author to take a higher moral,
aesthetic, intellectual, material, or any other form of standing in relation to
another subject (individual or group).
In this respect, places are significant. As the analysis reveals, specific cultural
practices and commodities offer a means of self-definition that removes subjects
from a restrictive local context. Also indisputably, it reveals that cosmopolitanism
is linked to transnational mobility and distinction. To be sure, there is cultural
capital in saying ‘I amoff to Paris nextweek’, just asmuch capital as in the actual
Chanel scarf eventually bought there. Would the same scarf carry less value if
bought during a January sale inMadrid? Probably not: it is not the object itself that
lends distinction to contemporary cosmopolitans, but having bought it at the right
place, just as having had a picture taken at whatever iconic spot (Thurlow and
Jaworski 2011). Participants in this interaction were socialized in particular
consumption patterns at one place but currently they are relocated, again as
customers, in another one (Hannerz 1996: 153). As a result, they have access to
commodities, such as luxury brand names, that have a significant part of their
value derived fromtheir original (and not peripheral) location/locus of production.
Thus, the analysis of the shopping case study seems to refer to what Calhoun
(2002) describes as ‘consumerist cosmopolitanism’, manifested in the
globalization of tastes (such as the massive transfer of foodstuff, artworks,
music, literature and fashion), which represents the multiculturalization of
society, and also the advanced globalization of capitalism. As Calhoun notes,
cosmopolitanism still refers to ‘the class consciousness of frequent travellers’; it is
embodied in the emergent culture of the transnational capitalist class described by
Sklair (2000). In being associated with such elites, cosmopolitanismis nowlargely
a matter of consumption, an acquired taste for cultural artifacts from around the
world. However, concerning these consumption patterns, spatial and ideological
positions give rise to contradictions.
Finally, in connection with places, our paper shows a diversification of origins:
a Chinese elite is now being formed under the auspices, among others, of
university internationalization schemes and exchange programs. The
transnational capitalist class, however, is only a small fragment of the
population. Mobility is endowed with nuances that go further beyond
travelling itself, and this is clearly linked to social inequality: some subjects can
travel the world, others cannot or not to every country; some can access given
consumer goods, others cannot. If cosmopolitanism is a matter of distinction, it
must be recognized by others beyond biographic and/or cultural differences.

6. CONCLUSION.
To conclude, let us review the most significant contributions of our study. First,
and in relation to stancetaking, we have shown that the actual objects of stance
are a matter for negotiation, and cultural values and ideologies play a crucial role
in the process. Interacting with participants from different backgrounds is always
a source of uncertainty and often the reason behind inconsistent stances. For this
reason, we propose an interactional understanding of stancetaking that overtly
focuses on the negotiation of stance objects. Objects are not static items situated
outside the interaction: their meaning fluctuates and, therefore, their coconstruction
is as dialogic as positioning itself. The contextualization and
negotiation of stance objects, as well as stance accretion, allows participants to
interpret the positioning of others and gradually construct compatible
subjectivities. In intercultural settings, misalignments are often the result of
misunderstandings because stance objects are implicit and the background
knowledge that participants evoke does not coincide. In positioning themselves,
subjects respond both to the stances of others and to the values rooted in a
community. For this reason, the stance triangle model (Figure 1) should expand
to accommodate the sociocultural and ideological aspects without which
contextualization cannot succeed.
Secondly, interactional negotiations are inherently related to the coconstruction
of interpersonal relations. For this reason, face-work stands out
as a key factor within the dialogical negotiation of stance. At this point,
cultural values and ideologies play a crucial role as well: presenting oneself as a
cosmopolite is a social asset that provides interactional legitimacy. In
negotiating face and co-constructing identities, many stances and responses
within interaction have a sense of it being ‘the right thing to say’ to display
social distinction. This, together with an inclination towards cooperation,
explains why participants try to repair misalignments. However, in
multicultural settings interlocutors often ignore the historical processes,
cultural meanings and value systems associated to social practices, that is,
the larger context without which a convergent interpretation of facts and
events is impossible. Thus, while our exchange students were not aware of the
controversial nature of bullfighting and its politicization in Spain today, the
locals ignored the symbolic value associated with luxury shopping in European
capitals among Chinese citizens, and difficulties emerged. Once the participants
negotiated meaning and overcame their lack of shared background knowledge,
their stances could come together. Since emplacement allows the
neutralization of face-threatening acts and helps repair misalignments,
stressing the embodied and situated nature of communication is paramount
for a successful understanding of stancetaking.
Thirdly, ideologies play a much more critical role in stance negotiation than
often acknowledged in the literature. Misalignments have allowed us to
capture the contradictions, and coincidences, that the enactment of a
cosmopolitan orientation raises between locals and newcomers. The stances
taken in the construction of the stance object show the powerful role of
ideologies in interactional clashes, and how overcoming such clashes is often a
matter of ideology too. Repeated enactments of stance embody positions that
sediment into ideological stands. Integrating ideology into the study of
stancetaking is therefore theoretically relevant, as it helps explain the role of
underlying sociocultural processes in stance negotiation. It also sheds light
onto processes that shape contemporary communicative practices, such as the
commodification of cultural and linguistic skills or the need for a cosmopolitan
habitus in order to succeed in university exchange programs.
Fourthly, and consequently, in joining detailed analyses of local discursive
practices with ideological issues and current social processes, our study goes
beyond the here and now of interactional analysis. Also relevant at a
theoretical level is the pertinence of approaching ideology from a micro rather
than a macro standpoint, since there is an often-disregarded link between
micro situated practices and social/ideological aspects and processes. To our
mind, focusing on the local and situated construction of social processes and
on the reproduction of ideologies allows novel insights into the ways in which
globalization is modifying access to symbolic capitals, and also into promising
routes for sociolinguistic enquiry.
