Reward anticipation (‘wanting’) is crucial for human adaptation to
the environment (Bubic, von Cramon, & Schubotz, 2010).  The ability to
predict future motivational events permits us to organize our behavior
proactively to cope with the impact of those events.  For instance, gain
anticipation can promote approach behavior whereas loss anticipation
can promote avoidance behavior (Knutson & Greer, 2008).  On the other
hand, dysfunction in reward anticipation has been identiﬁed as a critical contributor to psychopathologies such as schizophrenia (Gard,
Kring, Gard, Horan, & Green, 2007), depression (Treadway & Zald,
2011), and addictive behaviors (Robinson & Berridge, 2008). taskincentive
A well-validated task designed to evaluate reward anticipation is the
monetary
(Knutson, Westdorp,
Kaiser, & Hommer, 2000), which has been extensively used across
healthy and clinical populations in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; Lutz & Widmer, 2014).  In a typical MID
task trial, participants initially observe a cue signaling trial information
(i. e. , gain, loss, or neutral), followed by a delayed period during which
the participants prepare a motor response for an imperative visual
target.  Following the motor response, another interval is provided
striatum, anterior
during which the participants wait for the outcome of their performance on that trial.  In healthy individuals, reward anticipation mainly
implicates the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic pathway,
includinginsula, and anterior cingulate cortex
(Knutson & Greer, 2008).  However, despite its excellent spatial resolution, fMRI cannot provide the necessary temporal resolution to fully
characterize the temporal dynamics of reward anticipation in the
human brain.  Speciﬁcally, it remains largely unexplored whether those
sub-stages (e. g. , cue evaluation, motor preparation, and feedback anticipation) coarsely labelled reward anticipation are dissociable on the
neural level. 
Electroencephalography (EEG) with its superior temporal resolution
provides a narration of distinct psychological processes as they unfold
during reward anticipation millisecond-by-millisecond.  Three anticipatory slow waves are associated with reward anticipation.  The ﬁrst
slow negative-going wave, labelled the contingent negative variation
(CNV), is typically observed between a warning stimulus (cue) and an
imperative stimulus (target) and is maximal at central sites (Walter,
Cooper, Aldridge, McCallum, & Winter, 1964).  The CNV is believed to
reﬂect neural activity within the thalamo-cortico-striatal network and
has been linked with anticipatory attention, motivation, as well as

motor preparation (Brunia, van Boxtel, & Böcker, 2012; Fan Name,
2007).  Analogous to the CNV, a broad slow negative-going wave during
the waiting period of a motivationally relevant stimulus (e. g. , the
period between the target and feedback in the MID task), called the
stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN), is manifest as a plateau-shaped
distribution at
frontal areas with a right hemisphere dominance
(Brunia, Hackley, van Boxtel, Kotani, & Ohgami, 2011).  The most likely
neural generator of the SPN, given its frontotemporal focus, is the right
anterior insula (Bocker, Brunia, & van den Berg-Lenssen, 1994; Brunia,
de Jong, van den Berg-Lenssen, & Paans, 2000).  In contrast to the CNV,
the SPN reﬂects anticipatory processing more purely due to the exclusion of motor preparation in the waiting period (van Boxtel & Böcker,
2004).  Finally, incentive cues during the cue-evaluation stage often
elicit a P3 component (i. e. , the cue-P3), a positive-going wave peaking
between 300 and 600 ms at parietal sites (Broyd Name, 2012; Goldstein
Name, 2006).  The cue-P3 is generally associated with attentional resources for stimulus evaluation based on motivational signiﬁcance
(Nieuwenhuis, Aston-Jones, & Cohen, 2005). 
Previous research has thus identiﬁed three ERP correlates of reward
anticipation: the cue-P3 during the cue-evaluation stage, the CNV
during the motor-preparation stage, and the SPN during the feedbackanticipation stage.  However, it remains to be determined whether these
anticipatory ERP components reﬂect a common neural process or a set
of distinct neural processes.  Supporting the former hypothesis, all these
ERP components have a close association with the mesocorticolimbic
dopaminergic pathway.
