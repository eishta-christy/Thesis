phylum-level

to recover and characterize genomes and functional
potential from microbes in the oral gingival sulcus of
two bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus).  We detected organisms from 24 known bacterial phyla and
one archaeal phylum.  We also recovered genomes
from two deep-branching, previously uncharacterized phylum-level lineages (here named ‘‘Candidatus
Delphibacteria’’ and ‘‘Candidatus Fertabacteria’’). 
The Delphibacteria lineage is found in both managed
and wild dolphins; its metabolic proﬁle suggests
a capacity for denitriﬁcation and a possible role in
dolphin health.  We uncovered a rich diversity of predicted Cas9 proteins, including the two longest predicted Cas9 proteins to date.  Notably, we identiﬁed
the ﬁrst type II CRISPR-Cas systems encoded by
members of the Candidate Phyla Radiation.  Using
their spacer sequences, we subsequently identiﬁed
and assembled a complete Saccharibacteria phage
genome.  These ﬁndings underscore the immense
microbial diversity and functional potential that await
discovery in previously unexplored environments. 
INTRODUCTION
The vast majority of bacterial diversity is found within phylumlevel
lineages that lack isolated representatives [1], commonly
referred to as ‘‘candidate phyla. ’’ Candidate phyla constitute at
least 103 out of approximately 142 widely recognized bacterial
phyla for which there is genomic representation [1–3]; 46% of
known bacterial phyla are clustered in the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR).  However, there remain many phylum-level bacterial
lineages that have no genomic representation and are not yet
formally recognized [4].  Genome-resolved metagenomic studies
offer unique and unprecedented insights into the biology of these
uncultured, poorly understood lineages and their biochemical
diversity [3–8].  In addition to revealing the environmentally and
economically important roles played by such bacteria, these
studies contribute greatly to our understanding of the distribution
of lifestyles across the tree of life.  For example, genomes from
members of the CPR suggest that they are metabolically sparse
and lack many biosynthetic pathways typically required for life,
presumably because these organisms are dependent on other
microbes for survival
[6, 9].  Candidate phyla genomes may
also reveal novel functional diversity, as phylogenetic diversity
is correlated with novel proteomic diversity and biological properties [10, 11]. 
Marine mammals are an ecologically important group of
animals harboring little-explored microbial communities.  Previous research has shown that bottlenose dolphins, in particular,
host a rich diversity of novel bacteria [12].  Nearly 70% of nearfull-length 16S rRNA genes from the dolphin microbiota were
novel in 2015 at the species level, and representatives from 25
bacterial phyla were present in the mouth alone.  Furthermore,
a surprising number of candidate phyla such as Gracilibacteria
(BD1-5/GN02), Modulibacteria (KSB3), and the Parcubacteria
(OD1) supergroup, which are unusual in mammal-associated environments, were found in the dolphin mouth [12].  Genomes from
such candidate phyla have nearly exclusively been retrieved
from non-host-associated environments, and thus it is unknown
how these bacteria adapt to a mammalian environment.  Interestingly, despite evidence that the marine mammal microbiota is
shaped by the sea, these bacteria were not detected in the adjacent seawater [12]. 
The vast majority of bacterial diversity is found within phylumlevel lineages that lack isolated representatives [1], commonly
referred to as ‘‘candidate phyla. ’’ Candidate phyla constitute at

On the basis of these prior observations, we concluded that
marine mammals afford an unusual opportunity for studying
bacterial diversity.  Working under the hypothesis that novel
phylogenetic diversity correlates with novel functional diversity,

in this study we applied genome-resolved metagenomics to
investigate the diversity and functional potential of the dolphin
oral microbiome.  The results hint at the wealth of evolutionary
and biochemical diversity that remains uncharted within previously unexplored environments, including mammalian microbiomes, and will contribute to future comparative studies of
host-associated versus non-host-associated candidate phyla
bacteria. 
<Middle> RESULTS. 
Dolphin Oral Microbiota Composition and Structure
Swab samples were collected from the gingival sulcus of
healthy bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under the purview of the U. S.  Navy’s Marine Mammal Program in San Diego
Bay, California.  Samples from two dolphins were selected for
shotgun sequencing based on the ﬁndings of Bik Name [12],
which indicated that
these two samples (DolJOral78 and
DolZOral124) contained representatives from nine candidate
phyla at relative abundances of R0. 05% (Table S1).  Pairedend Illumina HiSeq reads were generated, ﬁltered, assembled,
and used to recover microbial genomes, as described in STAR
Methods. 
From >63 Gbp of ﬁltered paired-end sequences, we recovered
107 draft-quality genomes from 24 previously described
bacterial phyla and one circular genome from a candidate Saccharibacteria (TM7) phage (presented below).  These genomes
derived from 22 organisms afﬁliated with the candidate phyla
Absconditabacteria (SR1), Campbellbacteria (OD1), Cloacimonetes (WWE1), Delongbacteria, Fermentibacteria (Hyd24-12),
Gracilibacteria (BD1-5/GN02), Modulibacteria (KSB3), and Moranbacteria (OD1), and the Saccharibacteria (TM7) phylum. 
Phylum-level assignments (or lack thereof, as was the case for
three of our genomes) were determined by constructing a phylogeny based on an alignment of 15 concatenated ribosomal
proteins (Figure 1; Data S1; see STAR Methods).  Of note, we
were able to link a 16S rRNA gene sequence to a member of
the Delongbacteria phylum, which previously consisted of a single genome for which no 16S rRNA gene had been recovered [2]. 
Additionally, low-coverage (%33) archaeal genome fragments
were recovered from two members of the Woesearcheota
phylum.  Similar sequences have been recovered from hostassociated environments (see SILVA database [13–15]), such
as coral heads [16] and human skin [17], but were not originally
recognized as afﬁliated with the Woesearcheota phylum or
placed within a comprehensive phylogeny. 
Bacterial community composition and structure inferred
from the same DNA preparations differed depending on the
survey method: genome-resolved metagenomics (this study)
versus 16S rRNA gene ampliﬁcation [12] (Figure 2; Figure S1;
Table S1).  Notably, the 16S rRNA gene that was associated
with the highest-coverage genome in both samples (17% and
4% relative abundance in DolJOral78 and DolZOral124, respectively; Figure 2) was barely detected in the amplicon-based survey (not detected in DolJOral78; 0. 04% relative abundance in
DolZOral124).  This is surprising, because the PCR primers
match the assembled sequence perfectly, the GC content of
the gene is 58%, and it contains no unusual
insertions.  The
two genomes are from the same species of Actinobacteria (order
Micrococcales), and the GC content of the genome is 68%. 
Furthermore, members of the CPR were greatly under-detected
using the amplicon-based approach.  From the metagenomic assemblies, we detected 16 unique CPR species-level genomes,
some of which ranked among the highest-coverage genomes
recovered (Figure 2).  For example, the fourth most abundant
bacterial organism in the DolJOral78 sample was a member of
the Saccharibacteria phylum (4% relative abundance), although
no Saccharibacteria representatives were detected in the
DolJOral78 sample in the previous 16S rRNA gene amplicon survey.  In the amplicon-based study [12], only nine unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the CPR were identiﬁed
from both samples combined, with a maximum relative abundance of 0. 24%.  This discrepancy can be explained at least
partially by primer mismatches, consistent with previous reports
on the CPR [4].  Of the 21 unique CPR 16S rRNA genes assembled and identiﬁed in the metagenomic data, nine span the region between the commonly used 338F and 906R bacterial
primers (also used in Bik Name [12]) and have sufﬁcient read
coverage to validate the assembly.  Eight of these have 1–3 mismatches in at least one primer site.  In the amplicon study, eight
of the nine OTUs were detected among all samples, although
only the one OTU with no primer site mismatches was detected
in the two samples studied here. 
Given the breadth of novel bacterial diversity in the dolphin
oral samples, we next searched for novel phage diversity. 
Using a stringent set of criteria (see STAR Methods), we identiﬁed a set of 33 and 55 sequences from DolJOral78 and
DolZOral124, respectively, for which we had high conﬁdence
in their derivation from phage genomes.  These sequences
range in length from 1,583 to 119,885 bp (average 19,363
and 21,462; SD 13,243 and 19,615 bp).  To assess overlap
between samples, we performed a reciprocal best-hit BLAST
[18, 19] search between phage sequences from the two
samples.  We identiﬁed 14 phage genome fragments that
were present (or had close relatives present) in both samples. 
To evaluate the degree of phage genome novelty, we BLASTed
[18, 19] phage sequences against the NCBI non-redundant
nucleotide
(https://ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/nucleotide). 
Only three alignments were longer than 1,000 bp, the longest
of which was only 2,919 bp.  These alignments corresponded
to 2. 3%, 3. 8%, and 8. 2% of the lengths of the respective
phage scaffolds.  This suggests that phages in the dolphin
mouth are only distantly related to phages for which genomic
fragments have previously been recovered, as one would
expect under the hypothesis that novel bacterial diversity begets novel phage diversity.

Novel, Deeply Divergent Phylum-Level Lineages
The concatenated ribosomal protein tree enabled determination
of the phylum-level identity of recovered genomes (Figure 1). 
Within this tree, three genomes belonging to two deep-branching lineages eluded identiﬁcation.  To evaluate whether these
two lineages were representative of previously undescribed
phyla, we examined whether (1) they formed monophyletic lineages in both the concatenated ribosomal protein phylogeny and
the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, and (2) the 16S rRNA gene sequences of such lineages were at least 25% divergent from
those of known phyla (i. e. , the threshold used by Yarza Name [20]).

Figure 1.  Phylogenetic Relationships among Genomes Recovered from the Dolphin Mouth
The maximum-likelihood tree includes representation from all genomes that contained R8 of 15 ribosomal proteins used to infer the phylogeny (with the
exception of one Delongbacteria genome with 7 ribosomal proteins) as well as from published genomes.  Bootstrap support values R50% are denoted with a
closed circle on the branches.  Branches of phyla with genomic representation in the dolphin mouth are color coded such that dark blue indicates candidate
phylum, light blue indicates other phylum, and red indicates novel, deep-branching lineage.  Labels for these phyla appear around the tree, with dotted lines
indicating the corresponding branch.  Numbers next to candidate phyla names indicate the number of genomes from each phylum that are publicly available in
NCBI databases prior to this study (purple), the number of those that come from an animal-associated environment (green), and the number that were recovered
in this study (orange).  Branches of the remaining phyla are included in the tree as references, are colored black, and can be identiﬁed using the legend at the
bottom of the ﬁgure.
