Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly, characterized by a decline in
cognitive functions.  Sporadic AD (sAD; i. e. , late-onset AD), the most
frequent form of AD with an unknown etiology, presents early abnormalities in brain glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, thus
resulting in an insulin-resistant state in the brain, which has been
suggested to be related to etiological events in its pathogenesis [1,2]. 
Additionally, protein aggregates [3], mitochondrial dysfunctions [4],
oxidative stress [5], neuroinﬂammation [6], brain cholinergic deﬁcits
[7], and dysfunctions in adult neurogenesis [8–10] are among the main
features of
sAD.  These features may be modeled by a intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of low, subdiabetogenic doses of
streptozotocin (STZ) in rodents [11,12] and non-human primates [13]. 
Adult neurogenesis is a multi-step process of the formation of new
neurons in the mammalian brain throughout life.  Evidence suggests
that newly generated neurons play a crucial role in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory (e. g. , spatial memory and orientation)
and recovery from neuronal injury [14].  Neurogenesis starts from the
proliferation of resident neural stem cells (NSC) and neural progenitor
cells (NPC) in two neurogenic niches in the central nervous system
(CNS): the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles (LVs), and
the subgranular zone (SGZ) ofthe dentate gyrus (DG) of

hippocampus.  The process of adult neurogenesis can be inﬂuenced by
many intrinsic and extrinsic factors.  Growth factors and neurotrophins,
such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
increase diﬀerentiation, maturation, and survival of proliferating NSC/NPC, stimulating neurogenesis.  In contrast, microglial activation and release of
proinﬂammatory cytokines (e. g. , interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) have been demonstrated to inhibit neurogenesis by reducing the proliferation of NSC/NPC.  The consequence of
inhibiting neurogenesis is cognitive deﬁcit, reﬂected by impairments in
spatial and recognition learning and memory [15].  Several studies have
reported an increase in neuroinﬂammation in the STZ model of sAD,
reﬂected by reactive gliosis and an increase in proinﬂammatory markers that are associated with cognitive decline [16–19].  Other studies
reported a decrease in neurogenesis associated with oxidative stress
[20] or amyloid pathology [21]. 
Current therapeutic options for AD are limited because most agents
provide only symptomatic relief from cognitive deﬁcits.  A neuroprotective agent able to improve cognitive function along with slowing
neuronal loss, decrease neuroinﬂammation and improve neurogenesis
is needed.  Curcuma longa (turmeric) is a rhizomatous native plant from
South and Southeast Asia which belongsZingiberaceae [22].  Traditionally curcumin, the main active ingredient
in turmeric, has been used as a common food additive and herbal
medicine [23].  Epidemiological studies have suggested that societies
that widely use curcumin have a reduced incidence of AD and improved
cognitive function [24,25].

The natural polyphenol curcumin possesses pleiotropic properties.  It
has been reported to provide neuroprotection in cellular and animal
models of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders including
AD, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, depression, and schizophrenia [26].  Neuroprotection provided by curcumin may be due to its antioxidant properties, by upregulation of the
transcription factor Nrf2 [27], and anti-inﬂammatory properties, by
suppression of NF-κB activation [28].  Curcumin also inhibits amyloid
beta (Aβ)-oligomerization and tau-phosphorylation [29] and increases
BDNF levels in corticosterone-treated rats [30], chronically stressed rats
[31] and Wistar Kyoto rats [23]. 
In addition, curcumin potentiates spatial and non-spatial memory in
aged mice [32] and rats [33], in Aβ-induced [34] and STZ-induced
models of AD [35–38].  The positive eﬀects of curcumin on cognition
may be related to its capacity to enhance neurogenesis.  Curcumin has
shown to increase neurite outgrowth and proliferation of NSC both in
vitro and in vivo through the activation of the ERK and MAP kinase
pathways [39,40].  Curcumin treatment
increases neurogenesis in
chronically stressed rats [41], aged rats [33] and in Aβ-induced model
of AD [26].  Nevertheless, the eﬀects of prolonged curcumin treatment
on adult neurogenesis were not studied in the STZ-ICV model of sAD. 
Therefore, we hypothesized that curcumin treatment would be able to
preserve cognitive functions of STZ-ICV injected rats by increasing
adult neurogenesis and decreasing neuroinﬂammation.

2. 1.  Animals
In this study, 3–4 months old male Wistar rats weighing 300–340 g
at the beginning of the experiment were used.  All animals were obtained from our breeding colony.  The animals had free access to food
and water, were maintained in a temperature-controlled room
(22 °C ± 2 °C) on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 AM),
and were randomly housed in groups of 3–4 in polypropylene cages
with wood shavings as bedding.  The studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal University of Paraná and
were approved by the University Ethics Committee (protocol no.  735).

prolonged curcumin treatment in three diﬀerent doses (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) on shortterm spatial and recognition memory, neuroinﬂammation and adult neurogenesis in rats
that received a single bilateral ICV injection of STZ.  IHC, immunohistochemistry; OFT,

2. 2.  Drugs
Streptozotocin (N-[methylnitrosocarbamoyl]-α-D-glucosamine) was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and
curcumin (from Curcuma longa) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. 
Louis, MO, USA). 
2. 3.  Experimental design
The rats were randomly divided into ﬁve groups: sham (n = 7), STZ
(n = 7), STZ + curcumin 25 mg/kg (STZ + cur 25; n = 6), STZ
+ curcumin 50 mg/kg (STZ + cur 50; n = 8), and STZ + curcumin
100 mg/kg (STZ + cur 100; n = 7).  The STZ groups received a single
bilateral ICV injection of STZ (3 mg/kg total dose) dissolved in sterile
0. 9% saline (4. 5 μl per injection site).  The sham group received a single
bilateral ICV injection of sterile 0. 9% saline (4. 5 μl per injection site;
Fig.  1).  Treatment with curcumin (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, per os) or its
vehicle (0. 5% carboxymethylcelulose in distilled water with 1% Tween
80) was performed over 30 days, once a day in the afternoon, and
started 1 h before the beginning of stereotaxic surgeries. 
The animals were allowed to recover for 3 weeks following surgery
before behavioral evaluations.  These animals were assessed in the open
ﬁeld test (OFT) to evaluate spontaneous locomotor activity on day 21
after surgery and in the elevated plus maze (EPM) on day 22 to assess
anxiety-like behavior.  Cognitive performance was evaluated in the
object location test (OLT) on day 28, in the object recognition test
(ORT) on day 29, and in the spatial version of the Y maze on day 30. 
Right after the last behavioral analysis, blood glucose levels were
measured using a G-Tech Free device using blood samples that were
collected by tail prick. 
i. p. ) and intracardially perfused for posterior
Afterward, animals were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate
(400 mg/kg,
immunohistochemical evaluation of Doublecortin (DCX; a marker of
newborn and migrating neurons), Ki-67 (a marker of cell proliferation),
ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule (Iba-1; a marker of microglia), and glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP; a marker of astrocytes).
