Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly, characterized by a decline in
cognitive functions.  Sporadic AD (sAD; i. e. , late-onset AD), the most
frequent form of AD with an unknown etiology, presents early abnormalities in brain glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, thus
resulting in an insulin-resistant state in the brain, which has been
suggested to be related to etiological events in its pathogenesis [1,2]. 
Additionally, protein aggregates [3], mitochondrial dysfunctions [4],
oxidative stress [5], neuroinﬂammation [6], brain cholinergic deﬁcits
[7], and dysfunctions in adult neurogenesis [8–10] are among the main
features of
sAD.  These features may be modeled by a intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of low, subdiabetogenic doses of
streptozotocin (STZ) in rodents [11,12] and non-human primates [13]. 
Adult neurogenesis is a multi-step process of the formation of new
neurons in the mammalian brain throughout life.  Evidence suggests
that newly generated neurons play a crucial role in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory (e. g. , spatial memory and orientation)
and recovery from neuronal injury [14].  Neurogenesis starts from the
proliferation of resident neural stem cells (NSC) and neural progenitor
cells (NPC) in two neurogenic niches in the central nervous system
(CNS): the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles (LVs), and
the subgranular zone (SGZ) ofthe dentate gyrus (DG) of
