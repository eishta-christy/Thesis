Novel Microbial Diversity and Functional Potential in
the Marine Mammal Oral MicrobiomeHighlights
d Genomes were recovered from dolphin-associated
candidate phyla bacteria
d Two new bacterial phyla were deﬁned (C.  Delphibacteria and
C.  Fertabacteria)
d C.  Delphibacteria is common in the dolphin mouth and may
affect host physiology
d Novel functional diversity was identiﬁed, including unusual
CRISPR-Cas9 systemsNatasha K.  Dudek, Christine L.  Sun,

In Brief
Dudek Name reconstruct genomes from
previously uncharacterized microbes
living in the dolphin mouth.  Three of these
genomes represent two new phyla, and
22 come from members of nine relatively
unexplored candidate phyla.
