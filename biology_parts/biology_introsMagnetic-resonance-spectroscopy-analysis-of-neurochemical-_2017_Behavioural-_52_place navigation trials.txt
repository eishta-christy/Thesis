Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder accompanied by cognitive decline [1].  The World
Alzheimer Report 2015 estimates that over 46 million people live with
dementia worldwide and the cost of dementia is $818 billion [2]. 
Furthermore, the prevalence of AD increases with ageing and doubles
every ﬁve years after the age of 65, which will cause great economic
and social burdens [2,3]. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
including structural MRI,
functional MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS),
is becoming more useful in the understanding of the pathogenesis and
diagnosis of AD [4–12].  Brain morphological abnormalities, such as
hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala have been gradually
uncovered with the development of structural MRI in the study of AD
patients [4,8,9].  Animal structural MRI also shows striatum and entorhinal cortex atrophy in AD models, including the TASTPM and APP/
PS2/Tau mouse [13].  In addition, 1H MRS studies have suggested that
neurochemical alterations, such as those associated with glutamate
(Glu) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the hippocampus or cingulate,
contribute to cognitive decline in AD patients [14–16].  In animal
models of AD, neurochemical alterations were measured similarly with
that of AD patients [17–19].  Glu is a primary excitatory neurotransmitter that is thought to represent the number of survival neurons
[20].  NAA is a speciﬁc kind of amino acids that mainly exists in the
neurons and axon [21].  As a neuronal marker, the concentration of

NAA can be sensitive to neuron density.  myo-inositol (mIn) is one of the
most abundant metabolites visible on 1H MRS in the brain and can act
as a biomarker of glial activation[22].  A number of studies suggest that
neurochemical alterations are associated with cognitive decline in AD
[18,21,23–25]. 
However, few studies have contemporarily focused on the roles of
structural MRI changes and neurochemical alterations in cognitive decline associated with AD.  Therefore, the current study aimed to measure the learning and memory ability and regional volumes in APP/PS1
transgenic mice.  Furthermore, some atrophic regions were selected as
region of interest (ROI) to explore neurochemical metabolism using 1H
MRS in order to further understand cognitive decline in AD.

2. 1.  Animals
Twelve-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice and age-matched littermate wild-type (C57Bl/6J) control mice were used for the water
maze, MRI and 1H MRS analyses, with 2 diﬀerent groups per test (n = 7
mice/group, weights 25–35 g).  APP/PS1 mice express a chimeric
mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a
mutanthuman presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9), which are associated with earlyonset AD [26]. 
All animals were kept in standard size mouse cages (29*18*13 cm,
up to 5 per same sex group) at 20–26 °C on a daily 12-h light-dark cycle
with ad libitum access to food and water.  All experiments were performed strictly in accordance with the International Ethical Guidelines
and National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Ethics Committee of
Fujian University of TCM, P. R.  China (protocol #FUTCM-2014012).  All
eﬀorts were made to minimize animal suﬀering. 
2. 2.  Morris water maze test
Cognitive function was tested using a water maze apparatus
(Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China), which was a stainless
steel circular tank with a diameter of 120 cm and a height of 50 cm.  The
tank was ﬁlled with water (21–23 °C) to a depth of 40 cm and divided
into four equal quadrants.  A platform (diameter, 6 cm) was placed in
the third quadrant and submerged 1 cm below the surface of the water. 
For the place navigation trials, mice were trained for ﬁve days.  Each
trial was started by placing the mice in one of the four quadrants.
