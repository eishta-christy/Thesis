According to the current thinking, schizophrenia is the result of a
functional dysconnection between various integrative cerebral regions
[1,2] which, for a number of cases at least, has a neurodevelopmental
origin [3,4].  One of these regions, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), appears
to be especially aﬀected [5], as suggested by cytoarchitectural, morphological and functional anomalies described in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in the left hemisphere [6–8].  These anomalies
could be due to perinatal changes occurring during cerebral development, in particular in cellular migration, with changes expressed in the
form of defective connectivity which leads to the characteristic psychic
dissociation observed in schizophrenia. 
Concerning the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the existence of a
transmission is
striatal dopaminergic (DAergic)
dysregulation of
generally acknowledged [9] and is supported by a number of studies of
brain imaging performed over the past 20 years which highlighted an
enhanced basal level of striatal dopamine (DA) as well as an increase in
its release in non-treated patients with schizophrenia compared to
healthy subjects [10].  These data that suggest an increase in DAergic
transmission are in keeping with the common property of typical and
atypical antipsychotics, which is to block type D2 DAergic receptors. 
However, the increase in basal DA transmission may not be uniformly
distributed in the striatum, and some authors have suggested diﬀerences between sub-regions of the striatum, namely an increase in the
anterior dorsal striatum, but not in the ventral striatum [11,12].  The
striatum is the principal region of projection of mesencephalic DAergic
neurons and comprises two regions, the dorsal striatum and the ventral
striatum.  The main component of the ventral striatum is the nucleus
accumbens (Nacc), usually subdivided into two subsections which can

be diﬀerentiated from an anatomo-functional point of view.  These two
subsections are an external part, the shell sub-region, which surrounds a
central part, the core sub-region, located near the anterior commissureIn neuroimaging studies [11,12], no subdivision was made between
the core and shell sub-regions of the ventral striatum.  As regards differentiation between the core and shell parts of the Nacc in humans,
post-mortem anatomical studies suggest that the DA synthesis, as assessed in terms of the density of tyrosine hydroxylase labelling, is similar for the two sub-regions of the Nacc in control subjects and patients with schizophrenia [14].  However, in contrast to that, recent
human post-mortem ultrastructural
investigations revealed an enhancement in the density of asymmetric synapses, typical of excitatory
aﬀerents, in the core part of the Nacc but not in the shell of patients with
schizophrenia, compared to controls [15].  A reduction in the postsynaptic density (PSD) area of asymmetric synapses was also observed
in both core and shell parts of the Nacc, but more markedly so in the core
sub-region of patients [15].  Whatever the exact meaning of the ultrastructural data, they may suggest that control of DA release by excitatory inputs may be aﬀected diﬀerently in the two parts of the Nacc
in patients with schizophrenia (and preferentially in the core part). 
As regards the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, a dysfunction of
glutamatergic transmission involving N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors has also been suggested [16].  Based on the results of several
studies carried out in humans it has been established that at sub-anesthetic doses, administration of non-competitive antagonists of NMDA
receptors induced symptoms comparable to those observed in schizophrenia in healthy subjects [17,18] and aggravated such symptoms in
patients with schizophrenia [19,20].  These observations led several
authors [16,21] to propose that the dysregulation of the striatal
DAergic transmission in schizophrenia could result from defective
prefrontal-striatal connectivity involving NMDA receptors. 
Improving our knowledge of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia
is vital for the development of new treatments.  The nature of the disease is such, however, that it is not easy to conduct clinical investigations with non-treated patients, which is why animal modeling of the
pathophysiology of schizophrenia is so important [22].  The aforementioned data suggest several hypotheses should be taken into account
with a view to achieving the best possible animal modeling of the
disease.  In particular, it is important to bear in mind that rather than
being evenly dysregulated, striatal DAergic transmission in schizophrenia may be dysregulated diﬀerently in the striatal sub-regions.  In
this context, and also taking into account the hypothesis of a neurodevelopmental impairment of the left PFC as well as that of defective
prefrontal-striatal connectivity involving NMDA receptors in schizophrenia, we previously investigated DAergic responses to challenge
with NMDA antagonists in the anterior dorsal striatum [23] and in the
dorsomedial shell part of the Nacc [24] in adult rats microinjected with
tetrodotoxin (TTX) at postnatal day 8 (PND8).  The results showed that
in adult animals neonatally inactivated with TTX, compared to respective PBS control animals, treatment with the NMDA antagonist
ketamine induced a greater increase in DA release in the anterior dorsal
striatum [23].  As regards the dorsomedian shell, at adulthood the
NMDA antagonists ketamine and MK 801 induced a decrease in DA
release below basal levels in PBS controls, whereas administration of
the two NMDA antagonists induced a reversal of the DA reduction
observed in PBS controls followed by an increase in DA levels in animals neonatally microinjected with TTX in the PFC [24].  In this connection, with respect to neurodevelopmental animal modeling for
schizophrenia, to the best of our knowledge there are no other data in
the literature regarding the impact of neonatal manipulation (blockade
or lesioning) of the PFC on NMDA receptor-dependent DA release in the
dorsal striatum or in the Nacc, particularly in the core sub-region.  It is
interesting to note, however, that after PFC neonatal ibotenic acid lesions an altered responsiveness to DAergic drugs (apomorphine, haloperidol) was observed in the core part of the Nacc, possibly linked to the
loss of PFC eﬀerent pathways in respect of glutamatergic regulation in
neonatally lesioned animals [25].  In other respects, in our studies we
also estimated behavioral reactivity to NMDA antagonists by measuring
locomotor activity.  This behavioral index is commonly used in animal
modeling of some aspects of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia,
based on the parallel that can be established between the emergence of
locomotor hyperactivity observed in rats and that of positive symptoms
described in humans after administration of psychostimulants [26,27]. 
In our previous studies [23,24] no obvious relationships were observed
between DAergic changes and locomotor responses. 
The aim of the present work was to study the eﬀects of neonatal
functional TTX inactivation of the left PFC at PND8 on DAergic variations in the core part of the Nacc and on locomotor responses after
subcutaneous administration (s. c. ), to adult rats, of dizocilpine (MK
801), a particularly selective non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors [28,29], presenting a high aﬃnity for these receptors.  As suggested by the human post-mortem ultrastructural investigations discussed above [15], the core part of the Nacc, in particular, would appear
to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and therefore
deserves speciﬁc investigation in the context of animal modeling.  Furthermore, the core is of particular interest insofar as this sub-region of
the Nacc seems to be involved in the expression of locomotor responses
and behavioral responses adapted to the context [13], particularly in
latent inhibition paradigms carried out in studies concerning animal
modeling of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia [see Meyer and
Louilot,30].

2. 1.  Animals and experimental designAnimal
Experimentation
All the experimental procedures were carried out according to
Directive 2010/63/EU revising Directive 86/609/EEC of the European
Union relative to the protection of animals used for experimental and
other scientiﬁc purposes and were authorized by the French Ministry of
Agriculture (authorization 67-244) and the Strasbourg Regional Ethics
Committee
(CREMEAS-CEEA35)
(License:AL/42/49/02/13).  The experimental protocol is similar to that
reported in previous papers [23,24,31].  In short, the Sprague-Dawley
rats used in the present study were maintained at 22 ± 2 °C and given
ad libitum access to food and water.  Rat pups were issued from gestant
mothers (Janvier-Labs, Le Genest St-Isle, France) subjected to a 12 h/
12 h light-dark cycle (lights on from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm) and housed
individually during pregnancy.  At postnatal day 8 (PND8), pups were
microinjected in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) with either TTX or PBS (the
solvent).  At postnatal day 56 (PND56), male animals were placed under
a reversed lighting cycle (lights oﬀ from 11:00 am to 11:00 pm).  At
postnatal day 70 (PND70), male rats were implanted with a specially
designed microsystem [32] allowing DA to be monitored in the core
part of the Nacc, in parallel to behavior, in freely moving animals.  After
recovering from the surgery (at least 7 days) the animals were subjected
to the pharmacological challenge during the dark phase of the cycle
[For further details see 23,24]. 
2. 2.  Neonate surgery: functional inactivation of the PFC
TTX functional inactivation of the left PFC was performed in rat
pups at PND8.  Neonates were subjected to isoﬂurane anaesthesia
(Isovet®, CSP, Cournon-d’Auvergne, France).  Control animals and experimental animals were then given the PFC microinjection of PBS and
TTX respectively, on a random basis.  For each solution a volume of
0. 3 μl was infused over 2 min 15 s with the following coordinates:
1. 5 mm anterior to bregma (AP), 0. 4 mm lateral to the midline (L) and
3. 9 mm below the cortical surface (H).  The procedure has already been
published in detail [23,24,31].  As discussed in our previous studies, the
eﬃcient spread for the volume of TTX microinjected in the PFC isE.  Tagliabue Name

unlikely to have a radius greater than 0. 67 mm, and TTX functional
inactivation lasts between 4 h and two days [33,34]. 
2. 3.  Adult surgery: stereotaxic implantation of the microsystem
So that is was possible to follow the behavior and DAergic changes
in freely moving animals simultaneously, a specially designed microsystem, Unimécanique [32] was surgically implanted at PND70 to allow
carbon ﬁber electrodes to be inserted extemporaneously in the left core
part of the Nacc.  To that end, adult male rats, microinjected with TTX
or PBS in the left PFC at PND8 and weighing about 400 ± 25 g at the
time of surgery, were ﬁrst anaesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/
kg; 8 ml/kg ip) [35]; placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Unimécanique,
Epinay/Seine, France) and then to ensure an analgesia as complete as
possible an additional s.
