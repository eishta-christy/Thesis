Public health messages delivered in video format are the mainstay
of smoking-cessation campaigns that have contributed to the decline in
smoking prevalence in the US (Woloshin, Schwartz, & Welch, 2008). 
Yet, despite these eﬀorts, smoking remains a leading cause of mortality
and morbidity worldwide, and is responsible for more than 480,000
deaths annually in the United States alone (U. S.  Department of Health
and Human Services, 2014).  Therefore, it is imperative to identify the
factors that inﬂuence audiences’ cognitive processing of smoking-cessation videos (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). 
Sensory features, which attract viewer’s attention through engaging visuals, edits, and music, have been hypothesized to be one such factor
(D’Silva and Palmgreen, 2007; Helme, Donohew, Baier, & Zittleman, 2007;
Morgan, Palmgreen, Stephenson, Hoyle, & Lorch, 2003).  Message sensation
value (MSV) is a validated measure that has been developed to quantify
such sensory features in health promotion videos (Morgan Name, 2003).  The
prevailing assumption that higher MSV improves cognitive processing and
eﬀectiveness of health promotion videos has been challenged by recent
neuroimaging studies, which found that videos with lower MSV were better
remembered and elicited greater prefrontal and temporal
response
(Langleben Name, 2009; Seelig Name, 2014).  These ﬁndings are consistent
with predictions of the limited cognitive capacity theories.  These theories
suggest that although high MSV attracts viewers’ attention, it also diverts
cognitive resources from processing the health information content in the
videos (Petty and Cacioppo, 1986; Wilson and Wolf, 2009). 
While these studies question the value of utilizing high MSV as an
eﬀective communication tool, they do not address the possibility that
individual diﬀerences in attention to sensory stimulation may be responsible for the lack of eﬀectiveness of high-MSV videos at a population level (Everett and Palmgreen, 1995; Stephenson and Palmgreen,
2001).  Such diﬀerences would have been of purely academic interest in
the era of network television, but as media becomes more personalized,
individual diﬀerences in the neurocognitive processing of health promotion videos begin to acquire real life relevance (Chua Name, 2011). 
Yet, experimental data on the biological basis of individual diﬀerences
in the cognitive processing of health messages are very limited.  Many
key traits that may aﬀect individual ability to process health messages,
such as selective attention, working memory and reward sensitivity, are
inﬂuenced by dopaminergic neurotransmission (Gordon, Devaney,
Bean, & , Vaidya, 2015).  The dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) has a
variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism that modulates
dopaminergic neurotransmission, with the 10-repeat (10R) and 9-repeat (9R) alleles as the most common forms (Mitchell Name, 2000).  The

10R/10R homozygosity has been linked to a higher level of novelty
seeking, a trait that indicates greater reactivity to novel external stimulation (Sabol Name, 1999).  The 10R allele has also been consistently
implicated in increased susceptibility to attention deﬁcit disorder
(ADD) (Cook Name, 1995; Gill, Daly, Heron, Hawi, & Fitzgerald, 1997;
Gizer, Ficks, & Waldman, 2009; Kebir, Tabbane, Sengupta, & Joober,
2009; Newman Name, 2014).  Although it remains unclear whether this
association is mediated by the dopamine or dopamine transporter levels
(Yang Name, 2007), it suggests that homozygous 10R allele carriers are
more likely than others to exhibit poor attentional processing, e. g. 
diﬃculty ﬁltering out irrelevant sensory stimuli, which is a key
symptom of ADD (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).  Therefore,
it is possible that when exposed to public health video messages with
high MSV, 10R DAT1 homozygotes would be more engaged by the attention-grabbing sensory features compared to carriers of other genotypes. 
The present study sought to examine the eﬀect of DAT1 polymorphism on the brain response to high MSV format.  The value of such
candidate gene approach is limited by the a priori assumptions about
the relationship between the gene and the phenotype (Tabor,
Risch, & Myers, 2002).  However, it remains useful as the practical approach to generate initial data on the eﬀects of individual genetic
makeup on the neurocognitive processing of public health communication in a small sample (Simon Name, 2011).
