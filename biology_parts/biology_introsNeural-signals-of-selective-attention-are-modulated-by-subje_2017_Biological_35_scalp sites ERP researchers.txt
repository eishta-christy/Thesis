Recent evidence has shown that brain activity measured with the
event-related potentials (ERP) method co-varies with preferences for
consumer goods (Junghöfer Name, 2010; Pozharliev, Verbeke, Van
Strien, & Bagozzi, 2015; Schaefer, Buratto, Goto, & Brotherhood, 2016;
Telpaz, Webb, & Levy, 2015).  This is an important development in an
emerging ﬁeld – consumer neuroscience – that aims to investigate
consumer behaviour (CB) with neuroscience methods.  The results from
two of these studies (Telpaz Name, 2015; Junghofer Name, 2010) suggest
that early brain potentials (neural signals occurring less than 300 ms
after participants ﬁrst see the image of a consumer good) can index
consumer preferences. 
These results can be interpreted from the perspective of the “motivated attention” theoretical
framework (Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert,
1997; Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006), which contends that similar early
ERPs reﬂect automatic attentional processes towards motivationally
relevant stimuli (Olofsson, Nordin, Sequeira, & Polich, 2008; Schupp,
Flaisch Name, 2006; Walker Name, 2011).  However, a striking aspect of
ERP studies of CB is that they do not report consistent links between
consumer preferences and late ERP positivities, which are often

modulated by motivationally relevant stimuli (Olofsson Name, 2008),
and are thought to reﬂect post-perceptive and controlled selective attention processes (Schupp, Stockburger Name, 2006).  In order to investigate this issue, the primary goal of this study was to examine the
ERP correlates of consumer preferences with a particular focus on late
ERP positivities.  In the remainder of this section we brieﬂy review past
work on motivated attention processes and their electrophysiological
correlates.  We then review existing ERP studies of consumer behaviour
and provide an overview of the present study.

Motivated attention is classically separated in two subprocesses: A
quick, “preattentive” mechanism of attentional orientation; and a more1996;

notion that, from a neurobiological perspective, attention is seen as the

processes by aﬀective-motivational factors can occur through two different routes.  First a “quick” route would involve subcortical structures
predominantly involved in the evaluation of motivational relevance
(e. g.  the amygdala; Pessoa & Adolphs, 2010; Schaefer Name, 2006). 
These structures would detect the presence of motivationally relevant
information in the environment through sensory inputs and would
subsequently modulate activity in sensory cortices through relatively
direct pathways (Vuilleumier & Huang, 2009).  This route is classically
thought to be automatic (Vuilleumier, Armony, Driver, & Dolan, 2001),
although evidence suggests that it can be modulated by top-down
controlled processes (Pessoa, McKenna, Gutierrez, & Ungerleider, 2002;
Pessoa, Padmala, & Morland, 2005). 
The second pathway of motivated attention is one in which neocortical networks (mainly frontal and parietal areas) receive inputs
conveying emotional information, and subsequently modulate sensory
cortices.  This mechanism is thought to be linked to overt and controlled
attentional processes (LeDoux, 1996; Vuilleumier & Huang, 2009).  Beyond the main theoretical distinction between a quick “preattentive”
and a slower overt attentional response, a third process is often proposed in which attentional resources would be allocated to motivationally-relevant stimuli in a temporally sustained manner.  This third
subtype of motivated attention would most likely involve working
memory (WM) processes and facilitate a more elaborative processing of
motivationally-relevant
information (Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006;
Watts, Buratto, Brotherhood, Barnacle, & Schaefer, 2014).

ERP researchers have identiﬁed three types of brain potentials to
emotional pictures that map onto the three attentional subprocesses
described above.  As some of us explained in previous articles (Walker
Name, 2011; Watts Name, 2014), ERPs to stimuli of higher motivational
relevance (e.
