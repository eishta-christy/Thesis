Alexithymia is a personality trait involving deﬁcits in emotional processing.  The personality construct has been
extensively validated, but the underlying neural and physiological systems remain controversial.  One theory
suggests that low-level somatosensory mechanisms act as somatic markers of emotion, underpinning cognitive
and aﬀective impairments in alexithymia.  In two separate samples (total N = 100), we used an established
Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) battery to probe multiple neurophysiological submodalities of somatosensation, and investigated their associations with the widely-used Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). 
Experiment one found reduced sensitivity to warmth in people with higher alexithymia scores, compared to
individuals with lower scores, without deﬁcits in other somatosensory submodalities.  Experiment two replicated
this result in a new group of participants using a full-sample correlation between threshold for warm detection
and TAS-20 scores.  We discuss the relations between low-level thermoceptive function and cognitive processing
of emotion. 
Alexithymia is a multifaceted personality construct, expressed with
varying intensity in the general population.  Self-report measures like
the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) (Bagby, Parker, & Taylor, 1994),
the most widely used and well-validated assessment tool (Bagby Name,
1994; Parker, Michael Bagby, Taylor, Endler, & Schmitz, 2003) characterise alexithymia through three main facets: diﬃculties in identifying feelings (DIF), diﬃculties in describing feelings (DDF), and externally-oriented thinking or a preoccupation with the details of
external events (EOT).  Dimensional analysis suggest alexithymia comprises an aﬀective dimension, involving emotionalizing, and fantasizing, and a cognitive dimension, involving identifying, diﬀerentiatingBruce, Martens,
Aleman, & Hooker, 2014; Herbert, Herbert, & Pollatos, 2011; Parker,
Keefer, Taylor, & Bagby, 2008; Taylor, Bagby, & Parker, 1991).  Importantly, people with high levels of alexithymia exhibit diﬃculties not
only in processing their own emotions, but also in processing the
emotions

(Goerlich-Dobre,by(Borhani,Pellegrino, & Làdavas, 2014; Sifneos, 1973).  Thus, alexithymic individuals show altered recognition of emotional stimuli (Grynberg
Name, 2012; Ihme Name, 2014) and decreased activation of the amygdala during presentation of emotional stimuli (Jongen Name, 2014;
Moriguchi & Komaki, 2013), and particularly negative stimuli (Kugel
Name, 2008; Pouga, Berthoz, de Gelder, & Grezes, 2010; Reker Name,
2010; for a recent metaanalysis: van der Velde Name, 2013). 
The relation between alexithymic traits and speciﬁc neural systems
or pathways remains controversial.  The multiple somatosensory pathways that transmit interoceptive, proprioceptive, mechanoreceptive
and nociceptive information to the CNS are a plausible candidate.  The
view of emotions as linked to bodily states, or ‘somatic markers’ has
long been popular (Damasio. , 1999; Damasio, Everitt, & Bishop, 1996;
James, 1890).  Indeed, emotion-speciﬁc responses have been reported in
primary somatosensory cortex (Sel, Forster, & Calvo-Merino, 2014). 
Such theories suggest that alexithymia might involve abnormalities of
somatosensory or autonomic processing.  Disruption in regulation of
emotions in alexithymia, particularly negative emotions, is thought to
result in chronic sympathetic hyperarousal, high sensitivity to painful
stimulation, somatosensory ampliﬁcation (the tendency to experience
mild somatic sensations as intense, noxious, and disturbing – Barsky,

Goodson, Lane, & Cleary, 1988) and complaints of physical symptomsLumley,
Stettner, & Wehmer, 1996).  Brain regions previously associated with
somatosensory processing,
including the insula and somatosensory
cortices (Dijkerman & De Haan, 2007; Iwamura, 1998) were hypothesised to be overactive during emotional processing in alexithymia, potentially explaining the tendency to experience physical symptoms
when emotionally aroused (Karlsson, Näätänen, & Stenman, 2008). 
However other studies failed to ﬁnd associations between somatosensory ampliﬁcation and alexithymia (Gregory, Manring, & Berry, 2000;
Kosturek, Gregory, Sousou, & Trief, 1998; Lesser, Koehle, & Lueders,
1979).  Moreover, the frequent comorbidity of alexithymia with several
psychiatric disorders may contribute to such discrepancies.  For instance, while Nyklı́ček and Vingerhoets (2000) reported hypersensitivity for pain and touch in alexithymia, de Zwaan, Biener, Bach,
Wiesnagrotzki, and Stacher (1996) failed to ﬁnd any association between the degree of alexithymia and thermally and mechanically induced pain thresholds, in a group of eating disorder patients with
alexithymia (de Zwaan Name, 1996).  Table 1. 
This summary shows a high heterogeneity of both methods and
conclusions in previous research.  Indeed, existing accounts make conﬂicting predictions about the direction of any putative association between alexithymia and somatosensation.  On the one hand, somatosensory cortical areas (e. g.  right primary and secondary somatosensory
areas and the insula) are positively activated during emotion recognition in healthy volunteers (Adolphs, 2002), suggesting that high alexithymia might be associated with reduced somatosensory processing.  On
the other hand, the somatosensory ampliﬁcation concept predicts increased somatosensory processing at least for some somatosensory
modalities such as pain, and visceral sensation (Barsky Name, 1988;
Ihme Name, 2014; Kano Name, 2007; Perez, Barsky, Vago,
Baslet, & Silbersweig, 2015). 
Detailed understanding of relations between alexithymia and somatosensory processing has been hampered by the lack of psychophysiologically-validated measures of somatosensory processing in the
alexithymia literature.  Somatosensory systems can be divided into
several submodalities, each reﬂecting a distinct class of stimulus energy, peripheral receptor, aﬀerent pathways and cortical target.  Within
thermoception, for example, warm and cold sensations are mediated by
diﬀerent aﬀerent ﬁbres, and are therefore considered distinct submodalities.  Some somatosensory submodalities, such as mechanoreceptive light touch, are classically interpreted as exteroceptive,
while others, such as visceral baroreception, are considered interoceptive.  The theoretical and empirical confusion over somatosensory
processing in alexithymia may arise partly from lack of a systematic
experimental approach to measuring somatosensation itself.  Few studies of alexithymia have taken account of modern psychophysiological
approaches to pathway-speciﬁc somatosensory perception, and few
have tested multiple somatosensory submodalities.  Thus, the existence
and speciﬁcity of any link between somatosensory processing and
alexithymia remains unclear. 
We therefore performed two studies relating alexithymia scores to
performance on established psychophysiological quantitative sensory
testing (QST) battery (Rolke, Baron Name, 2006).  QST involves multiple
psychophysical tests, assessing the neurophysiological function of the
major somatosensory aﬀerent ﬁbre pathways from the skin (Hansson,
Backonja, & Bouhassira, 2007).  QST is widely used in neurology, and
extensive normative data are available (Rolke, Baron Name, 2006;
Rolke, Magerl Name, 2006).  Importantly, each QST subtest focuses on a
speciﬁc somatosensory submodality, so QST has potentially high sensitivity to identify selective deﬁcits in speciﬁc neurophysiological
pathways.  We used the following QST subtests: warm threshold, cold
threshold, pinprick radiant heat pain threshold, and somatosensory
detection.  These tests are thought to involve the following aﬀerent
pathways respectively: somatosensory detection – Aβ primarily, but
potentially also Aδ and C-ﬁbres; warm – C-ﬁbre; cold – Aδ-ﬁbre –K.  Borhani Name

(thought
interoceptive awareness
pinprick radiant heat pain- Aδ ﬁbres.  In the latter case, our methods
(see later) set the stimulus intensity above the Aδ threshold, which
reliably produces a distinctive pinprick sensation.  However, there is
inevitably a concurrent activation of lower-threshold C-ﬁbres signaling
innocuous warmth. 
In addition, we included established tests of tactile acuity (Aβﬁbre),
to depend on mechanosensitive receptors innervated by vagal aﬀerent ﬁbres in the atria and
venoatrial
junction, or mechanosensitive C-ﬁbres in the ventricles
(Longhust, 2004; Malliani, Lombardi, & Pagani, 1986), by intra-thoracic
detection of the force generated by changing blood-pressure on the
walls of the great vessels in surrounding mechanosensitive thoracic
tissues (Eichler and Katkin, 1994; ; Schandry Name, 1993), and possibly
also by cutaneous mechanosensitive ﬁbres overlying large arteries
(Critchley, Wiens, Rotshtein, Öhman, & Dolan, 2004; Khalsa, Rudrauf,
Sandesara, Olshansky, & Tranel, 2009)), and aﬀective touch (presumed
C-tactile mechanoreceptor pathway McGlone, Wessberg, & Olausson,
2014, though concurrent activation of Aβ cannot be avoided).  These
tests are not part of classical QST, but involve a degree of psychophysiological speciﬁcity, and which have previously been linked to alexithymia.  We hypothesised that if emotion recognition impairment in
alexithymia has a somatosensory grounding, this should be revealed by
an association between TAS scores and performance on one or more
subtests of QST.  Based on previous results, we predicted that any such
association would involve the ‘protopathic’, small-ﬁbre submodalities
that participate in conveying somatic states, rather than the ‘epicritic’,
large-ﬁbre submodalities that participate in somatosensory exteroception.

2. 1.  Methods
2. 1. 1.  Participants
In the absence of previous similar studies, we were interested in
whether a strong association between somatosensory processing and
alexithymia existed, so we based our a priori power calculation on a
relatively large assumed eﬀect size (0. 90).  A power calculation in
G*Power 3. 1 (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007) indicated that 40
participants would achieve a power of approximately 0. 80 in a twotailed between-groups independent t-test. 
189 volunteers (ﬁfty one males, mean age = 23. 7, range:18–40)
ﬁlled out the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20; Taylor,
Bagby, & Parker, 2003) online.  TAS scores range from 20 to 100.  Scores
of 61 or higher were considered as high alexithymia, while scores of 36
or lower were considered as low alexithymia (Taylor, Ryan, & Bagby,
1985).  For experiment 1, 20 healthy Individuals with high TAS-20 totals (six males, mean age = 24. 65, range: 19–35) and 20 with low TAS20 totals (six males, mean age = 25. 7, range:19–40) TAS-20 totals were
selected, using the cutoﬀs deﬁned above, in order to obtain an experimental sample varying widely in levels of the alexithymia trait.  The
20 low alexithymia (LA) participants had a TAS mean score of 31. 05
(SD = 3. 18, range: 25–35, corresponding to the lower TAS quartile
reported in the general population (Taylor Name, 1985), while the 20
high alexithymia (HA) participants had a TAS mean score of 66. 2
(SD = 5. 69, range: 61–77, corresponding to the upper TAS quartile
reported in the general population). 
In addition, the alexithymia
module of the structured interview for the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) (Mangelli, Semprini, Sirri, Fava, & Sonino,
2006; Porcelli & Rafanelli, 2010; Porcelli & Sonino, 2007) was also used
to conﬁrm the presence or absence of alexithymia.  At least 3 of 6
characteristics in this interview must be present
for alexithymia
(Porcelli & Rafanelli, 2010).  (LA:1. 6, SD = 0. 5, range:1–2;, HA:4. 6,
SD = 1. 14, range:3–6).  Participants were included in the study if i) they
had no history of neurological, major medical or psychiatric disorder
and ii) their scores on the TAS-20 and the DCPR were congruent(congruency was deﬁned as both scores on TAS20 and DCPR had to
indicate the same level of alexithymia.  For instance, to be considered in
high alexithymia group the score in TAS-20 had to be 61 or higher, and
DCPR score had to be 3 or higher).  No participant was excluded due to
discrepancy between TAS-20 and DCPR score.  Two participants were
excluded after completing the TAS online, but prior to experimental
testing, due to self-reported previous history of neurological or psychiatric disorder. 
Experimental data were obtained from the 40 included healthy
participants in a comprehensive standardized QST protocol consisting
of 7 tests: cold and warm thermal perception thresholds, pinprick pain
threshold, tactile acuity, aﬀective touch, interceptive awareness, and
somatosensory signal detection.  All participants performed the tests in
the same, stated order.  Fixed order testing was necessary for technical
reasons, and to avoid possible interactions between speciﬁc modalities
and those tested subsequently (Gröne Name, 2012).  For instance, it has
been found that applying thermal stimulation before mechanical stimuli might lead to mechanical pain sensitivity (Gröne Name, 2012).  The
whole experiment took about two hours and a half.  Participants provided written informed consent prior to the experiment and were paid
£7. 50 per h.  The experiment was approved by the UCL Research Ethics
Committee, and carried out in accordance with the provisions of the
Declaration of Helsinki. Sprecher,
