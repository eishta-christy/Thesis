Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) is a common
neurodevelopmental disorder with a worldwide prevalence around
5. 3% (Polanczyk, de Lima, Horta, Biederman, & Rohde, 2007).  The
electroencephalogram (EEG), as a non-invasive tool to measure brain
electrical activity, has been used frequently in research to objectively
reﬂect the abnormalities of AD/HD (Barry, Clarke, & Johnstone, 2003). 
Past studies have reported that patients with AD/HD showed increased
slow-wave activity and reduced fast-wave activity compared to healthy
controls, which results in a higher slow/fast wave ratio − commonly
measured as an elevated theta/beta ratio (TBR) (Barry & Clarke, 2009). 
An early meta-analysis demonstrated a large eﬀect size for the AD/HDcontrol group diﬀerence on TBR (Snyder & Hall, 2006).  In 2013, the
U. S.  Food and Drug Administration (2013) approved the use of TBR to
assist in the identiﬁcation and diagnosis of AD/HD. 
However, the diagnostic value of TBR in AD/HD is controversial as
recent studies have failed to replicate the group diﬀerence reported in
earlier studies (Arns, Conners, & Kraemer, 2013; Loo Name, 2013;
Ogrim, Kropotov, & Hestad, 2012; Zhang Name, in press).  Instead, researchers are proposing the use of TBR in AD/HD for a prognostic
purpose (Arns Name, 2013; Lenartowicz & Loo, 2014; Zhang Name, in
press).  The prognostic proposition focusses on using EEG to predict
individual diﬀerences in AD/HD rather than identifying the characteristics of AD/HD.  From this perspective, while TBR does not reliably diﬀerentiate the patients from healthy controls, patients with
elevated TBR show features diﬀering from those without elevated TBR. 
The argument is supported by the heterogeneous nature of TBR in AD/
HD − about 35% of patients are estimated to have elevated TBR
(Clarke Name, 2011).  In addition, the prognostic value is also supported
by EEG-based medication studies in which patients with higher TBR
responded better to stimulant treatment (Arns, 2012; Clarke, Barry,
McCarthy, & Selikowitz, 2002). 
One obstacle to using TBR for its prognostic value is to understand
its behavioral meaning.  The aberrant EEG activity in AD/HD was attributed to an arousal disorder in a prevailing EEG model of AD/HD, the
