Weight gain and obesity are a great health concern of the modern
Western world, in both Europe (Berghöfer Name, 2008) and the US
(Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, & Curtin, 2010) obesity has reached a prevalence of 30%.  Emotional eating, which is overeating during stress or
negative aﬀect seems to be an important factor in weight gain while it
increases food intake of speciﬁcally high fat and/or sweet foods
(Gibson, 2012; Greeno & Wing, 1994; Schepers & Markus, 2015).  The
cause of this unhealthy habit has not decisively been determined, although over the last years in both cognitive and biological scientiﬁc
ﬁelds this topic has been explored extensively.  For instance diﬀerences
in behavioral disinhibition (Guerrieri Name, 2007), attention bias
(Shafran, Lee, Cooper, Palmer, & Fairburn, 2007), restrained eating
styles (Greeno & Wing, 1994), heightened responses of reward areas of
the brain towards food related cues (Bohon, Stice, & Spoor, 2009) and
genetics (Keskitalo Name, 2008; Sung, Lee, Song, Lee, & Lee, 2010;
Tholin, Rasmussen, Tynelius, & Karlsson, 2005) all seem to partly explain emotional eating.  A system that is greatly involved in stress
resilience and therefore might play an important part in emotional
eating is the brain serotonergic (5-HT) system.  Dysfunction of this
neurotransmitter is associated with decreased stress resilience and increased intake of carbohydrate rich foods (Markus, 2008).  The serotonin transporter gene contains a polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) that inﬂuences availability of serotonin transporters thereby inﬂuencing 5-HT
eﬃcacy.  Carrying an S-allele of this gene (opposed to an L-allele) causes
increased hormonal and behavioral stress responsiveness (Gotlib,
Joormann, Minor, & Hallmayer, 2008; Markus & De Raedt, 2011;
Markus & Firk, 2009; Mueller, Brocke, Fries, Lesch, & Kirschbaum,
2010), greater brain responses to fearful stimuli (Hariri & Holmes,
2006; Murphy Name, 2013) and increased chances of aﬀective disorders
in response to stressful life events (Karg, Burmeister, Shedden, & Sen,
2011; Miller, Wankerl, Stalder, Kirschbaum, & Alexander, 2013).
