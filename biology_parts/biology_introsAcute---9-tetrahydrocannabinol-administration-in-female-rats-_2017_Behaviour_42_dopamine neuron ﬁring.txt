THC and other components in marijuana are among the most
commonly used illicit drugs in the world.  A recent report [1] indicates
over 181 million users world-wide, while an estimated 13. 1 million
people exhibit cannabis dependence globally [2].  Marijuana usage is
increasing in many countries, [3] and chronic use appears to be a risk
factor for several mental illnesses including psychosis [4] and depression [5].  Moreover, chronic use is also linked to reduced performance
on decision-making tasks [6,7].  It is therefore important to better understand how THC aﬀects the neural processes involved in cognition
and decision-making.  Previous studies have indicated deﬁcits in executive function, verbal and visual memory, and visuoperception following chronic cannabis use in humans [8].  Rodent models have likewise shown impairments in working memory [9,10] and spatial
memory [11] following acute THC administration.  Furthermore, acute
THC causes impairments in reversal learning in macaques [12], as well
as reversal learning and intradimensional set shifting impairments in
rats [13,14].  These ﬁndings have led to the proposal that THC impairs
cognitive ﬂexibility.  This is a nebulous term; for the purpose of this
paper we deﬁne cognitive ﬂexibility as the ability to change response
strategies when it is advantageous to do so.  Cognitive ﬂexibility is inﬂuenced by distinct neural processes that may compete or cooperate to
modulate behaviour [15].  For example, animals can learn to select
options based on action value estimates acrued over many trials (reinforcement learning), or could instead use heuristics to guide choice
[16].  Animals may also rely on innate strategies such as the propensity
to switch choices after reward omission, a widespread phenomenon
termed lose-shift responding [17–20].  These and other systems can be
used to derive choice, and can all manifest as cognitive ﬂexibility. 
A common methodological feature in reversal learning and set
shifting paradigms is a sudden and unexpected change in reward contingencies, which is used to assess how animals adapt choice strategy. 
Both lose-shift and reinforcement learning strategies are likely engaged
in these paradigms.  A physiological mechanism thought to be important
for such reinforcement-driven response adaptations is the reward prediction error (RPE) signaling properties of midbrain dopamine neurons
[21–23].  These neurons brieﬂy increase ﬁring rate following unexpectedly good reinforcements (rewards), signaling a positive RPE. 
Conversely, these neurons decrease ﬁring following unexpectedly poor

reinforcements such as reward omission, signaling a negative RPE.  This
RPE signal is suﬃcient to solve a variety of diﬃcult tasks [24].  Drugs or
diseases that aﬀect dopamine transmission are therefore expected to
impair this prediction error, and thereby impair reinforcement learning,
which has been demonstrated in many species and tasks [25–28]. 
Similar to other drugs of abuse, THC increases the ﬁring rates of
midbrain dopamine neurons [29] and increases dopamine release in
downstream targets such as the ventral striatum [30].  THC acts as an
agonist at the Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1), which is Gi coupled and
acts as an inhibitory presynaptic regulator of neurotransmitter release
[31].  CB1 is located on inhibitory aﬀerents to dopamine neurons [32]. 
It is therefore likely that CB1 agonism reduces inhibitory input to dopamine neurons.  We expect that this will suppress the pause in dopamine neuron ﬁring following reward omission and thereby attenuate
the negative RPE.  This should attenuate processes driven by reward
omission, such as lose-shift responding and reinforcement learning from
worse-than-expected reinforcements.
