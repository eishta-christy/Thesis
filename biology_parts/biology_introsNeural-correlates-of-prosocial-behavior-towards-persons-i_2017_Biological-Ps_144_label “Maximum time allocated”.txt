Working on a daily basis with patients in pain can be a trying experience for healthcare providers (HCPs).  Indeed, witnessing others in
pain can elicit a self-focused aversive reaction called personal distress
(Batson, 1987; Eisenberg & Eggum, 2009; Eisenberg & Fabes, 1990). 
This negative response to the suﬀering of others often motivates behavioral responses aimed at rapidly diminishing one’s own discomfort
instead of oﬀering help to alleviate the other person’s suﬀering (Batson,
1991; Cialdini Name, 1987; Tice, Bratslavsky & Baumeister, 2001). 
Successful regulation of personal distress is therefore necessary to feel
concern for others and oﬀer optimal help to persons(Eisenberg & Eggum, 2009; Eisenberg & Fabes, 1990).  Consequently,
HCPs in charge of treating pain in patients need to be able to adequately
regulate this self-oriented response in order to produce other-oriented
prosocial responses.  A study on HCPs’ neural response to pain in others
has validated this idea by showing that HCPs had, compared to control
participants, increased hemodynamic responses in regions associated
with self-regulation when witnessing painful stimulations applied
to patients, that is the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Cheng Name, 2007).  Using a similar
design, Decety and collaborators (Decety, Yang & Cheng, 2010) observed that physicians did not show the typical diﬀerentiation observed
in control participants between electrocortical responses to pictures
depicting painful and non-painful stimulations to patients.  The authors
interpreted this result as a down-regulation in HCPs of aﬀective processing when perceiving pain in others, allowing them to allocate
cognitive resources to the assistance of others.  It is therefore plausible
that this increased self-regulation of personal distress when confronted
with others’ suﬀering could make HCPs more able to oﬀer help towards
persons in pain than individuals with no clinical experience. 
On the other hand, clinical expertise has also been linked with a
tendency to underestimate the pain of patients compared to the patients’ own estimation or the estimation of control participants (Cheng
Name, 2007; Decety Name, 2010; Kappesser, de C.  Williams & Prkachin,
2006; Prkachin, Solomon & Ross, 2007).  This underestimation bias has
been shown to extend across diﬀerent settings and to increase with the
amount of clinical experience (Gleichgerrcht & Decety, 2014; Solomon,
2001).  The fact that more experienced clinicians tend to underestimate
the pain of patients to a greater extent suggests that repeated exposure

to patients in pain could contribute to this bias (Prkachin Name, 2007). 
Several studies (Coll, Gr & goire, Prkachin, & Jackson, 2016; Gr & goire,
Coll, Tremblay, Prkachin, & Jackson, 2016; Prkachin, Mass, & Mercer,
2004; Prkachin & Rocha, 2010) added support to this hypothesis by
showing that participants with no healthcare experience brieﬂy exposed to intense expressions of pain are subsequently less willing to
consider moderate pain expressions as painful.  One immediate consequence of this bias in HCPs could be the inadequate management of
pain in patients.  Indeed, if the pain of the other is perceived as less
intense, it is likely that the observer will be less motivated to help relieve it (Prkachin, Kaseweter & Browne, 2015). 
Based on studies indicating that HCPs show increased emotional
regulation when witnessing pain, one would expect that they would
oﬀer more prosocial behavior towards persons in pain than non HCP
individuals because they can regulate self-oriented feelings of distress
more eﬀectively.  However, based on studies suggesting an underestimation of others’ pain intensity in HCPs, one would expect that
HCPs would oﬀer less prosocial behavior to persons in pain because
they perceive the pain of others as less intense than individuals with no
healthcare experience.  In order to shed light on these conﬂicting hypotheses, the present study compared HCPs and healthy control participants with no healthcare experience (CTL) on prosocial behavior towards persons in pain. 
In a ﬁrst experiment a behavioral paradigm was developed, in
which participants were asked to decide the amount of help they would
oﬀer patients expressing various levels of pain, knowing that oﬀering
more help would help reduce the patients’ pain but would have the
undesirable consequence of lengthening the experimental task.  In a
second experiment, functional neuroimaging was used in order to
provide additional insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying
this eﬀect.  New groups of HCP and CTL participants performed the
same prosocial task in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
setting.  It was hypothesized that compared to CTL participants, HCP
participants would show more prosocial behavior towards patients in
pain and that this would be linked to reduced self-reported personal
distress when witnessing others in pain and increased activation, during
the observation of patients in pain, in regions associated with selfregulation such as the DLPFC and the MPFC and decreased activation in
regions associated with aﬀective responses to pain in others such as the
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the anterior insular cortices.  It was
also predicted that increased hemodynamic responses when witnessing
pain in others in the DLPFC and MPFC would be linked with reduced
self-reported personal distress and increased prosocial behavior.

2. 1.  Participants
HCP and CTL participants were recruited through advertisements
sent to a university e-mail list, and all participants gave written informed consent to take part in these studies.  The Institut de réadaptation
en déﬁcience physique de Québec Research Ethics Committee approved
both studies and participants received a monetary compensation for
their involvement.  All participants received a ﬁxed monetary compensation independently of the time they spent helping during the experimental task.  Exclusion criteria for both studies included any reported history of painful, neurological or psychiatric disorder. 
Additional exclusion criteria for the fMRI experiment included any
contraindication to the MRI magnet, being over 40 years of age and
being left-handed.  Inclusion criteria for the HCP groups included
having practiced a certiﬁed healthcare profession with direct contact
with patients in pain for at least two years.  All HCPs recruited in this
study were either licensed physiotherapists or nurses that worked in a
hospital or rehabilitation setting.  Participants included in the CTL
groups had not studied in, and had no previous work experience in a
healthcare related ﬁeld. 
2. 1. 1.  Behavioral experiment
Fourty-four participants took part in the behavioral version of the
experiment.  Twenty-two were HCP (two males, 20 females) aged on
average 32. 64 years (SD = 12. 85); range: 21–57 years).  There were six
physiotherapists and 16 registered nurses with an average of 11 years of
experience in their ﬁeld (SD = 10. 58, range: 2–35 years) and 14. 90
years of education (SD = 1. 44, range 12–18 years).  The CTL group was
composed of 22 participants (ﬁve males, 17 females) with an average of
31. 50 years of age (SD = 9. 012, range: 20–50) and 15. 18 years of
education (SD = 1. 81, range: 12–18 years).  For the analyses of the
behavioral variables, data collected during the behavioral and fMRI
experiments were pooled due to the similarity of the design performed. 
According to the G*Power 3 software (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang & Buchner,
2007), with an alpha signiﬁcance threshold of 0. 05 and 80% power, an
eﬀect size of d = 0. 66 is necessary to ﬁnd a group diﬀerence (twotailed) using this sample size.  This sample size was thus considered
suﬃcient considering the larger eﬀect sizes observed in previous studies
comparing vicarious pain perception between HCP and CTL participants (Cheng Name, 2007; Decety Name, 2010). 
2. 1. 2.  fMRI experiment
Thirty new participants took part in the fMRI version of the experiment.  HCP (ﬁve males, 10 females) were aged on average 28. 47
years old (SD = 4. 64, range: 23–38 years).  Four were physiotherapists
and 11 were registered nurses.  The HCPs in the fMRI experiment had an
average of 6. 30 years of experience in their ﬁeld (SD = 3. 93, range:
3–15 years) and 15. 53 years of education (SD = 1. 64, range 13–18
years).  The CTL sample was composed of 15 participants (ﬁve males, 10
females) with an average of 25. 27 years of age (SD = 4. 07, range:
20–35 years) and 15. 37 years of education (SD = 1. 36, range: 14–18
years).  Participants in the HCP group were thus older than participants
in the CTL group but this diﬀerence did not reach statistical signiﬁcance
[t(28) = 2. 01, p = 0. 06].  One participant in the CTL group was a replacement participant for a participant that moved excessively during
fMRI scanning (over 20% of volumes removed due to motion-related
artifacts, see below).  This sample size was chosen based on a previous
study successfully showing diﬀerences in brain responses during vicarious pain perception between HCP and CTL participants (Cheng
Name, 2007). 
2. 2.  Visual stimuli
The visual stimuli consisted of still frames extracted from 1 s clips
from the University of Northern British Columbia-McMaster Shoulder
Pain Archive (Lucey, Cohn, Prkachin, Solomon, & Matthews, 2011;
Prkachin & Solomon, 2008).  These clips consist in facial expressions of
actual patients doing painful (aﬀected limb) or non-painful (non-affected limb) shoulder range of motion tests in a supine position.  The
large majority of the patients selected (93%) were of Caucasian ethnicity, which is very similar to the population of Quebec and the recruited2. 2. 1.  Behavioral experiment
Twenty clips of diﬀerent patients (10 males, 10 females; 14 pain
stimuli, 6 neutral stimuli [i. e. , neutral facial expressions]) were used
from the archive for the purpose of the behavioral study.  For pain stimuli, six frames were extracted from each clip.  A test frame was ﬁrst
chosen by visually inspecting the clip and selecting the peak in the pain
expression of the patient.  Four feedback frames were then visually selected from the same clip in order to illustrate a gradual decrease in the
pain expressions.  Finally, a neutral frame with the same patient expressing no pain was extracted from the same clip.  For neutral stimuli,
only a neutral frame was chosen.  Stimuli were presented with E-Prime
2. 0 software (Psychology Software Tools Inc. , Sharpsburg PA, USA) on
a 17-inch computer monitor located at approximately 60 cm from the
participant, at a resolution of 704 × 480 pixels. M. -P.  Coll Name
2. 2. 2.  fMRI experiment
The same frames as in the behavioral experiment were used for the
fMRI experiment and six neutral frames from diﬀerent patients (3 females) were added in order to get an equal number of pain and neutral
trials (28 patients; 14 pain stimuli and 14 neutral stimuli).  Stimuli were
presented at a resolution of 704 × 480 pixels on a screen outside the
scanner which participants viewed using a 20 × 9 cm mirror placed on
the head coil. 
2. 3.  Dispositional empathy measure
After the experiments, all participants completed the Interpersonal
Reactivity Index (IRI; (Davis, 1980).  The IRI consists of a 28-item selfreport questionnaire providing individual scores on four subscales:
Perspective Taking (PT), Fantasy (FS), Empathic Concern (EC) and
Personal Distress (PD).  The PT subscale measures the capacity to understand the perspective of others, the FS subscale measures the tendency to identify with characters from ﬁctional situations and has been
shown to be related to social anxiety and shyness (Davis, 1980), the EC
subscale measures feelings of compassion toward persons in distress,
and the PD subscale measures self-oriented feelings of distress when
facing others’ negative experiences (Davis, 1980). 
2. 4.  Procedure
All participants were asked to put themselves in the role of a
healthcare professional in charge of treating pain in patients.  They were
told that they would meet diﬀerent patients and that for each of them,
they should decide how much time they wanted to devote to treating
his or her pain.  They were also told that the more help they oﬀered, the
more the patient’s pain would be reduced, and that they would see the
patient’s resulting facial expression following their treatment.  In order
to avoid introducing a bias associated with the knowledge of HCPs on
pain management interventions, no speciﬁc type of help (e. g.  pharmacological, social) was speciﬁed and the general term “help” was always used to describe the participants’ action towards patients. 
To ensure that participants would not simply oﬀer the maximum
amount of help to all patients, they were warned that oﬀering more
time to help a patient had a number of consequences, notably that it
would increase their workload and thus lengthen the experimental task. 
However, they were not made aware of the amount of help they would
have to oﬀer to completely alleviate the pain of patients.  It was also
made clear that the amount of help oﬀered would not inﬂuence the
monetary compensation they would receive for their participation. 
2. 4. 1.  Behavioral experiment
For each experimental trial (see Fig.  1) participants ﬁrst saw a
Biological Psychology 128 (2017) 1–10
ﬁxation cross for 1 s followed by the test frame (2. 5 s) showing a patient
doing a shoulder movement and who either expressed pain or kept a
neutral expression.  After the test frame, a visual analog scale (VAS) was
presented for 3. 5 s with the label “No help” at the left extremity and the
label “Maximum time allocated” on the right extremity [in French:
“Aucune aide” and “Temps maximal alloué”].  A cursor initially appeared at a random position on the VAS and participants were asked to
indicate how much time they wanted to oﬀer to help the patient they
had just seen by moving the cursor on the VAS using two adjacent keys
on the keyboard.
