https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 018Sleep is an essential and evolutionarily conserved
behavioral state whose regulation remains poorly understood.  To identify genes that regulate vertebrate
sleep, we recently performed a genetic screen in
zebraﬁsh, and here we report the identiﬁcation of
neuropeptide Y (NPY) as both necessary for normal
daytime sleep duration and sufﬁcient to promote
sleep.  We show that overexpression of NPY increases sleep, whereas mutation of npy or ablation
of npy-expressing neurons decreases sleep.  By
analyzing sleep architecture, we show that NPY
regulates sleep primarily by modulating the length
of wake bouts.  To determine how NPY regulates
sleep, we tested for
interactions with several
systems known to regulate sleep, and provide
anatomical, molecular, genetic, and pharmacological evidence that NPY promotes sleep by inhibiting
noradrenergic signaling.  These data establish NPY
as an important vertebrate sleep/wake regulator
and link NPY signaling to an established arousal-promoting system. 
INTRODUCTION
Sleep is among the most basic needs of living organisms, yet
mechanisms that regulate sleep remain poorly understood. 
Several neuropeptides have been implicated in regulating
mammalian sleep [1], including hypocretin [2–4], which promotes wakefulness, and galanin [5–8] and melanin-concentrating hormone [9–12], which promote sleep, suggesting that
examining additional neuropeptides may identify novel mechanisms that regulate sleep.  Identifying these mechanisms using
mammalian models has been challenging due to their poor
amenability for large-scale screens, although such screens are
possible [13].  As an alternative approach, several groups have
used behavioral criteria to study sleep-like states in simpler
model organisms that are amenable to screens,
including
Drosophila [14–22], C.  elegans [23–25], and zebraﬁsh [26–30]. 
In particular, several groups have demonstrated behavioral,
anatomical, genetic, and pharmacological conservation of sleep
between zebraﬁsh and mammals, establishing zebraﬁsh as a
vertebrate sleep model [26–28, 30–33].  We previously described
a screen for genes whose overexpression affects zebraﬁsh
sleep, and reported that the neuropeptide neuromedin U is
necessary and sufﬁcient for normal levels of arousal [29].  Here
we demonstrate that another neuropeptide identiﬁed in the
screen, neuropeptide Y (NPY), is necessary for daytime sleep
and sufﬁcient to promote sleep. 
injection of
NPY is widely expressed in the brain and has been implicated
in regulating endocrine, behavioral, and circadian processes
[34], and is perhaps best known for its role in promoting feeding
[35–38].  NPY has also been shown to affect sleep, but its role in
this behavioral state remains unclear.  Several studies have
shown that
in vitro-synthesized NPY into the
rodent brain [39–45] or intravenously into young healthy [46] or
depressed [47] humans can induce sleep or reduce locomotor
activity.  However, other rodent studies reported the opposite effect [48–50].  The basis for these disparate reports is unclear, but
may be due to different sites and doses of NPY injection, or the
use of in vitro-synthesized peptide that may vary in different
preparations and from endogenous NPY.  Understanding the
role of NPY in mammalian sleep is also confounded by links
between mechanisms that regulate feeding and sleep [48–51]. reports of wake promotion by injected NPY also
observed increased feeding [48–50], suggesting thatincreased wakefulness may result
from increased feeding. 
npy mutant mice exhibit several phenotypes, including increased
anxiety, depression-like behavior, and cognitive deﬁcits [52, 53],
and are less susceptible to diet-induced obesity [54].  However,
an analysis of sleep in these animals and a role for npy-expressing neurons in sleep have not been described.  As a result, the
role of NPY in vertebrate sleep remains unclear. 
Here we show that NPY is sufﬁcient to promote sleep in zebraﬁsh, whereas loss of npy or npy-expressing neurons results in
less daytime sleep.  We also show that NPY promotes sleep by
inhibiting the wake-promoting noradrenergic system, providing
a mechanistic basis for sleep regulation by NPY.  Together with
the requirement of noradrenergic signaling for the wake-promoting function of hypocretin [55, 56], these results suggest that the
noradrenergic system integrates neuropeptidergic signals that
regulate sleep/wake states.

Figure 1.  Overexpression of Zebraﬁsh NPY Increases Sleep and Arousal Threshold
(A–G) Overexpression of zebraﬁsh NPY following a heat shock at 3 p. m.  resulted in decreased locomotor activity (A and B) and increased sleep (C and D), due to
more sleep bouts (E) and shorter sleep (F) and wake (G) bouts.  Yellow bars indicate heat shock (HS).  Pre-HS and post-HS quantify data for day 5 before and
after HS.  Mean ± SEM from four experiments is shown. 
(H) Representative stimulus-response curve for Tg(hsp:npy) animals compared to WT siblings following HS.  Data points represent mean ± SEM.  Dashed lines
mark ETP50 value for each genotype.  Tg(hsp:npy) animals had an ETP50 value of 24. 2 versus 8. 2 for WT siblings (293% increase, p < 0. 05 by extra sum-of-squares
F test).

in which a heat shock-inducible promoter (hsp) regulates the
expression of genes that encode for secreted proteins into
wild-type (WT) zebraﬁsh embryos at the one-cell stage.  We
used human open reading frames (ORFs) encoding secreted
proteins from the hORFeome v3. 1 library [57] because there
was no resource of zebraﬁsh ORFs.  Co-injection of each plasmid
with tol2 transposase mRNA resulted in incorporation of the hspregulated transgene into the genome in many cells of each animal and enabled heat shock-induced overexpression [29].  We
then compared sleep/wake behaviors in injected animals before
and after heat shock and to negative control animals injected
with an hsp:egfp plasmid.  One gene whose overexpression
increased sleep at night (Z score 1. 8) encoded human NPY (Figure S1A).  Even though zebraﬁsh exhibit high levels of sleep at
night, NPY-overexpressing animals were 28% less active and
slept 34% more than control animals during the night after
heat shock (p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 01, two-tailed Student’s t test)
(Figures S1B–S1G).  We observed a similar phenotype during
the day before heat shock that did not reach statistical signiﬁcance, consistent with leaky expression from hsp that often is
observed using this transient injection assay, but is not observed
using stable transgenic lines [29]. 
Overexpression of Zebraﬁsh NPY Reduces Locomotor
Activity and Increases Sleep in Zebraﬁsh
Using reciprocal BLAST searches, we identiﬁed a single zebraﬁsh
npy ortholog, which encodes for a preproprotein that generates a
predicted 36-amino acid mature peptide that is 89% identical to
the human and mouse orthologs (Figure S1H).  npy is widely expressed in the mammalian brain, particularly in the hypothalamus,
amygdala, locus coeruleus (LC), and cerebral cortex [58, 59].  Using
in situ hybridization (ISH) with an npy-speciﬁc probe, immunostaining for total extracellular signal-regulated kinase (t-ERK), and image registration to the Z-Brain atlas [60], we found that npy is similarly expressed in several discrete nuclei within the larval zebraﬁsh
brain (Figures S1I–S1N; Movie S1).  We also observed npy expression in the retina (data not shown) but not in other tissues. 
To test whether overexpression of zebraﬁsh NPY affects
sleep, we generated Tg(hsp:npy) zebraﬁsh.  Tg(hsp:npy) animals
and their WT siblings had similar amounts of locomotor activity
and sleep before heat shock (Figures 1A–1D).  However,
following a heat shock at 3 p. m. , Tg(hsp:npy) animals were
50% less active (Figures 1A and 1B) and slept 111% more (Figures 1C and 1D) than their WT siblings for the rest of the day
(p < 0. 0001, two-tailed Student’s t test).  The phenotype resulted
from a 230% increase in the number of sleep bouts (Figure 1E)
and an 85% decrease in the length of wake bouts (Figure 1G)
(p < 0. 0001, two-tailed Student’s t test), with a smaller decrease
in the length of sleep bouts (Figure 1F), and thus is primarily due
to fragmentation of the wake state. 
The increase in sleep after the heat shock-induced pulse of
NPY overexpression dampened by nighttime.  A previous study
showed that the circadian system inhibits sleep in the evening,
when homeostatic sleep drive is high [61], suggesting that the
circadian system might limit NPY overexpression-induced sleep
to the day.  To test whether NPY overexpression can also increase
sleep at night, we heat shocked animals during the last hour of the
day.  We found that Tg(hsp:npy) animals were 46% less active
(Figures S2A–S2C) and slept 54% more (Figures S2D–S2F)
than their WT siblings during the night (p < 0. 0001, two-tailed Student’s t test), similar to the daytime phenotype when NPY overexpression was induced in the afternoon.  This phenotype was due
to longer sleep bouts (Figure S2H) and shorter wake bouts (Figure S2J), with no change in the number of sleep bouts (Figure S2G).  These results suggest that dampening of NPY-induced
sleep at night following heat shock in the afternoon is due to
declining levels of NPY rather than effects of the circadian clock. 
Light affects locomotor activity and sleep in zebraﬁsh [27, 28],
as it does in mammals [62].  To determine whether light affects
NPY overexpression-induced sleep, we entrained larvae by
raising them in 14:10-hr light:dark (LD) conditions for 4 days,
and then transferred them to constant dark before inducing
NPY overexpression.  NPY-overexpressing animals were 54%
less active and slept 80% more than WT siblings during the rest
of the subjective day (Figures S2K–S2N) (p < 0. 0001, two-tailed
Student’s t test).  This phenotype was due to more sleep bouts
and shorter wake bouts, with no change in the length of sleep
bouts (Figures S2O–S2Q).  Hence, NPY overexpression promotes
sleep independent of lighting condition and circadian phase. 
Overexpression of NPY Increases Arousal Threshold
Sleep is distinguished from quiet wakefulness by reduced
sensory responsiveness [63].  Because NPY overexpression increases sleep, we asked whether it also alters arousal threshold
by monitoring responses to mechano-acoustic stimuli.  We found
that the stimulus intensity at which we observed the halfmaximal response (effective tap power 50; ETP50) was 290%
higher for Tg(hsp:npy) animals than their WT siblings (Figure 1H)
(p < 0. 05 by extra sum-of-squares F test).  Thus, NPY overexpression increases arousal threshold, consistent with increased
sleep.  We next asked whether NPY overexpression affects
arousal in awake and/or sleeping animals by allowing 5 min between trials.  According to the behavioral deﬁnition of sleep, we
scored animals as awake if they moved during the minute before
a stimulus was delivered.  We used stimulus intensities of 2. 3,
3. 0, and 4. 0 arbitrary units, which were lower than the ETP50
values of both Tg(hsp:npy) and WT animals.  NPY-overexpressing animals were less responsive to these stimuli than WT siblings during both awake (Figure 1I) and sleep (Figure 1J) states. 
These data suggest that NPY overexpression decreases arousal
in awake animals and increases sleep depth in sleeping animals. 
npy Mutant Zebraﬁsh Are More Active and Sleep Less
during the Day
We next asked whether endogenous npy is required for normal
sleep/wake behaviors by using the zinc ﬁnger nuclease method
(I and J) Overexpression of NPY reduced the response of Tg(hsp:npy) animals to the stimulus compared to WT siblings during both awake (I) and sleep (J) states. 
Stimulus intensities of 2. 3, 3. 0, and 4. 0 arbitrary units (a. u. ) were tested.  A dose-dependent response was observed for WT animals, but not their Tg(hsp:npy)
siblings.  Bar graphs show mean ± SEM.

to generate zebraﬁsh containing a predicted null mutation in the
npy ORF [64].  We isolated zebraﬁsh containing a 17 nt deletion
in the second exon of the npy gene [64], which results in a translational frameshift at the beginning of the mature peptide domain
(Figure 2A), generating a protein that lacks the mature peptide
domain and thus is most likely nonfunctional.  Homozygous
mutant animals are viable and fertile, and lack obvious developmental defects. 
Consistent with the NPY overexpression phenotype, npy / 
larvae were 23% more active and slept 36% less during the
day than their npy+/+ siblings (p < 0. 0001 and p < 0. 01, oneway ANOVA, Holm-Sidak test) (Figures 2B, 2C, 2E, and 2F). 
These effects were due to fewer sleep bouts (Figure 2H) and
longer wake bouts (Figure 2L), with no effect on the length ofsleep bouts (Figure 2J).  Thus, reduced daytime sleep in npy
animals is due to consolidation of the wake state.  We did not
phenotypes at night.  These data indicate that
observe npy
endogenous npy is required for normal daytime sleep amounts. 
Microinjection of NPY into the hamster suprachiasmatic
nucleus phase shifts the locomotor activity circadian rhythm in
constant light (LL) [65, 66], suggesting that NPY may regulate
entrainment or expression of circadian rhythms.  To test whether
endogenous npy is required for circadian regulation of locomotor
activity and sleep, we tested larvae that were entrained for
4 days in LD, then monitored for 24 hr in LD and then for 48 hr
in LL.  Absence of npy had no obvious effect on the locomotor
activity or sleep circadian period length or phase (Figures 3A
animals were more active
and 3D).  As expected, in LD, npy
(Figures 3A and S3A) and slept less (Figures 3D and S3C) than
their npy+/+ and npy+/ 
siblings during the day, with no phenotype at night.  The daytime phenotype was due to fewer sleep
bouts and longer wake bouts (Figures S3E and S3I).  Following
animals were more active by 30% and
the shift to LL, npy
26% during the subjective day and night,
respectively,
compared to their npy+/+ siblings (p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 01, onelarvae
way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak test) (Figures 3A–3C).  npy
also slept 40% less during the subjective day and night
(p < 0. 0001 and p < 0. 001, one-way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak test)
(Figures 3D–3F).  These phenotypes were primarily due to longer
wake bouts (Figures 3K and 3L), although there were also fewer
(Figures 3G and 3H) and shorter (Figures 3I and 3J) sleep bouts. 
These results indicate that npy is not required for circadian regulation of locomotor activity or sleep in zebraﬁsh larvae but rather
regulates sleep in a light-dependent manner.  / Ablation of npy-Expressing Neurons Increases
Locomotor Activity and Decreases Sleep
As an alternative approach to test the hypothesis that NPY is
necessary for normal sleep duration, we ablated npy-expressing
neurons.  To this end, we generated Tg(npy:kalta4) zebraﬁsh, in
which NPY neurons express an optimized version of the transcriptional activator Gal4 (KalTA4).  To verify the speciﬁcity of
this transgene, we performed double ﬂuorescence ISH (FISH)
using probes speciﬁc for npy and kalta4.  We observed that kalta4
is expressed in >80% of npy-expressing neurons (>95% for
some brain regions), and that >92% of kalta4-expressing neurons express npy (Figure S5A; Table S1).  We mated these ﬁsh
to Tg(uas:nfsb-mcherry) animals [67], resulting in the expression
of nitroreductase (nfsb) in npy-expressing neurons (Figure 4A). NFSB is a bacterial protein that converts the inert prodrug metronidazole (MTZ) into a cytotoxic DNA-crosslinking agent, thus
enabling drug-inducible ablation of the targeted cell type [68]. 
We treated Tg(npy:kalta4);Tg(uas:nfsb-mcherry) and Tg(npy:
kalta4) sibling control animals with MTZ or DMSO vehicle control
for 48 hr (from 3 days post-fertilization [dpf] to 5 dpf).  MTZ treatment almost completely eliminated mCherry-labeled cells in
double-transgenic animals (Figures 4A–4C), indicating loss of
most npy-expressing neurons.  Consistent with these observations, we detected TUNEL labeling in npy-expressing neurons
in Tg(npy:kalta4);Tg(uas:nfsb-mcherry) animals treated with
MTZ, but not in those treated with DMSO (Figures S5B–S5D),
indicating that MTZ treatment induces apoptosis of npy-exphenotype, npypressing neurons.  Consistent with the npy
ablated animals were 23% more active (Figures 4C and 4D)
and slept 28% less (Figures 4F and 4G) (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 05,
two-tailed Student’s t test) compared to sibling controls during
the day.  This phenotype was due to fewer sleep bouts (Figure 4I)
and longer wake bouts (Figure 4M), indicating consolidation of
animals.  To conﬁrm that the
the wake state, similar to npy
Tg(uas:nfsb-mcherry) transgene alone does not cause a behavioral phenotype, we crossed Tg(npy:kalta4)/+;Tg(uas:nfsbmcherry)/+ to WT ﬁsh, excluded animals that were positive for
mCherry, and treated the remaining animals with MTZ.  We
observed no difference in locomotor activity or sleep among animals of these three genotypes (Figure S4).  The cell ablation
phenotype was slightly weaker than that of the npy mutant,
most likely because the npy:kalta4 transgene is not expressed
in all npy-expressing neurons.  Because a small number of neurons express kalta4 but not npy in some brain regions (8% in
the subpallium, <5% in other brain regions; Figure S5A;
Table S1), it is possible that ablation of these NPY-negative cells
is responsible for the behavioral phenotype.  However, this is unlikely to be the case, due to the small number of cells involved
and because the NPY neuron ablation phenotype is consistent
with the npy mutant phenotype, suggesting that both NPY and
npy-expressing neurons are necessary for normal daytime sleep / 
The NPY Overexpression Phenotype Is Not Blocked by
Manipulation of Several Pathways Known to RegulateTo identify genetic mechanisms through which NPY affects
sleep, we tested whether the NPY overexpression phenotype
is suppressed in zebraﬁsh containing mutations in other genes
implicated in regulating sleep (Table S2).  We found that the
NPY overexpression phenotype persisted in larvae containing
null mutations in histidine decarboxylase (hdc) [69], hypocretin
receptor (hcrtr) [27], corticotropin releasing hormone a (crha)
(C. S.
