Motor imagery is deﬁned as the mental execution of an action
without any physical movement or muscle activation [1].  Brain activity
patterns during motor imagery are similar to those during the corresponding physical execution; the primary motor cortex (M1), premotor
cortex, supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and basal ganglia are
activated during motor imagery [2–7].  In addition, many studies have
reported signiﬁcant improvement of motor skills in patients with stroke
as well as in healthy persons after motor imagery training [8–10].
