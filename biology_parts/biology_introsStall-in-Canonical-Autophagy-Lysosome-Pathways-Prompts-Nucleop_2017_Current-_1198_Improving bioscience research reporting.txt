The terminal stages of neuronal degeneration
and death in neurodegenerative diseases remain
elusive.  Autophagy is an essential catabolic process frequently failing in neurodegeneration.  Selective autophagy routes have recently emerged,
including nucleophagy, deﬁned as degradation of
nuclear components by autophagy.  Here, we
show that,
for the polyglutamine disease dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy
(DRPLA), progressive acquirement of an ataxic
phenotype is linked to severe cerebellar cellular pathology, characterized by nuclear degeneration
through nucleophagy-based LaminB1 degradation
and excretion.  We ﬁnd that canonical autophagy
is stalled in DRPLA mice and in human ﬁbroblasts
from patients of DRPLA.  This is evidenced by
accumulation of p62 and downregulation of LC3I/II conversion as well as reduced Tfeb expression. 
Chronic autophagy blockage in several conditions,
including DRPLA and Vici syndrome, an early-onset
autolysosomal pathology, leads to the activation of
alternative clearance pathways including Golgi
membrane-associated
nucleophagy-based
LaminB1 degradation and excretion.  The combination of these alternative pathways and canonical
autophagy blockade, results in dramatic nuclear
pathology with disruption of the nuclear organization, bringing about
terminal cell atrophy and
degeneration.  Thus, our ﬁndings identify a novel
progressive mechanism for the terminal phases of
neuronal cell degeneration and death in human
neurodegenerative diseases and provide a link beand
tween autophagy block, activation of alternative
pathways for degradation, and excretion of cellular
components. 
INTRODUCTION
Nuclear homeostasis has recently been the focus of attention in
aggregation-prone neurodegenerative disorders.  In particular,
defects in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and deregulation of nuclear matrix have been identiﬁed as potential pathomechanisms
in several conditions [1–4].  Mutation in genes encoding nuclear
lamina constituents have been associated with degradation of
nuclear components by autophagy [5], in a process further
deﬁned as nucleophagy. 
Autophagy affects onset and progression of several human
reﬂecting its key role as a
neurodegenerative diseases,
regulator of neuronal proteostasis and organelle quality control [6].  Bulk or selected cargos are recruited by autophagy
receptors, like p62, to forming double-membrane vesicles,
the autophagosomes, marked by the lipid-conjugated form
of LC3, LC3-II.  Mature autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes
to form autolysosomes where the cargo is digested by lysosomal enzymes and basic molecules are recycled back to
the cytoplasm [7].  Nucleophagy, a selective autophagy mechanism, has been linked to LaminB1 degradation through
direct interaction with LC3 as a mechanism of protection
from oncogenesis and of
toward cellular
senescence [8].  However, the importance of nucleophagy
and its relationship with neuronal degeneration has not
been established.

Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are neurological conditions due to an expanded CAG repeat resulting in polyQ
stretches in the encoded protein.  This family of disorders
includes Huntington’s disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian
atrophy (DRPLA), and several spinocerebellar ataxias.  DRPLA
is caused by the expansion of a CAG stretch in the

choreoathetoid symptoms as well as myoclonus, generalized
epilepsy, and dementia with extensive cellular degeneration

the dentate nucleus, DN) [10]. 
recapitulating important aspects of
Several DRPLA mouse models have been previously generated, all
the disease
[11–13].  We have predicted dysfunctional autophagy from
previous Drosophila studies on DRPLA [14, 15].  Here, we
show that progressive development of an ataxic phenotype
in DRPLA mice is linked to severe cellular pathology in
relevant neuroanatomical regions.  We reveal that neurodegeneration is associated with a stall in canonical autophagy
and the activation of alternative pathways of Golgi-dependent
and nucleophagy-based degradation and excretion of
LaminB1,
leading to disruption of nuclear integrity and to
cell atrophy. 
<Middle> RESULTS. 
Progression of Motor Behavior Defects in DRPLA Mice
The behavioral phenotypes of ATN1-FL-26Q-84 (ATN1-FL-26Q)
and ATN1-FL-65Q-105 (ATN1-FL-65Q) mouse lines were evaluated in greater detail than previously reported.  Compared to
both wild-type (WT) mice and the ATN1-FL-26Q-84 (ATN1-FL26Q) line, the ATN1-FL-65Q-105 (ATN1-FL-65Q) line showed
clear decline in the rotarod (Figures S1A and S1B) and grip
strength tests (Figures 1A–1D).  This was also reﬂected in the
earlier onset of jerky movements, tremors, hind limb clasping,
seizures, and a stronger progressive lack of weight gain (Figures
S1C and S1D; Movie S1). 
Furthermore, the ATN1-FL-26Q and ATN1-FL-65Q lines
seemed to be hyperactive compared to WT.  ATN1-FL-26Q
mice showed increased explorative behavior (Figure S1E;
Movie S2), while the ATN1-FL-65Q mice appeared rather
aggressive and anxious, as reﬂected in increased thigmotaxis (Figure 1E) [16].  The ATN1-FL-26Q line also showed a
signiﬁcant increase in general activity as compared to WT
mice (Figures 1F and S1F).  ATN1-FL-65Q, but not ATN1FL-26Q, displayed a severely altered, distinctively ataxic
gait (Figure 1G). 
Stall in Autophagy in DRPLA
Previous Drosophila studies indicated a blockage of autophagic
clearance in DRPLA [14]. 
Lipofuscin accumulates during aging and also in lysosomal
storage disorders with dysfunctional autophagy [17].  We found
a signiﬁcant accumulation of lipofuscin in DRPLA mouse models
in several brain regions (Figures 2A–2C, S2A, and S2B). 
This was conﬁrmed in transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) micrographs from DN cells (Figures 2D–2F) showing electron-dense tertiary lysosomes, characterized as lipofuscin,
especially in the ATN1-FL-65Q mice (Figures 2F and 2G). 
Furthermore, in ATN1-FL-65Q we observed accumulations of
multilamellar bodies (Figure 2I), and of double-membrane autophagic vesicles, often containing partially preserved debris (Figures 2J–2L), suggesting incomplete digestion. 
The autophagy ﬂux was evaluated in vivo using GFP-LC3
transgenic mice [18].  DN cells in ATN1-FL-65Q mice showed a
signiﬁcant increase in GFP-LC3 puncta, as early as 3 weeks of
age, with further increase observed in end-stage animals (Figures 2M and 2N).  Similar effects were observed in the RN in
the brainstem (Figure S2E), but not in the GP (Figure S2F) and
in any other forebrain region (Figure S2E).  The ATN1-FL-26Q
line showed an initial increase of GFP-LC3 puncta in the DN at
3 weeks but not at end-stage (Figures 2M and 2N) in any of the
brain areas analyzed (Figures S2E and S2F). 
The number of LAMP2A positive lysosomes did not differ
across genotypes (Figure S2C); however, the number of GFPLC3/LAMP2A double-positive autolysosomes was increased in
ATN1-FL-65Q (and partially in ATN1-FL-26Q) DN cells at 3 weeks
(Figure S2D).  At end-stage, normalizing the GFP-LC3/LAMP2A
double-positive puncta, over the total of GFP-LC3 puncta (reﬂecting the ratio of autolysosomes over the total of autophagic
vesicles) the number of autolysosomes had actually decreased
in the ATN1-FL-65Q and ATN1-FL-26Q lines (Figure 2O).  This
contrasts with the initial
increase at 3 weeks of age in the
ATN1-FL-65Q, suggesting a change in the status of autophagy
with pathology progression. 
We also biochemically analyzed autophagy on a global scale. 
The extraction process separated a liquid supernatant from a
pellet fraction.  No changes were detected at 3 weeks of age
for GFP-LC3 and p62 in any brain area (Figure S3A).  Thus, the
mild autophagic ﬂux alterations observed at this stage are limited
Figure 1.  Behavioral Assessment of DRPLA Mice
(A–D) Grip strength analysis revealed the progression of degenerative decline in ATN1-FL-65Q mice (red) compared to wild-type mice (WT, black) and ATN1-FL26Q (blue) over time as measured by repeated-measures two-way ANOVA.  This was evidenced by signiﬁcant interaction between age (v1) and genotype (v2) (Xp <
0. 05,XXp < 0. 01, XXXp < 0. 001) when measuring both limbs (A and B).  Hereby the progression was stronger in males signiﬁed by stronger interaction in both limbs
(B) compared to females (A).  In addition, males showed progression when only forelimb grip strength was measured (D).  In contrast, females showed overall
decreased non-progressive grip strength levels for fore limbs (C).  Individual values are given as mean ± SEM and signiﬁcance levels for individual time points are
assigned above with *p < 0. 05, **p < 0. 01, and ***p < 0. 001. 
(E) Thigmotaxis as a measure of anxiety was evaluated for the ﬁrst 5 min after introduction to the open ﬁeld by assessing the time 10-week-old males and females
spent in the outer zone.  The ATN1-FL-65Q (65Q, red) line showed a signiﬁcantly higher tendency to remain close to the walls of the arena as compared to the wildtype (wt; black) and ATN1-FL-26Q (26Q; blue) mice.  Automatic quantiﬁcation using EthoVision 7XT software.  One-way ANOVA, **p < 0. 01. 
(F) General activity was assessed in females at 10 and 14 weeks evaluating the distance traveled from 5 to 25 min after introduction to the open ﬁeld.  ATN1-FL26Q (blue) mice were signiﬁcantly more active compared to the wild-type (WT; black) at 10 weeks.  This difference was more pronounced at 14 weeks of age with
both the ATN1-FL-26Q and ATN1-FL-65Q (red) lines being more active than the wild-type, while ATN1-FL-65Q mice were less active than ATN1-FL-26Q.  An
interaction with age was not observed (repeated-measures two-way ANOVA, v1, genotype; v2, age).  Automatic quantiﬁcation using EthoVision 7XT software. 
One-way ANOVA *p < 0. 05, **p < 0. 01, and ***p < 0. 001. 
(G) In gait analysis at 18 weeks of age, ATN1-FL-26Q shows a typical coordinated and regular footprint placing the hind paws (red) close to front paws (blue).  In
contrast, ATN1-FL-65Q shows an uncoordinated pattern typical for ataxia.

there was a signiﬁcant downregulation of
to the DN of DRPLA mice.  However, pronounced global defects
become apparent at the symptomatic stage.  In the 14 weeks
cerebellum,Atg5-12 conjugate formation and of the GFP-LC3-II/-I ratio (Figures 3A–3C), as well as of GFP-LC3-II (Figures S3C and S3D) in
ATN1-FL-65Q in the supernatant fraction, which was accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase in the cleaved GFP/GFP-LC3 ratio
and of the levels of p62 in the pellet (Figures 3D–3F).  These
changes were also maintained at end-stage (Figure 3G). 
A similar, albeit somewhat delayed, effect to that in the cerebellum was visible in the brainstem lysates of the ATN1-FL65Q line (Figures S3E–S3K).  The ATN1-FL-26Q line appeared
comparable to WT, except for a decrease in the cleaved GFP/
GFP-LC3 ratio at 14 weeks of age (Figures S3I and S3J).  Finally,
no autophagy alteration was detected in the forebrain at any time
point (Figure S3L). 
Despite robust similarities indicating block at lysosomal level
as observed in Drosophila DRPLA models, in DRPLA mice we
detected additional events that indicate the presence of feedback inhibition on autophagy signaling. 
The alterations in the cerebellum at the symptomatic stage
of 14 weeks are consistent with a block in autophagic clearance, combined with a reduction in signaling required for the
formation of new autophagosomes, perhaps result of a feedback loop.  In agreement with this, we detected a reduction
in phosphorylation of Atg13 on S318 (Figure S4A) and a significant decrease in mRNA and protein levels of Tfeb (Figures
3H–3J), the master regulator of the autophagosome-lysosome
system [19].  The feedback loop did not appear to be mediated
by activation of mTOR, which displayed rather a trend toward
inactivation, as shown by phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase
(Figure S4A).  The repression of Tfeb in ATN1-FL-65Q mice is
also indicated by absence from the nucleus of DN neurons
(Figure S4B), and decreased transcription of at least two of
its target genes (Figure 3K).  The ATN1-FL-26Q line showed
almost no difference from WT with the exception of a mild
reduction in the GFP-LC3-II/-I ratio (Figures 3A and 3B) and
GFP-LC3-II (Figures S3I and S3J) at 14 weeks in the cerebellum, as well as a tendency to reduction in mTOR signaling
(Figure S4A). 
To validate whether the stall in autophagy signaling in DRPLA
is present also in human cells, we used ﬁbroblast lines from two
DRPLA patients.  The human ﬁbroblasts failed to respond to
acute 6-hr treatment with the autophagy inducer Rapamycin
(Rap) or with the autophagy clearance blocker Baﬁlomycin A1
(BafA1), whereas a control ﬁbroblast line displayed the typical
increase in LC3I to LC3II conversion, upon Rap treatment, as
well as increased accumulation of LC3II, upon treatment with
BafA1 (Figure 3L).  Chronic 24-hr treatment with BafA1 elicited
a modest but reproducible response from the DRPLA human ﬁbroblasts, including signiﬁcant reduction in LC3I/II conversion
and accumulation of p62 (Figures S4C–S4G), suggesting a
block in autophagosomal biogenesis.  We further conﬁrmed
the block in autophagosome formation in DRPLA cells
with the tandem reporter RFP-GFP-LC3B (Figures 3M and
3N).  The ratio between RFP+ and RFP+/GFP+ positive puncta
in DRPLA cells did not increase with starvation and was also
not affected by additional treatment with BafA1, suggesting
also impaired progression and clearance of the few autophagosomes present (Figure S4H).  Thus, patients’ cells display the
same phenotype detected at late stages in the progression of
cellular pathology in DRPLA mice, i. e. , canonical autophagy
signaling, the formation of new autophagosomes, and their
clearance are stalled.

Nuclear Degeneration through Nucleophagy-Based
Cytoplasmic Displacement of LaminB1 following Block
in Canonical Autophagy
In parallel with autophagy stalling, we detected prominent nuclear pathology in DRPLA mice.  In DN neurons, there was a striking accumulation of p62 inside the nucleus of the ATN1-FL-65Q
mice with the formation of a large inclusion (Figure 6Aiii), which
appeared to be composed of smaller aggregates at end-stage
(Figure S5A).  The abnormal nuclear accumulation of p62 suggests a speciﬁc pathological defect in the nucleus.  TEM analysis
of DN neurons revealed that at end-stage these cells have a strikingly deformed nucleus (Figure 4A; see also Figure 6Ai), with
parts bulging out, especially those rich in heterochromatin, and
with the appearance of vacuolar-like structures at the periphery. 
Reviewing previous TEM data, we noticed that nuclear deformation was also present in Drosophila DRPLA models and fat mutants [14, 15].  Indeed, also in the Drosophila central brain, the
normal circular organization of LaminB in the cortex of neuronal
nuclei is signiﬁcantly altered and irregular in aged DRPLA ﬂies,
with some cells showing rufﬂes and gaps (Figures 4B and 4C). 
Most interestingly, human control ﬁbroblasts lose the normal
LaminB1 organization and display inward rufﬂes of the lamin
layer when treated with BafA1 for 48 hr (Figure 4D).  DRPLA ﬁbroblasts also display LaminB1 inward rufﬂes when treated with
BafA1 and, remarkably, also when treated with Rap for 48 hr (Figure 4D).  In addition, whereas both control and DRPLA cells
reduce their nuclear size when treated with Rap and BafA1 (Figure 4E), only control ﬁbroblasts increase the roundness of their
nucleus, opposite to DRPLA ﬁbroblasts (Figure 4F).  This indicates that human DRPLA cells respond differently than control
cells to Rap and BafA1 and that chronic blockage of the autophagy-lysosome clearance by BafA1 makes control and patient
cells converge toward parameters characteristic of DRPLA
nuclei (Figure 4G). 
Next, we have tested nuclear shape dynamics in ﬁbroblasts
from Vici syndrome (VS) patients.  VS is an early-onset infantile
multisystem disorder with well-characterized autolysosomal
blockage due to mutations in the EPG5 gene [20, 21], which is
required for the autophagosome-lysosome fusion [22].  VS ﬁbroblasts displayed similar nuclear shape dynamics as the DRPLA
ﬁbroblasts upon 48-hr BafA1 treatment (Figures S5B and S5C). 
Interestingly, the age-matched (3 years old) control cells were
hardly affected by this treatment, in contrast to the age-matched
(51 years old) DRPLA controls, probably reﬂecting different
resistance and plasticity, due to the age difference. 
Furthermore, in human neuroblastoma cells SK-N-BE(2) transfected with mCherry-LaminB1, genetic block of autophagy by
Atg6 small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased the roundness of
the nucleus (Figures S5D and S5E).  A similar trend was displayed
after Atg5 knockdown. 
We therefore reasoned that defects in nuclear shape dynamics may be linked to the recently reported role of autophagy
Figure 3.  Inhibition of Autophagy Flux at Lysosomal Level and Decrease in Autophagy Initiation Signaling in DRPLA
(A–C) The ratio of LC3II to LC3I was used to quantify autophagic ﬂux in western blot analysis of full-length GFP-LC3 in the supernatant fraction of cerebellar
lysates at 14 weeks of age (A).  The anti-LC3 antibody recognizes a doublet between 35 and 55 kDa (Figure S4B), consistent with GFP-LC3-I (upper) and cleaved
GFP-LC3-II (lower).  The level of Atg5-12 conjugate was used to quantify the events of autophagy initiation.  Densitometric analysis shows a decreased relative
abundance of cleaved GFP-LC3-II to full-length GFP-LC3-I (B) in ATN1-FL-65Q;GFP-LC3 (65Q) mice compared to ATN1-FL-26Q;GFP-LC3 (26Q) and WT;GFPLC3 (wt) mice.  Atg5-12 conjugate (C) is also decreased in ATN1-FL-65Q;GFP-LC3 (65Q) compared to WT;GFP-LC3 (wt).  Student’s t test, mean ± SEM, **p < 0. 01,
*p < 0. 05. 
(D–F) The accumulation of GFP cleavage product and autophagy receptor p62 was analyzed as a measure of autophagy ﬂux blockage in western blot assay of the
cerebellar lysates at 14 weeks of age (D).  Mouse anti-GFP antibody recognizes only GFP-LC3-II (Figure S4B) and cleaved GFP after longer exposure.  *Shorter
exposure of anti-GFP signal.  Densitometric analysis of the relative abundance of cleaved GFP to GFP-LC3-II (E) as well as the abundance of p62 relative to
a-tubulin (F) in WT;GFP-LC3 mice (wt), ATN1-FL-26Q;GFP-LC3 (26Q) and ATN1-FL-65Q;GFP-LC3 (65Q) mice.  Student’s t test, mean ± SEM, *p < 0. 05. 
(G) Accordingly, western blot analysis of autophagy shows a stall in autophagy ﬂux in end-stage ATN1-FL-65Q mice compared to wild-type (WT) as evidenced by
relative decrease of GFP-LC3-II as well as increase of p62 in the pellet fraction.  *Anti-p62 antibody revealed an additional band 20 kDa above the expected band
at around 60 kDa in the supernatant fractions of the cerebellum in end-stage mice.

(3 weeks) and early symptomatic (10 weeks) time points.  Relative levels normalized to b-actin and Hprt1 are given as a fold change of wild-type.  Two-way ANOVA,

0. 05, **p < 0. 01, ***p < 0. 001. 
(L) Whole-cell lysates of human ﬁbroblasts from healthy control and DRPLA patients were subjected to western blot analysis for endogenous LC3-I and LC3-II as
well as p62.  Induction of autophagy with Rap and block with BafA1 for 6 hr resulted in increase of LC3II compared to DMSO in control ﬁbroblasts, while there was
no acute response observed in DRPLA patient samples.  No changes in p62 levels were evident after 6 hr acute treatment. 
(M and N) Analysis of the autophagy ﬂux in control and DRPLA ﬁbroblasts (DRPLA 17) transfected with the tandem RFP-GFP-LC3B reporter.  Starvation in Hank’s
balanced salt solution (HBSS) medium was used to induce autophagy, BafA1 treatment to inhibit lysosomal degradation.  Autophagosomes are marked by yellow
signal as a result of combined RFP and GFP double ﬂuorescence.  Due to quenching of the GFP signal in acidic environment autolysosomes show RFP ﬂuorescence only.  Representative images acquired with Nikon spinning disc confocal microscope display a greater amount of autophagosomes and autolysosomes
in control ﬁbroblasts compared to DRPLA after starvation in HBSS for 3 hr (M).  Quantiﬁcation in (N) demonstrates a signiﬁcant increase in both autophagosomes
and autolysosomes in control but not in DRPLA cells after starvation.  Addition of BafA1 to starvation medium resulted in a greater number of GFP+RFP+ puncta as
compared to starvation only in control cells.  No changes were signiﬁcant in DRPLA patient ﬁbroblasts (see also Figure S6H).  Signiﬁcance values in the columns

in the degradation of nuclear lamina [8] and have analyzed
LaminB1 interaction with the autophagy machinery.  In DN neurons, LaminB1 is distributed in speckles of puncta throughout
the nucleus.  In ATN1-FL-65Q mice, we detected a signiﬁcant
accumulation of larger LaminB1 dots in the cytoplasm (Figures
5A and 5B), which was one of the earliest cellular phenotypes detected at 3 weeks in these mice (Figures S7E and S7H).  At endstage, many of the LaminB1 puncta co-localized with GFP-LC3
(Figures 5A, 5C, and S6A) in particular in the ATN1-FL-65Q line
(Figure 5C).  While some of the brighter dots localize in close
proximity or co-localize directly with p62, also in WT and
ATN1-FL-26Q lines, the majority displayed a segregated distribution (Figure S5A).  In particular, many more puncta were detected in ATN1-FL-65Q mice, but there was no overall overlap
with the intranuclear p62 inclusion (Figure S5A).  In contrast,
many LaminB1 puncta co-localized with polyQ protein aggregates, mostly inside the nucleus, but also in the cytoplasm in
DN neurons (Figure 5D) and Purkinje and granule cells (Figure S6B).  Despite the reduced number of polyQ dots in WT
and ATN1-FL-26Q lines, some co-localization could be
observed also in these cases (Figures S6B and S6C).  In granule
cells, ATN1-FL-65Q induced complete disorganization of nuclear LaminB1 at end-stage (Figure S6B), whereas at 3 weeks
only early signs of incomplete circular organization were detectable (Figure S6C).  Interestingly, overexpression of ATN1-FL-26Q
at end-stage was sufﬁcient
to induce a disorganization of
LaminB1 in some cells (e. g. , granule cells, Figure S6B), but not
in others (e. g. , DN neurons). 
Neuronal cell degeneration in the ATN1-FL-65Q mice correlates
with the increased localization of LaminB1 into the cytoplasm
early on.  This likely relates to the disruption of the nuclear shape
(Figure 5A), the severe alterations in DNA and chromatin appearance (Figure S6E) and the increased levels of gH2AX (Figures S6F
and S6G), a marker of senescence and DNA damage [23]. 
We used human DRPLA ﬁbroblasts for further functional analysis.  Here, we also detected a signiﬁcantly higher number of

cytoplasmic LaminB1 puncta after 48 hr (Figures 5E and 5F). 
Block of lysosomal clearance with BafA1 strikingly augmented
cytoplasmic LaminB1, overpowering any difference between
DRPLA and control ﬁbroblasts.  Longer culturing for 72 hr led to
an overall
increase in cytoplasmic LaminB1 eliminating the
difference between control and DRPLA ﬁbroblasts, potentially
masked by disappearance of more severely affected DRPLA
cells.  However, 72-hr Rap treatment had an extraordinary effect
in DRPLA ﬁbroblasts (not seen in control cells) on the accumulation of cytoplasmic LaminB1 (Figures 5E and 5F).  Interestingly,
BafA1 treatment had a progressive effect on cell death with control ﬁbroblasts displaying a signiﬁcant reduction in cell number
only after 72 hr (Figure 5F), whereas DRPLA ﬁbroblasts displayed
3634 Current Biology 27, 3626–3642, December 4, 2017
a signiﬁcant decrease in cell number already at 48 hr (Figure 5F)
probably due to exacerbation of an already present blockage in
the autophagy-lysosome clearance. 
Overall, these data in mice and human cells suggest that a stall
in canonical autophagy triggers an accumulation of LaminB1 in
the cytoplasm, which correlates with nuclear degeneration in
DRPLA mice and cell death in human ﬁbroblasts. 
Degradation and Excretion of Cytoplasmic LaminB1
during Cell Degeneration
In Ras-induced cancer models, nucleophagy has been shown to
result in the lysosomal degradation of LaminB1 through autophagy [8].  However, given the stall in autophagy in DRPLA or
Current Biology 27, 3626–3642, December 4, 2017 3635
(legend on next page)
following BafA1 treatment, we reasoned that alternative clearance routes may be employed for the LaminB1 accumulated in
the cytoplasm. 
TEM investigation of ATN1-FL-65Q DN cells also suggests
that alternative routes to canonical autophagy may be active in
DRPLA.  Remarkable perinuclear membranous accumulation
(Figure 6A), which surrounded cytoplasmic components enriched with electron dense spots (Figure 6Aii).  Similar structures
have been referred to as aggresomes [24], which are formed
close to the nucleus upon strong autophagy induction in
association with p62 and LC3.  Indeed, some DN cells formed a
perinuclear p62- and GFP-LC3-positive structure (Figure 6Aiii). 
A general disorganization of intracellular membranes in the
ATN1-FL-65Q cells was observed (Figures 2D–2F), also in the
distal cytoplasmic regions, where long phagophore-like structures were formed (Figure 6B).  Given the abnormal membrane
organization, we reasoned that endoplasmatic reticulum (ER)
stress could have been induced, also known to induce autophagy [25].  Bip and Chop are ER-stress-responsive genes that
are known to be regulated by all three pathways, Bip predominantly by the ATF6 pathway and Chop predominantly by the
PERK pathway.  The splicing of the mRNA encoded by the
Xbp1 gene is selectively regulated by the IRE1 pathway.  We
ﬁnd a signiﬁcant increase of Bip but not spliced Xbp1 and
Chop mRNAs in the ATN1-FL-65Q mouse line at pre-symptomatic stages (Figure S7A), but this is not sustained at early symptomatic stages, with the proapoptotic Chop being signiﬁcantly
downregulated (Figure S7B). 
We then analyzed at end-stage the other major source of intracellular membranes, the Golgi apparatus, reported to participate
in autophagy [26, 27] also as non-canonical Golgi membraneassociated degradation (GOMED) in Atg5- and 7-deﬁcient cells
[28, 29].  Relatively large double-membrane vesicular structures,
in some cases rather complex with vesicles apparently enclosed
in each other (Figure 6C) were evident in the ATN1-FL-65Q line. 
In addition, the Golgi marker GM130 localized in enlarged tubular
structures in the ATN1-FL-65Q DN cells at end-stage, in close
proximity to GFP-LC3 puncta (Figure 6D).  The whole GM130
compartment displayed an increase in size in end-stage ATN1FL-65Q DN cells compared to ATN1-FL-26Q and a similar trend
toward WT, with a signiﬁcant shift in the cell distribution toward
larger Golgi size (Figures 6E and S7C).  This phenotype was not
seen at an earlier stage (Figures S7E and S7F); however, the
Golgi was signiﬁcantly, albeit only transiently, more fragmented
at 3 weeks in ATN1-FL-26Q and ATN1-FL-65Q mice (Figures
S7D, S7E, and S7G).  Golgi fragmentation has been associated
with induction of non-canonical autophagy [30]. 
These data indicate an evolution of Golgi pathology from early
stages in DRPLA mice.  To assess the mechanistic role of the
Golgi in the accumulation of cytoplasmic LaminB1, we treated
human DRPLA ﬁbroblasts with Brefeldin A (BrefA), which compromises Golgi integrity and function [31].  BrefA treatment per
se induced dramatic LaminB1 cytoplasmic accumulation in
DRPLA ﬁbroblasts, synergistic to the previously described
BafA1 effect (Figures 6F and 6G).  Morphologically, in comparison to BafA1, BrefA induced the formation of larger LaminB1
puncta in a circular perinuclear pattern (Figure 6F), suggestive
of an organization around cellular organelles rather than diffused
cytoplasmic spreading.  As in DRPLA, EPG5-deﬁcient VS cells
displayed a signiﬁcant increase in the accumulation of LaminB1
in the cytoplasm with respect to controls in control conditions, as
well as under a number of treatments (Figures S7I and S7J). 
Importantly, a synergic effect of BafA1 with BrefA was observed,
while no synergy was displayed between BafA1and Rap. 
Overall, these data indicate that the Golgi is involved in the
degradation of cytoplasmic LaminB1, through a separate mechanism from that of canonical autophago-lysosomal digestion. these characteristics are shared by the recently
described GOMED pathway [29]. 
However, we ﬁnd that not all LaminB1 that localizes to the
cytoplasm is degraded.  In DRPLA ﬁbroblasts, cells rich in cytoplasmic LaminB1 puncta excrete small bodies containing
LaminB1 and p62 (Figure 7A).  SK-N-BE(2) human neuroblastoma
cells, co-transfected with constructs encoding cytoplasmic
EGFP and an mCherry-LaminB1 chimeric protein, display similar
signiﬁcant increase in cytoplasmic LaminB1 upon BafA1 treatment (Figures S7K and S7L).  In these cells, we were able to visualize LaminB1 exit from the nucleus, trafﬁcking to the cell surface

and expulsion from the cytoplasm (Figure 7B; Movie S3).  In this
slow excretion process, the LaminB1-containing buds appear
to remain in close proximity of the cell for prolonged time after
expulsion from the cytoplasm, suggesting a link may be retained
(Movie S3).  Most interestingly, co-transfection of siRNA against
key autophagy genes Atg5 and Atg6 increases the excretion of
LaminB1 in these cells (Figure 7C).  We subsequently analyzed
the culture medium of DRPLA ﬁbroblasts, using ultracentrifugation to further characterize the excretion products.  LaminB1 in
the medium (and in the cytoplasm) appears as a fragment (Figure 7D), possibly resulting from proteolysis of the full-length
LaminB1 upon exit from the nucleus.  The excreted LaminB1 fragment also speciﬁcally accumulates in the 100,000 3 g fraction
upon ultracentrifugation (Figure S7M), which is known to be enriched in microvescicles and exosomes but not apoptotic bodies. 
Treatment with BafA1 and BrefA, which signiﬁcantly increases
the amount of LaminB1 in the cytoplasm (Figures 7D and 7E),
also facilitates a dramatic increase in LaminB1 and p62 in the
culture medium (Figures 7D–7G).  BrefA treatment, in combination with BafA1, did not impair signiﬁcantly the excretion of
LaminB1 or p62 (Figure 7F). 
Taken together, these data indicate that autophagy inhibition
and Golgi
impairment increase the amount of LaminB1 and
p62 excreted in buds, which share many characteristics of
microvesicles. 
In neuroblastoma cells in culture, mCherry-LaminB1 puncta
can be found inside neighboring non-transfected cells, where
they often localize in the perinuclear areas (Figure 7H), reminiscent of the p62 rich aggresome-like structures observed in
DRPLA mice (Figure 6A).  Thus, adjacent cells might mask the
shedding in the complexity of an in vivo model. 
In conclusion, our data indicate that LaminB1 and associated
proteins are exported from the nucleus and then excreted
through a mechanism likely to underlie nuclear and cellular atrophy and death upon chronic autophagy inhibition. 
<Conclusion> DISCUSSION. 
The ﬁnal stages of cell dysfunction and death in neurodegenerative diseases and the atrophy of brain tissue remain elusive in
most cases.  Recently, the nucleus has received much attention
as the organelle whose functionality is severely compromised in
aggregation-prone neurodegenerative diseases [1, 2].  Mutation
in genes encoding nuclear lamina constituents cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria [32, 33], an accelerated aging syndrome
and have been associated with autophagic degradation of nuclear components [5]. 
The failure of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases has
been extensively studied and proved to be of paramount importance in most cases [6].  Our laboratory has previously developed
DRPLA Drosophila models, in which we have reported defects in
autophagic clearance [14] and transcription of the fat cadherin
[15].  We have conﬁrmed these defects in DRPLA mice, including
transcription of all mouse Fat genes (data not shown).  Here, we
show accumulation of undigested autophagosomes and autolysosomes (visualized by TEM), as well as lipofuscin, p62, and GFP
cleavage product in the ATN1-FL-65Q mice, indicating insufﬁcient autophagic clearance.  Progressive accumulation of p62
in the nucleus acted as a faithful biomarker of cell pathology in
the different brain areas (data not shown).  However, differently
than in Drosophila, at the behavioral level we observed gender
dimorphism in DRPLA mice, with males being affected more
strongly.  Furthermore, we provide evidence of a signiﬁcant effect
in terms of activity and exploration due to overexpression of a
WT form of human ATN1, a possible gain of function effect,
which is absent in the 65Q version and in Drosophila models. 
This highlights the importance of the ATN1-FL-26Q line as an
additional control in our analysis, which is in accordance with
previous transcriptional analysis reporting 19% of gene expression changes in the ATN1-FL-26Q to be in common with the
ATN1-FL-65Q mice but not with a mouse models for Huntington’s disease [34].  Unsurprisingly, we observe several mild phenotypes in ATN1-FL-26Q mice, reﬂected in increased GFP-LC3
turnover in absence of p62 accumulation and in the reorganization of LaminB1 in the cerebellar cortex.  Signiﬁcant differences
between the two ATN1 lines, such as increased accumulation
of lipofuscin, of LC3 puncta at end-stage and cleaved GFP in
combination with decreased Tfeb expression and that of two
of its targets, however, demonstrate that the stall in canonical
autophagy ﬂux are solely attributed to the polyQ expansion in
the ATN1.  Golgi enlargement at end-stage,
increase in the
senescence marker gH2AX, nuclear shape alterations, and cytoplasmic LC3-associated accumulation of LaminB1 are all speciﬁc signs of alternative autophagy induction and subsequent

BafA1/BrefA treatment increase the amount of LaminB1 in the cytoplasmic fraction (D and E).  BafA1 increased signiﬁcantly the amount of LaminB1 (D and F) and
p62 (D and G) in the medium supernatant fraction collected after 100,000 3 g ultracentrifugation; addition of BrefA did not signiﬁcantly reduce the amount of
LaminB1 or p62 found in this fraction.  Note that the LaminB1 band in cytoplasmic and medium supernatant fraction runs at a lower molecular weight of 45 kDa

nuclear degeneration in ATN1-FL-65Q animals, absent in ATN1FL-26Q controls. 
The analysis of mouse models and human DRPLA cells has
additionally revealed that decreased autophagic degradation is
accompanied by alterations in canonical autophagy signaling,
which suggests a stall in the formation of new autophagosomes,
perhaps resulting from a negative feedback loop.  Whereas mTor
activity displays a tendency toward inhibition, and thus autophagy induction, the phosphorylation of Atg13 by ULK1, the formation of Atg5-12 conjugates, and the rate of LC3-I/II conversion
are all downregulated.  This is further compounded by downregulation of Tfeb and at least two of its direct targets.  Interestingly,
human TFEB has been shown to be involved in auto-regulatory
feedback loops in starvation-induced autophagy [35].  Human
DRPLA ﬁbroblasts also failed to induce formation and maturation
of autophagosomes following autophagy modulating treatment,
consistently with the recently reported defects in Beclin-1dependent autophagy induction [36]. 
In mice, however, the autophagy stall takes place after an
initial mild increase in autophagosomes and autolysosomes,
possibly driven also by the early moderate ER-stress and Golgi
fragmentation.  Altogether, our current ﬁndings in mice supportin which neuronal cells challenged by polyQ ATN1
show an overall attempt to induce autophagy but, later on,
shut down canonical autophagy signaling, possibly as a result
of the inability to progress toward clearance.  This suggests
that new autophagosomes are not formed through canonical
signaling at end-stage, and that the signiﬁcant accumulation of
GFP-LC3 puncta in post-mitotic neurons in vivo rather results
from lack of digestion and/or alternative routes, including nucleophagy.  Human DRPLA ﬁbroblasts in vitro do not display the
same accumulation of LC3 puncta, presumably because of cell
division and of
the reduced time window for cell-culture
observations. 
Recently, alternative autophagy routes, involving some variation of the canonical autophagy steps and signaling, have been
discovered, but their role in neurodegenerative diseases has
not been described yet. 
Here, we detected alternative clearance pathways in DRPLA
mice.  At end-stage, we observed formation of aggresome-like
structures and Golgi enlargement, both cellular correlates for
pathological
induction of alternative autophagy routes.  The
aggresomes have been proposed as a cellular pathway for
degradation of polyQ [37] and other aggregation-prone proteins
that escape canonical autophagy [38].  However, since DN neurons lack a proper microtubule organizing center (data not
shown), it is unclear whether these structures also meet the functional deﬁnition of aggresomes.  The Golgi apparatus, and its trafﬁcking with the ER, is disrupted in several examples of neurodegeneration.  However, ER-stress markers, in particular, Chop, are
downregulated at later stages in DRPLA, perhaps in an attempt
to protect cells from apoptotic responses [39] or as a consequence of lost membrane integrity, incompatible with any further
ER-stress induction.  Conversely, we provide here the ﬁrst in vivo
evidence for GOMED in an autophagy-challenged neuropathology.  The Golgi has been reported in vitro to engage specifically with autophagy in certain contexts [27, 40], to be a possible
source for autophagic membranes in yeast [26] and mammals
[41], and to localize in close proximity to phagophores [42]. 
The involvement of the Golgi
in autophagy is, thus, another
indication for extreme autophagy stress in the cerebellar nuclei
of DRPLA mice.  The downregulation of GFP-LC3II conversion
and formation of Golgi-associated autophagic structures in
DRPLA mice strikingly resemble the alternative autophagy
routes described in Atg5- and Atg7-defective cells and mice
[28, 29], consistent with a block in canonical autophagy also in
DRPLA models. 
We thus propose that, upon stalling of the canonical autophagy machinery, cells attempt to maintain homeostasis via
alternative routes like GOMED-like degradation and excretion. 
This, however, leads to irreversible damage, nuclear breakdown,
and to terminal cell atrophy and degeneration. 
Here, we report the ﬁrst in vivo evidence of a nucleophagybased mechanism in neurodegeneration, reﬂected in the association of nuclear LaminB1 with GFP-LC3 in the nucleus and in the
cytoplasm, the cytoplasmic accumulation of LaminB1, its degradation and excretion.  This process may be responsible for the
collapse of normal nuclear structure, which correlates with the
progressive accumulation of p62 in the nucleus and the increase
in DNA damage and senescence.  Because of the lack of substantial co-localization of the LaminB1 puncta with p62, we interpret the p62 accumulation in the nucleus, as a separate event,
which occurs either in parallel or as a consequence of the loss
of nuclear integrity, and constitutes a reliable biomarker for
cellular pathology (unpublished data).  TEM pictures revealed
irregular nuclear shapes and morphological changes of nuclear
membrane, which may be indications for instability of, and
leakage from, the nuclear envelope.  This was further backed
by the alteration of LaminB structure in both ﬂy and mouse
models for DRPLA and in human ﬁbroblasts from DRPLA and
VS patients, as well as in human neuroblastoma cells with inhibited autophagy.  The export to the cytoplasm of nuclear
LaminB1 is likely to underlie the severe defects in nuclear shape,
causing disruption of nuclear integrity, which can be sensibly
connected to large-scale transcriptional aberrations, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and terminal cell degeneration, all key
features of human neurodegeneration. 
We speculate that in normal cells a low degree of nucleophagy
and of LaminB1 excretion might be an attempt at maintaining
nuclear health by rejuvenating nuclear lamina and perhaps
disposing of other nuclear proteins through autophagy and
excretion.  In DRPLA, this may be an attempt to counteract the
effect of polyQ ATN1.  This protein has been reported to interact
with nuclear matrix components at discrete locations [43], and
we observe a striking co-localization between LaminB1 and
polyQ aggregates both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. 
Once LaminB1 is exported into the cytoplasm, it is cleaved
and degraded through two independent pathways, the autophagy-lysosome and GOMED-like systems.  A small portion is
excreted also in healthy cells.  However, when the canonical
autophagy-lysosome pathway is impaired,
the cytoplasmic
LaminB1 is increasingly channeled for excretion, together with
p62 in large microvesicles or exophers [44]. 
We hypothesize that this excretion process is a clearance
mechanism for the cell, alternative to lysosomal and Golgi-mediated degradation; however, with the potential consequence of
causing cell and tissue atrophy.  While the function of the basal
excretion of LaminB1-rich buds remains to be understood, the
Current Biology 27, 3626–3642, December 4, 2017 3639
exacerbated excretion under autophagy and Golgi impairment
represents a novel mechanism for cell atrophy and death.  In
absence of effective degradation and recycling of the basic components, this process depletes the cell of material, damaging its
nucleus and cytoplasm and leaving behind cell corpses with a
fragile nucleus and thin cytoplasmic layer.  In our experiments,
in vivo and in vitro, cytoplasmic accumulation and excretion of
LaminB1 correlated with an increase in cell death, misshapen
nuclei, and cell atrophy. 
The common factor underling this mechanism of cell atrophy
and death is a persistent block in autophagy.  Since chronic autophagy inhibition has been reported in an increasing number of
rare and common human neurodegenerative pathologies, the
mechanism here reported may therefore be of great relevance
in human disease.
