Psychosocial stressors such as being exposed to social evaluative
threat have repeatedly been shown to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which plays an important role linking stress
and inﬂammation.  Importantly, chronic exposure to stressful life circumstances is often accompanied by systemic low-grade inﬂammation
which constitutes an antecedent of stress-related disease (Rohleder,
2014), thus illustrating the importance of being able to cope eﬀectively
with everyday stress in order to anticipate adverse health outcomes.  In
light of these relationships, research has focused on coping styles or
traits to explain inter-individual diﬀerences in HPA axis regulation in
order to provide an explanatory approach for individual vulnerability
to pathophysiological consequences of repeated physiological stress
reactions. 
HPA axis activity during stress as characterized by a quick rise and
decline of glucocorticoid levels is thought to be adaptive in terms of
maintaining physiological stability when facing environmental demands.
