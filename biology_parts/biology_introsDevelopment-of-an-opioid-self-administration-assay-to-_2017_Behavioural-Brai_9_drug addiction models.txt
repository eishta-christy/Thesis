In recent years, opioids have become the second most commonly
initiated drug of abuse.  A study by the National Survey of Drug Use and
Health revealed that 12. 5 million Americans reported opioid abuse.  As a
consequence, the incidence of overdose is reaching alarming rates
across North America [1]. 
A major limiting factor in the ﬁght against opioid abuse is the
limited number of therapies currently available.  Despite the current
situation, there is no eﬀective medical treatment for this type of addiction.  Substitution therapies are the only options currently available,
consisting of a slow acting opioid such as methadone [2] or in some
cases a combination of partial agonists (buprenorphine) and antagonists
(naltrexone) [1].  Despite some success in controlling drug intake, these
therapies do not treat drug seeking directly and are often unsuccessful
[1], leading to a high rate of relapse.  Therefore, increasing eﬀorts are
being put toward the development of drug addiction models to study
the biological mechanism of substance abuse and to ﬁnd new treatment
options.  So far, rodents and non-human primates have been used almost
exclusively [3].
