Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly, characterized by a decline in
cognitive functions.  Sporadic AD (sAD; i. e. , late-onset AD), the most
frequent form of AD with an unknown etiology, presents early abnormalities in brain glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, thus
resulting in an insulin-resistant state in the brain, which has been
suggested to be related to etiological events in its pathogenesis [1,2]. 
Additionally, protein aggregates [3], mitochondrial dysfunctions [4],
oxidative stress [5], neuroinﬂammation [6], brain cholinergic deﬁcits
[7], and dysfunctions in adult neurogenesis [8–10] are among the main
features of
sAD.
