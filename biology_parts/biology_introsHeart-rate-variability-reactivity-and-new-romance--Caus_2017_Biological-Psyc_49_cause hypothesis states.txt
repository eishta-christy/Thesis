Beginning a new romantic relationship is often accompanied by a
barrage of emotional and physiological changes.  Individuals report
experiencing euphoria during the honeymoon period and exhibit differences in hormone and neurotransmitter levels (Marazziti, Akiskal,
Rossi, & Cassano, 1999; Marazziti & Canale, 2004), and brain activation
patterns (Aron Name, 2005).  Recent evidence points toward a link between autonomic reactivity and relationship formation, with new romantic relationships potentially buﬀering physiological reactivity to
negative emotions.  Speciﬁcally, diﬀerences in heart rate variability
(HRV) have been detected between single and newly-coupled individuals presented with emotional stimuli (Schneiderman, ZilbersteinKra, Leckman, & Feldman, 2011). 
HRV refers to the variation between successive heartbeat intervals
and is extracted through electrocardiography (ECG).  A variable heart
responds more readily to environmental cues and returns to baseline
more quickly.  The high frequency (HF) component of HRV (. 15–. 40 Hz)
primarily represents the inﬂuence of the parasympathetic nervous
system (Thayer, Åhs, Fredrikson, Sollers, & Wager, 2012) which is associated with vegetative and restorative functions.  Resting HRV refers
to a single measurement taken while the individual is at rest, whereas
HRV reactivity measures phasic changes in HRV in response to a
stressor. 
According to Porges’ (1995; 1998) polyvagal theory, the myelinated
branch of the vagus nerve exerts parasympathetic inﬂuence on the
heart and controls the social engagement system.  This social engagement system serves as the neurophysiological basis for courting behaviours associated with seduction and the control of facial expression,
vocalization, and head tilt.  This system communicates reproductive
availability and fosters proximity with potential romantic partners
(Porges, 1998).  In times of stress this system is depressed to allow for
the expression of the sympathetic nervous system’s ﬁght-or-ﬂight response.  HRV may therefore serve as an index of both the vagus nerve’s
parasympathetic inﬂuence on the heart and the activation of the social
engagement system.  Building on Porges’ theory, Schneiderman Name
(2011) found that, in comparison to single participants, individuals
who had recently begun new romantic relationships demonstrated
lower HRV reactivity in response to negative emotion-inducing videos. 
They postulated that HRV reactivity decreases during the process of
courting associated with new romantic relationships due to increased
activation of the social engagement system.

The ﬁrst purpose of the present study is to replicate key ﬁndings
reported by Schneiderman Name (2011).  A cohort of single women was
studied over a 6-month period.  The replication hypothesis asserts that
compared to participants who remained single over the 6-month followup, their newly-coupled counterparts will evidence (a) higher HRV
during an emotionally evocative negative ﬁlm clip and (b) lower HRV
reactivity, deﬁned as milder change in HRV from positive to negative
ﬁlm clips.  Schneiderman Name interpreted both ﬁndings as evidence for
love causing a “buﬀered stress response” to negative stimuli (p.  1318). 
However, given the cross-sectional nature of their methodology, assertions about cause cannot be claimed with certainty.  Thus, two
competing longitudinal hypotheses are posited to understand the relationship between HRV reactivity and relationship status:
1.  The consequence hypothesis asserts that newly-coupled individuals
will evidence a drop in HRV reactivity to emotion-evoking ﬁlm clips
as their relationship status changes from single to coupled, while
HRV for singles will remain unchanged. 
2.  The cause hypothesis states that single individuals with lower HRV
reactivity at baseline will be more likely to enter into a new romantic relationship over a 6-month follow-up interval.  Other variables associated with HRV reactivity and relationship formation
may serve as potential moderators including: resting HRV, attachment style, emotional distress, self-esteem, and body mass index.
