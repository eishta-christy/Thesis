https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 004Virtually all plastid (chloroplast) genomes are circular double-stranded DNA molecules, typically between 100 and 200 kb in size and encoding circa
80–250 genes.  Exceptions to this universal plastid
genome architecture are very few and include the
dinoﬂagellates, where genes are located on DNA
minicircles.  Here we report on the highly deviant
chloroplast genome of Cladophorales green algae,
which is entirely fragmented into hairpin chromosomes.  Short- and long-read high-throughput
sequencing of DNA and RNA demonstrated that
the chloroplast genes of Boodlea composita are
encoded on 1- to 7-kb DNA contigs with an exceptionally high GC content, each containing a long inverted repeat with one or two protein-coding genes
and conserved non-coding regions putatively
involved in replication and/or expression.  We propose that
these contigs correspond to linear
single-stranded DNA molecules that fold onto themselves to form hairpin chromosomes.  The Boodlea
chloroplast genes are highly divergent from their
corresponding orthologs, and display an alternative
genetic code.  The origin of this highly deviant chloroplast genome most likely occurred before the
emergence of the Cladophorales, and coincided
with an elevated transfer of chloroplast genes
to the nucleus.  A chloroplast genome thatcomposed only of linear DNA molecules is unprecedented among eukaryotes, and highlights unexpected variation in plastid genome architecture. 
INTRODUCTION
Photosynthetic eukaryotes possibly originated 1. 9 billion years
ago following an endosymbiotic event in which a heterotrophic
ancestor of the Archaeplastida engulfed a cyanobacterium that
became stably integrated and evolved into a membrane-bound
organelle, the plastid [1, 2].  Following this primary endosymbiosis, an intricate history of plastid acquisition via eukaryoteeukaryote endosymbioses resulted in the spread of plastids to
distantly related eukaryotic lineages [3]. 
Plastids have retained a reduced version of the genome inherited from their cyanobacterial ancestor.  A core set of genes
involved in the light reactions of photosynthesis, ATP generation,
and functions related to transcription and translation is typically
retained [4].  Many genes have been lost or transferred to the nuclear genome and, as a result, plastids are dependent on nuclear-encoded, plastid-targeted proteins for the maintenance
of essential biochemical pathways and other functions such as
genome replication, gene expression, and DNA repair [5].  Nearly
all plastid genomes consist of a single circular-mapping chromosome, typically between 100 and 200 kb and encoding circa
80–250 genes [4, 6].  Diversity in size, gene content, density,
and organization of plastid genomes among different eukaryotic
lineages [7–9] is by and large limited, especially when compared
to mitochondria. 
Whereas fragmented mitochondrial genomes evolved several
times independently during the evolution of eukaryotes [8, 10],
fragmented plastid genomes are only known in dinoﬂagellates
[11] and a single green algal species [12].  In peridinin-containing
dinoﬂagellates,
the chloroplast genome is fragmented into
DNA minicircles of 2–3 kb, most of which carry one gene only
[11, 13].  Larger minicircles of up to 12 kb have also been
described [14], as well as minicircles containing two genes [15]
and ‘‘empty’’ minicircles without genes [16].  The genes located
on these minicircles mostly encode key components of the major

plasmid-like DNA that has been observed
in the chloroplasts of several species
[29, 30].  These plasmid-like DNA molecules represent a low-molecular-weight
(LMW) DNA fraction, visible on agarose
gels of total DNA extracts (Figure 1D).  Pioneering work revealed that these structures are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
molecules of 1. 5–3. 0 kb that fold into a
hairpin conﬁguration and lack sequence
similarity to the nuclear DNA [31, 32]. the hairpin-like DNAs contain
putatively transcribed sequences with
similarity to chloroplast genes encoding
(psaB, psbB, psbC, and
subunits of photosystems I and II
psbF) [31]. 
Here we describe intriguing features of the plastid genome of
Cladophorales, focusing on Boodlea composita.  Through the
integration of different DNA sequencing methods, combined
with RNA sequencing, we found that chloroplast protein-coding
genes are highly expressed and encoded on 1- to 7-kb linear
ssDNA molecules.  Due to the widespread presence of inverted
repeats, these molecules fold into a hairpin conﬁguration.  A chloroplast genome that is composed only of linear DNA molecules is
unprecedented among eukaryotes, and highlights unexpected
variation in plastid genome architecture. 
<Middle> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. 
DNA and RNA Sequencing Data
Our reconstruction of the chloroplast genome of B.  composita is
based on different high-throughput DNA sequencing methods
(Figure S1; STAR Methods).  The choice of short-read DNA
sequencing of isolated intact chloroplasts (chloroplast-enriched
fraction) using Roche 454 technology was based on comparable
sequencing approaches in other plants and algae that successfully resulted in assembly of chloroplast genomes [25].  To overcome possible assembly artifacts in a hypothetical scenario of
an inﬂated chloroplast genome bloated by repetitive elements,
long-read sequencing ofDNA fraction using the Paciﬁc Biosciences Single-Molecule
Real-Time (SMRT) method was applied, whereas long-read
sequencing of the LMW DNA fraction allowed characterization
of the previously observed plasmid-like DNA in the chloroplast
[29, 30].  To allow comparison of the results of Boodlea with
the high-molecular-weight
photosynthetic complexes, including subunits of photosystems I
and II, the cytochrome b6f complex, and ATP synthase, as well
as rRNAs and a few tRNAs [11].  The only other alga with a fragmented chloroplast genome is the green alga Koshicola spirodelophila, but here the level of fragmentation is minor: the plastid
genome is divided into three large circular chromosomes totaling
385 kb, with a gene content comparable to other green algae
[12].  In addition, plastid minicircles that coexist with a conventional plastid genome have been observed in a few algae,
including dinoﬂagellates with haptophyte-derived plastids [17]
and the green alga Acetabularia [18, 19]. 
Although plastid genomes generally assemble as circularmapping DNAs, they can take multiple complex conformations
in vivo, including multigenomic, linear-branched structures with
discrete termini [20, 21].  The alveolate Chromera velia is the
only known alga with a linear-mapping plastid genome with telomeric arrangement [22], and is also atypical in that several core
photosynthesis genes are fragmented.  Linear plastid genomes,
however, may be more widespread, as several plastid genomes
currently do not map as a circle [23]. 
Currently, and in stark contrast to other algae [9, 24–26], little
is known about the gene content and structure of the chloroplast genome in the Cladophorales (Ulvophyceae), an ecologically important group of marine and freshwater green algae,
which includes several hundreds of species.  These macroscopic multicellular algae have giant, multinucleate cells containing numerous chloroplasts (Figures 1A–1C).  Most attempts
to amplify common chloroplast genes have failed [27], with only
one highly divergent rbcL sequence published thus far for
Chaetomorpha valida [28].  An atypical plastid genome in
the Cladophorales is suggested by the presence of abundant

other species of Cladophorales, we generated additional DNA
sequence data from nine other species using Illumina HiSeq 2000
technology.  Finally, two deep-coverage RNA-seq (sequencing)
libraries, a total-RNA library, and an mRNA library enriched for
nuclear transcripts were generated to conﬁrm the transcription
of genes and to inform whether genes are nuclear versus plastid
encoded. 
A Prodigious Chloroplast Genome with a Reduced
Gene Set
Assembly of the chloroplast-enriched DNA reads generated using Roche 454 technology did not result in a typical circular chloroplast genome.  Instead, 21 chloroplast protein-coding genes
were found on 58 short contigs (1,203–5,426 bp): atpA, atpB,
atpH, atpI, petA, petB, petD, psaA, psaB, psaC, psbA, psbB,
psbC, psbD, psbE, psbF, psbJ, psbK, psbL, psbT, and rbcL. 
All but the rbcL gene code for components of the major thylakoid
transmembrane protein complexes (ATP synthase, cytochrome
b6f, and photosystems I and II).  The contigs contained inverted
repeats at their termini and, despite high coverage by sequence
reads, could not be extended by iterative contig extension. 
Sequence similarity searches and a metagenomic binning
approach (distribution analysis of 4-mers) demonstrated that
the inverted repeats were also found on contigs with no
sequence similarity to known proteins, raising the number of
contigs of chloroplast origin to 136.  These contigs are further
referred to as ‘‘chloroplast 454 contigs. ’’ The length distribution
of the chloroplast 454 contigs was consistent with the size of the
LMW DNA fraction as estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis
of Boodlea genomic DNA (Figure 1D; Figures S6A and S6B). 
The failure to assemble a circular chloroplast genome might be
due to repetitive elements that impair the performance of shortread assemblers [33].  Inﬂated chloroplast genomes bloated by
repetitive elements have been documented in several green
algae [34–36].  To overcome assembly artifacts and close putative gaps in the chloroplast 454 contigs, we applied SMRT
sequencing to the HMW and LMW DNA fractions.  Only 22
HMW DNA reads (ca.  0. 044%) harbored protein-coding genes
commonly present in chloroplast genomes of Archaeplastida
(Figure 2A).  All but three of these genes (psbA, psbB, and
psbC, which likely correspond to carry-over LMW DNA) contained spliceosomal introns, were absent in the chloroplast 454
contigs, and revealed a high ratio between mapped mRNA and
total-RNA reads, altogether suggesting that they are encoded
in the nucleus (Figure S2A).  Conversely, 22 chloroplast genes
(that is, the 21 protein-coding genes identiﬁed in chloroplast
454 contigs as well as the 16S rRNA gene) were found in the
LMW DNA reads (Figure 2A).  An orthology-guided assembly,
where the chloroplast 454 contigs harboring protein-coding
genes guided the assembly of LMW DNA reads with sequence
similarity to chloroplast genes, resulted in 34 contigs between
1,179 and 6,925 bp in length, henceforth referred to as the ‘‘chloroplast genome’’ (Figure 2B; Table S1). 
Four contigs of the Boodlea chloroplast genome (contigs 10,
19, 32, and 33) display long palindromic sequences that include
full-length coding sequences (CDSs) and a less conserved tail
region (Figure 2B).  The remaining contigs have similar palindromic structures but appear to be not completely assembled. 
Such palindromes allow regions of the single-stranded LMW
DNA molecules to fold into hairpin-like secondary structures. 
Additional smaller inverted repeats were identiﬁed in many of
the contigs (Figure 2B), which may result in more complex secondary structures. 
Chloroplast 454 contigs could not be scaffolded with long
HMW DNA reads, nor did a hybrid assembly between chloroplast 454 contigs and long HMW DNA reads generate a circular
chloroplast genome (Figure S1; STAR Methods).  The LMW DNA
reads are concordant and consistent with the palindromic sequences of the assembled chloroplast genome, indicating that
the palindromes are not a result of assembly artifacts (Figure 3;
Table S1).  As a consequence, we conclude that the chloroplast
genome is not a single large molecule but that it is instead fragmented into several molecules in the LMW DNA. 
A chloroplast genome that is entirely fragmented into hairpin
chromosomes is in line with earlier observations of abundant
LMW DNA in chloroplasts of several species of Cladophorales
[29].  The hairpin conﬁguration of the chromosomes derived
from our sequence data corresponds to earlier data based on
electron microscopy, endo- and exonuclease digestion experiments, acridine orange staining, and denaturing gel electrophoresis [29, 32].  Fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern
blot hybridization indicated that these plasmid-like DNA molecules are present within the chloroplast only [30], supporting
the congruence between chloroplast 454 contigs and sequences from the LMW fraction (Figure 3; Figure S7A). 
The chloroplast genome contigs of Boodlea feature an exceptionally high GC content, ranging from 54% to 60% in the genecontaining contigs (average 57%) (Table S1).  These values are
concordant with the high density of the LMW fraction observed
in CsCl/bisbenzimide gradients [29], and also with sequence
data from cloned plasmids of Ernodesmis (51%–59% GC) [31]. 
Plastid genomes are generally AT rich and, in green algal species, GC content typically ranges between 26% and 43%
[9, 37].  GC-rich plastid genomes are very rare, but higher values
have been reported for the trebouxiophycean green algae Coccomyxa subellipsoidea, Paradoxia multiseta (both 51% GC), and
