Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) measures drug reward, especially the appetitive quality of a reward stimulus that drives the subject
to seek out environmental cues previously paired with a rewarding
substance.  A baseline preference for each conditioned stimulus or CS
(e. g.  environmental context) in the absence of a paired unconditioned
stimulus or US (e. g.  drug) is determined prior to conditioning.  For the
conditioning trials that follow, the US is paired with the initially nonpreferred CS, determined from a baseline preference assessment, according to a biased stimulus assignment procedure.  After conditioning,
a choice test is performed in which both previously conditioned contexts are presented in the absence of the US, and the subject is unrestricted so that it may move between each CS [1].
