Motor imagery is deﬁned as the mental execution of an action
without any physical movement or muscle activation [1].  Brain activity
patterns during motor imagery are similar to those during the corresponding physical execution; the primary motor cortex (M1), premotor
cortex, supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and basal ganglia are
activated during motor imagery [2–7].  In addition, many studies have
reported signiﬁcant improvement of motor skills in patients with stroke
as well as in healthy persons after motor imagery training [8–10].  Because force control is always needed to perform a motor activity, motor
imagery training must somehow act on the neural substrates of force
control.  Thus, understanding the detailed eﬀects of motor imagery on
the neural substrates of force control is important for developing a

better rehabilitative strategy involving motor imagery. 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method
used to assess human corticospinal excitability.  The increase in cortical
excitability is evidenced by an increase in motor evoked potential
(MEP) amplitude, and a reduction in the motor threshold of the stimulation [11,12].  Studies using TMS, which has good temporal resolution, have revealed increased corticospinal excitability during
imagination of target muscle contraction without actual contraction
[13–16].  Furthermore, Mizuguchi Name [17] reported that changes in
corticospinal excitability during such motor imagery were related to the
imagined force level.
