INTRODUCTION
The vast majority of bacterial diversity is found within phylumlevel
lineages that lack isolated representatives [1], commonly
referred to as ‘‘candidate phyla. ’’ Candidate phyla constitute at
least 103 out of approximately 142 widely recognized bacterial
phyla for which there is genomic representation [1–3]; 46% of
known bacterial phyla are clustered in the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR).  However, there remain many phylum-level bacterial
lineages that have no genomic representation and are not yet
formally recognized [4].  Genome-resolved metagenomic studies
offer unique and unprecedented insights into the biology of these
uncultured, poorly understood lineages and their biochemical
diversity [3–8].  In addition to revealing the environmentally and
economically important roles played by such bacteria, these
studies contribute greatly to our understanding of the distribution
of lifestyles across the tree of life.  For example, genomes from
members of the CPR suggest that they are metabolically sparse
and lack many biosynthetic pathways typically required for life,
presumably because these organisms are dependent on other
microbes for survival
[6, 9].  Candidate phyla genomes may
also reveal novel functional diversity, as phylogenetic diversity
is correlated with novel proteomic diversity and biological properties [10, 11]. 
Marine mammals are an ecologically important group of
animals harboring little-explored microbial communities.  Previous research has shown that bottlenose dolphins, in particular,
host a rich diversity of novel bacteria [12].  Nearly 70% of nearfull-length 16S rRNA genes from the dolphin microbiota were
novel in 2015 at the species level, and representatives from 25
bacterial phyla were present in the mouth alone.  Furthermore,
a surprising number of candidate phyla such as Gracilibacteria
(BD1-5/GN02), Modulibacteria (KSB3), and the Parcubacteria
(OD1) supergroup, which are unusual in mammal-associated environments, were found in the dolphin mouth [12].  Genomes from
such candidate phyla have nearly exclusively been retrieved
from non-host-associated environments, and thus it is unknown
how these bacteria adapt to a mammalian environment.  Interestingly, despite evidence that the marine mammal microbiota is
shaped by the sea, these bacteria were not detected in the adjacent seawater [12]. 
The vast majority of bacterial diversity is found within phylumlevel lineages that lack isolated representatives [1], commonly
referred to as ‘‘candidate phyla. ’’ Candidate phyla constitute at
least 103 out of approximately 142 widely recognized bacterial

marine mammals afford an unusual opportunity for studying
bacterial diversity.  Working under the hypothesis that novel
phylogenetic diversity correlates with novel functional diversity,

in this study we applied genome-resolved metagenomics to
investigate the diversity and functional potential of the dolphin
oral microbiome.  The results hint at the wealth of evolutionary
and biochemical diversity that remains uncharted within previously unexplored environments, including mammalian microbiomes, and will contribute to future comparative studies of
host-associated versus non-host-associated candidate phyla
bacteria. 
<Middle> RESULTS. 
Dolphin Oral Microbiota Composition and Structure
Swab samples were collected from the gingival sulcus of
healthy bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under the purview of the U. S.  Navy’s Marine Mammal Program in San Diego
Bay, California.  Samples from two dolphins were selected for
shotgun sequencing based on the ﬁndings of Bik Name [12],
which indicated that
these two samples (DolJOral78 and
DolZOral124) contained representatives from nine candidate
phyla at relative abundances of R0. 05% (Table S1).  Pairedend Illumina HiSeq reads were generated, ﬁltered, assembled,
and used to recover microbial genomes, as described in STAR
Methods. 
From >63 Gbp of ﬁltered paired-end sequences, we recovered
107 draft-quality genomes from 24 previously described
bacterial phyla and one circular genome from a candidate Saccharibacteria (TM7) phage (presented below).  These genomes
derived from 22 organisms afﬁliated with the candidate phyla
Absconditabacteria (SR1), Campbellbacteria (OD1), Cloacimonetes (WWE1), Delongbacteria, Fermentibacteria (Hyd24-12),
Gracilibacteria (BD1-5/GN02), Modulibacteria (KSB3), and Moranbacteria (OD1), and the Saccharibacteria (TM7) phylum. 
Phylum-level assignments (or lack thereof, as was the case for
three of our genomes) were determined by constructing a phylogeny based on an alignment of 15 concatenated ribosomal
proteins (Figure 1; Data S1; see STAR Methods).  Of note, we
were able to link a 16S rRNA gene sequence to a member of
the Delongbacteria phylum, which previously consisted of a single genome for which no 16S rRNA gene had been recovered [2]. 
Additionally, low-coverage (%33) archaeal genome fragments
were recovered from two members of the Woesearcheota
phylum.  Similar sequences have been recovered from hostassociated environments (see SILVA database [13–15]), such
as coral heads [16] and human skin [17], but were not originally
recognized as afﬁliated with the Woesearcheota phylum or
placed within a comprehensive phylogeny. 
Bacterial community composition and structure inferred
from the same DNA preparations differed depending on the
survey method: genome-resolved metagenomics (this study)
versus 16S rRNA gene ampliﬁcation [12] (Figure 2; Figure S1;
Table S1).  Notably, the 16S rRNA gene that was associated
with the highest-coverage genome in both samples (17% and
4% relative abundance in DolJOral78 and DolZOral124, respectively; Figure 2) was barely detected in the amplicon-based survey (not detected in DolJOral78; 0. 04% relative abundance in
DolZOral124).  This is surprising, because the PCR primers
match the assembled sequence perfectly, the GC content of
the gene is 58%, and it contains no unusual
insertions.  The
two genomes are from the same species of Actinobacteria (order
Micrococcales), and the GC content of the genome is 68%. 
Furthermore, members of the CPR were greatly under-detected
using the amplicon-based approach.  From the metagenomic assemblies, we detected 16 unique CPR species-level genomes,
some of which ranked among the highest-coverage genomes
recovered (Figure 2).  For example, the fourth most abundant
bacterial organism in the DolJOral78 sample was a member of
the Saccharibacteria phylum (4% relative abundance), although
no Saccharibacteria representatives were detected in the
DolJOral78 sample in the previous 16S rRNA gene amplicon survey.  In the amplicon-based study [12], only nine unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the CPR were identiﬁed
from both samples combined, with a maximum relative abundance of 0. 24%.  This discrepancy can be explained at least
partially by primer mismatches, consistent with previous reports
on the CPR [4].  Of the 21 unique CPR 16S rRNA genes assembled and identiﬁed in the metagenomic data, nine span the region between the commonly used 338F and 906R bacterial
primers (also used in Bik Name [12]) and have sufﬁcient read
coverage to validate the assembly.  Eight of these have 1–3 mismatches in at least one primer site.  In the amplicon study, eight
of the nine OTUs were detected among all samples, although
only the one OTU with no primer site mismatches was detected
in the two samples studied here. 
Given the breadth of novel bacterial diversity in the dolphin
oral samples, we next searched for novel phage diversity. 
Using a stringent set of criteria (see STAR Methods), we identiﬁed a set of 33 and 55 sequences from DolJOral78 and
DolZOral124, respectively, for which we had high conﬁdence
in their derivation from phage genomes.  These sequences
range in length from 1,583 to 119,885 bp (average 19,363
and 21,462; SD 13,243 and 19,615 bp).  To assess overlap
between samples, we performed a reciprocal best-hit BLAST
[18, 19] search between phage sequences from the two
samples.  We identiﬁed 14 phage genome fragments that
were present (or had close relatives present) in both samples. 
To evaluate the degree of phage genome novelty, we BLASTed
[18, 19] phage sequences against the NCBI non-redundant
nucleotide
(https://ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/nucleotide). 
Only three alignments were longer than 1,000 bp, the longest
of which was only 2,919 bp.  These alignments corresponded
to 2. 3%, 3. 8%, and 8. 2% of the lengths of the respective
phage scaffolds.  This suggests that phages in the dolphin
mouth are only distantly related to phages for which genomic
fragments have previously been recovered, as one would
expect under the hypothesis that novel bacterial diversity begets novel phage diversity.

Novel, Deeply Divergent Phylum-Level Lineages
The concatenated ribosomal protein tree enabled determination
of the phylum-level identity of recovered genomes (Figure 1). 
Within this tree, three genomes belonging to two deep-branching lineages eluded identiﬁcation.  To evaluate whether these
two lineages were representative of previously undescribed
phyla, we examined whether (1) they formed monophyletic lineages in both the concatenated ribosomal protein phylogeny and
the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, and (2) the 16S rRNA gene sequences of such lineages were at least 25% divergent from
those of known phyla (i. e. , the threshold used by Yarza Name [20]).

The maximum-likelihood tree includes representation from all genomes that contained R8 of 15 ribosomal proteins used to infer the phylogeny (with the
exception of one Delongbacteria genome with 7 ribosomal proteins) as well as from published genomes.  Bootstrap support values R50% are denoted with a
closed circle on the branches.  Branches of phyla with genomic representation in the dolphin mouth are color coded such that dark blue indicates candidate
phylum, light blue indicates other phylum, and red indicates novel, deep-branching lineage.  Labels for these phyla appear around the tree, with dotted lines
indicating the corresponding branch.  Numbers next to candidate phyla names indicate the number of genomes from each phylum that are publicly available in
NCBI databases prior to this study (purple), the number of those that come from an animal-associated environment (green), and the number that were recovered
in this study (orange).  Branches of the remaining phyla are included in the tree as references, are colored black, and can be identiﬁed using the legend at the
bottom of the ﬁgure.  The CPR is denoted with blue shadowing, and the FCB superphylum is denoted with green shadowing.  The topology of the tree with respect
to the position of the CPR does not recapitulate that of Hug Name [1], presumably due to lower sampling depth reducing the ability to resolve the branching order of
the deepest lineages.  See also Figures S1–S3, Table S1, and Data S1.

The top panel presents the community structure of the DolJOral78 sample, and the bottom panel presents that of the DolZOral124 sample.  Each symbol represents a bin, which is a set of scaffolds that share similar genomic signatures.  In most cases, bins represent of a genome (or fragments of a genome) from a single
organism.  Bins that contain multiple genomes from organisms with similar genomic signatures are denoted by a purple outline around the symbol.  The average
coverage of all scaffolds in a bin is represented on the y axis, and bins are ranked in order of decreasing average coverage on the x axis.  Due to the complexity of
the samples, not all low-coverage genomes could be binned.  This point, after which only a portion of genomes could be binned, is denoted by an arrow for
DolJOral78 and is not reached in the top 75 bins for DolZOral124.  See also Figure S1 and Table S1. One lineage, for which we propose the name ‘‘Delphibacteria’’
(rationale in Supplemental Discussion),
is afﬁliated with the
Fibrobacteres-Chlorobi-Bacteroidetes (FCB) superphylum and
is represented by genomes DolJOral78_Bacteria_63_78 and
DolZOral124_Bacteria_64_63.  The names refer, for example, to
sample DolZOral124,
taxonomic resolution Bacteria,
GC content of 64%, coverage of 633).  The 16S rRNA gene
sequence from the Delphibacteria lineage clusters with sequences from what is currently recognized as the Latescibacteria phylum in the SILVA database [13–15] (see Supplemental
Discussion, Figure S2, and Data S1).  The diversity encompassed
by this ‘‘phylum’’ was recently found to be an assemblage of at
least two phylum-level lineages: Latescibacteria and the newly
proposed Eisenbacteria [2].  Nearly all members of the Delphibacteria lineage share <75% sequence identity across the 16S
rRNA gene with members of the Eisenbacteria phylum (Figure S2A) and <78. 5% sequence identity with members of the
Latescibacteria phylum (Figure S2B).  Predicted proteins in the
near-complete genome from this lineage were most similar to
those from the Deltaproteobacteria phylum (Figure S3A). 
Notably, the Delphibacteria lineage was detected in 41 oral samples from 15 of 33 U. S.  Navy dolphins and one of ten wild dolphins surveyed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing
in Bik Name [12], although it was classiﬁed as a member of the
Latescibacteria phylum.  In the DolJOral78 sample, two Delphibacteria genomes were detected at relative abundances of
1. 6% and 1. 2%, while in the DolZOral124 sample one Delphibacteria genome was detected at a relative abundance of 0. 7%. 
The second previously uncharacterized lineage, for which we
propose the name ‘‘Fertabacteria’’ (rationale in Supplemental
Discussion), is afﬁliated with the CPR and is represented by
the genome DolZOral124_Bacteria_38_8.  The 16S rRNA gene
sequence from Fertabacteria clusters with sequences from
what is currently recognized as the Peregrinibacteria (PER)
phylum in the SILVA database (see Supplemental Discussion
and Data S1).  It is part of a well-supported clade with <75%
sequence identity to the rest of the PER phylum, including
PER-ii (Figure S2C).  Predicted proteins from this lineage are

most similar to those from the Peregrinibacteria phylum (Figure S3B), yet the 16S rRNA gene sequence identity argues
against its inclusion in this group.  Out of all samples surveyed
with 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing in Bik Name [12], only a single Fertabacteria amplicon was detected.  The amplicon was
generated from a sample of forcefully expired air (‘‘chuff’’) from
the dolphin respiratory tract collected on sterile ﬁlter paper,
and was originally classiﬁed as a member of the Gracilibacteria
phylum.  The 906R primer used in Bik Name [12] had two mismatches to the corresponding priming site, and therefore this
organism may have been widely under-detected in the amplicon-based survey.  The Fertabacteria genome is one of the
lowest-coverage genomes (83) in this study, with a relative
abundance of 0. 09% in the DolZOral124 sample. 
Functional Proﬁle of the Delphibacteria Lineage
Due to the abundance and prevalence of Delphibacteria organisms in the dolphin oral samples, we investigated the metabolic
potential of
the near-complete DolZOral124_Bacteria_64_63
genome.  The genome dataset contained 49 of 51 universal bacterial single-copy genes used to assess completeness [21]. 
It comprised 3,362,850 bp and is predicted to contain 3,011 protein-coding genes.  It appears to utilize a variety of compounds as
carbon and energy sources, including polysaccharides such as
starch/glycogen, acetate, acetaldehyde, ethanol, and butyrate
(Figure 3; Data S2).  DolZOral124_Bacteria_64_63 carries the
potential to ferment to acetate, with ethanol and acetaldehyde
3756 Current Biology 27, 3752–3762, December 18, 2017
being produced during regeneration of NAD+ required for glycolysis.  Two of the three genes speciﬁc to gluconeogenesis are also
present, as are those involved in the non-oxidative pentose
phosphate pathway.  The genome includes the capacity for
amylose synthesis and possibly GDP-L-rhamnose synthesis. 
The complete gene complement required for running the
forward tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is present.  Accordingly,
the DolZOral124_Bacteria_64_63 genome is predicted to
support aerobic respiration and possibly also anaerobic respiration using nitrogen compounds as terminal electron acceptors.  The catalytic subunit of a periplasmic nitrate reductase
was detected (napA), as were accessory periplasmic nitrate
reductase subunits.  The catalytic subunit of a nitric oxide
reductase (norB) and the terminal nitrous oxide reductase
(nosZ) were also detected.  Nitrite reductase genes (nirK
or nirS) were not identiﬁed, nor were many of the subunits
typically associated with the above reductases.  Nonetheless,
the presence of catalytic subunits for three out of the four
steps involved in converting nitrate to dinitrogen suggests
that this Delphibacteria representative is capable of denitriﬁcation.  We detected another mechanism for generating proton
motive force in the form of a pumping pyrophosphatase,
indicating that DolZOral124_Bacteria_64_63 may be able
to utilize pyrophosphate as an alternative chemical energy
carrier to ATP. 
DolZOral124_Bacteria_64_63 is most likely a lipopolysaccharide-producing bacterial species with ﬂagella and type IV pili andB

region are color coded by function: red, transposase or integrase; gray, unknown function; green, non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPS); blue, other; and

domain; PCP, peptide carrier protein domain; nMT, N-methylation domain; and TE, thioesterase domain.  Each of the 17 adenylation domains encoded by NRP
synthesis genes is responsible for the recognition and activation of amino acids that will be incorporated into the peptide product.  The cumulative length of these
three genes is 69,771 bp. 
(B) Predicted structure of the peptide product.  The amino acid sequence of the predicted peptide was established based on three A domain substrate speciﬁcity
algorithms incorporated in antiSMASH [24–26].  Non-ribosomal peptide (NRP) was designated when no consensus was reached.  Underlined amino acids are
predicted to be in the D conﬁguration, due to the presence of a dedicated epimerization domain in their modules.  We cannot distinguish between the possibilities
of a circular or linear product.

capable of chemotaxis.  We identiﬁed ten acriﬂavin resistance
proteins, which are typically involved in efﬂux of cationic antimicrobial peptides.  Overall, we infer that this is a heterotrophic
organism that has the genomic potential for oxygen and most
likely nitrate reduction. 
given the large size of the BGC.  Based on the prominence of
this Actinobacterium in both dolphin oral microbiotas and the
size of this genomic region (3% of the genome), the peptide
product is likely to be advantageous to the organism, and may
facilitate interactions within the community and/or with the host. 
Large Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in the Dominant
Actinobacteria Genome
One of the two highest-coverage bins in both samples contained
scaffolds that nearly exclusively encoded genes that were part of
a small-molecule biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC).  The products
of BGCs are diverse and often act as mediators in bacteria-host
or bacteria-bacteria interactions [22, 23].  On ﬁrst inspection, the
BGC was not assigned to any draft-quality genomes from these
samples.  Extension of the BGC-associated scaffold revealed
that it is part of the genome of the most abundant species in
both samples (Actinobacteria phylum).  The BGC is located
within an 80,484-bp-long region of the genome ﬂanked by mobile elements and has a relatively high GC content (74% versus
68% for the rest of the genome) (Figure S4A) and a distinct tetranucleotide composition (Figure S4B).  Its read coverage is
consistent with the rest of the genome (Figure S4C).  These ﬁndings suggest that the BGC was acquired through a relatively
recent horizontal gene transfer event.  Notably, the BGC is predicted to produce a relatively long non-ribosomal peptide
(NRP) of 17 amino acids (Figure 4).  NRPs are synthesized by
NRP synthetase enzyme complexes, independent of the ribosome.  In the MIBiG database [27], the average size of NRPs
synthesized by BGCs is only 6 amino acids long (SD ±4. 5) (Figure S4D).  Because the BGC does not have signiﬁcant similarity
to known BGCs and its predicted product does not resemble
any known peptide, elucidation of the function of this BGC product will require heterologous expression—a daunting challenge
Novel Cas9 Diversity
Given the wealth of both novel bacterial and phage genomes, we
attempted to link phage sequences to bacterial hosts.  We
ﬁrst identiﬁed CRISPR-Cas systems and, in doing so, discovered surprising CRISPR-Cas9 diversity (see Supplemental
Discussion, Figure S5, and Data S3 and S4).  We identiﬁed a
total of 67 unique predicted Cas9 proteins (see STAR Methods). 
Interestingly, two are longer than all Cas9 protein sequences
in the RefSeq database [28]
(accessed December 2016)
(Figure 5A) (DolZOral124_scaffold_19676_2: 1,895 amino acids;
DolZOral124_scaffold_953_34: 1,794 amino acids).  Neither was
assigned to any of the recovered genomes.  Another Cas9 contains a large insertion in the RuvC-III domain (DolZOral124_
scaffold_26_62, also unassigned).  We aligned all three novel
Cas9 amino acid sequences against AnaCas9 from Actinomyces
naeslundii (Figure 5B).  AnaCas9 was selected as a reference
because it has a resolved crystal structure and it is a type II-C
Cas9, as are the three novel predicted proteins in the present
study (Figure S6; Data S1).  We found that the largest insertions
in the two long Cas9 proteins are concentrated in regions
that align with the a-helical, b-hairpin, and RuvC-III domains
of AnaCas9.  The DolZOral124_scaffold_26_62 Cas9 has a
304-amino acid insertion in the RuvC-III domain when compared
with AnaCas9.  This insertion has signiﬁcant homology (R30%
identity over 100% sequence length; e value < 1e-10) to seven
other Cas9 proteins in the NCBI non-redundant protein database
(https://www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/protein/).  Attempts to infer the

Discussion) [29, 30]. 
Saccharibacteria Type II CRISPR-Cas Systems and a
Saccharibacteria-Infecting Phage
CRISPR-Cas systems are exceedingly rare within the CPR.  In a
survey of 354 high-quality draft genomes from the CPR, Burstein
Name [31] found that only ﬁve genomes (1. 4%) contained a
CRISPR-Cas system, and none contained a type II system.  We
found complete type II CRISPR-Cas systems in two out of ﬁve
Saccharibacteria (CPR) genomes (see Supplemental Discussion).  The Saccharibacteria genomes are not closely related to
each other; the ribosomal protein S3 sequences share 67%
amino acid identity, which is less than expected for genomes
in the same family [32].  Although the two complete Saccharibac3758 Current Biology 27, 3752–3762, December 18, 2017
teria Cas9 proteins are afﬁliated with a single clade of type II-C
Cas9 proteins (Figure S6), neither of the CRISPR-Cas loci encodes a Cas4 protein, as would be expected for a type II-CThe ability to identify phages that infect CPR bacteria is
important to understanding CPR bacterial evolution and the constraints that they face in their natural settings.  However, it is rare
to identify phages that infect the CPR [31, 33, 34].  Using
CRISPRFinder [35] and Crass [36], we identiﬁed a total of 42
unique spacers from Saccharibacteria CRISPR arrays (see Supplemental Discussion and Data S4).  Of the Saccharibacteria
spacers, only one (from the sole CRISPR array associated with
DolZOral124_Saccharibacteria_55_12_B) matched a genomic
fragment that was identiﬁable as a phage genome (DolZOral124_
Phage_53_65).  The phage and Saccharibacteria genomes were
originally binned together based on tetranucleotide frequency. 
Convergence of tetranucleotide frequency is suggestive of a history of co-evolution between a phage and its bacterial host [37]. 
The phage genome is circular and 38,841 bp long, with a GC
content of 52%.  No read pairs mapped to both the phage and
Saccharibacteria genomes.  Consequently, we infer that the
phage was not integrated into the host genome at the time of
sampling.  The phage genome contains 50 predicted open
reading frames (ORFs) and no tRNAs (Figure 6; Data S5).  Predicted functions of these ORFs include host cell lysis, phage
packaging, and DNA recombination. 
<Conclusion> DISCUSSION. 
We used genome-resolved metagenomics to study the microbial communities of
two dolphin oral samples in order to
explore the unusual evolutionary and functional diversity predicted by a previous 16S rRNA gene-based survey [12].  Of
note, we detected and characterized novel
lineages distantly
related to and reproducibly unafﬁliated with known phyla.  We
propose that they represent phylum-level
lineages for which
we put forth the names Candidatus Delphibacteria and Candidatus Fertabacteria.  The Delphibacteria representative characterized here is predicted to denitrify, which is a process that
may impact dolphin health and physiology.  For example, in humans, denitriﬁcation by oral bacteria can affect oral and gastric
blood ﬂow, signaling in bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host
interactions, and mucus thickness in the stomach [38, 39].  It
is unclear whether bacteria in the Delphibacteria candidate
phylum remain uncultured due to intrinsic biological factors or
due to the absence of a systematic effort to culture and identify
them using traditional methods.  Regardless, our genomic analysis may provide insights into the conditions required for
successful cultivation of these and closely related bacteria,
especially with regard to oxygen conditions and potential energy and carbon sources. 
In addition, we recovered genomes from candidate phyla
whose members are seldom associated with animals.  These genomes will be a valuable resource for future comparative studies
aimed at understanding how such bacteria adapt to a mammalian environment.  Interestingly, we detected members of the
Saccharibacteria phylum.  Members of this phylum have been
associated with human oral disease [40].  At least one Saccharibacteria strain, an obligate endobiont of an Actinobacterium, has

frames (ORFs) around the genome, numbered from 1 to 50.  ORFs are color coded based on inferred property or function.  For those ORFs that have an inferred
property or function, green squares denote annotations supported by domain structure, blue circles denote annotations supported by a BLAST [18, 19]

the ability to modify human immune responses in vitro [9].  This
may aid Saccharibacteria and potentially also their microbial
host/s in avoiding clearance by the human immune system.  It
remains unclear whether oral Saccharibacteria are detrimental
to dolphin health, and whether they may be associated with
Actinobacteria in this setting. 
An interesting aspect of our community composition analysis
was that the highest-coverage genome was from an Actinobacterium that went virtually undetected in the previously published
16S rRNA amplicon survey.  The underlying reasons for this
discrepancy remain unknown.  This ﬁnding highlights the fact
that even among relatively well characterized phyla there exist
unexplored branches represented by organisms with unusual
predicted properties that are inherently distinct from the bacteria
we are accustomed to studying. 
By exploring the microbiology of the dolphin mouth, we
uncovered an unexpected diversity of CRISPR systems
that are related to those used in recently developed CRISPRCas9-based genome editing methods [41].  At this time, the
potential technological value of divergent proteins from class 2
CRISPR-Cas systems (those with single-subunit CRISPR RNA
(crRNA)-effector molecules) remains relatively unexplored and
so the signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings remains unclear.  However,
the ﬁndings further establish the potential importance of genes
discovered in the genomes of bacteria newly characterized by
cultivation-independent metagenomics [10]. 
Previously unexplored environments, such as the marine
mammal oral cavity, contain a wealth of phylogenetic and functional novelty of which we have only just scratched the surface.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Oral samples were obtained from the left gingival sulcus of dolphins managed by the U. S.  Navy Marine Mammal Program (MMP) in
San Diego, California.  The swabbing protocol adhered to the guidelines described in the CRC handbook of Marine Mammal Medicine.  From the 22 dolphin oral specimens included in Bik Name [12], two were selected for metagenomic analysis.  Sample DolJOral78
originated from a healthy 5-year-old male and sample DolZOral124 originated from a healthy 29-year-old lactating female.  The MMP
is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International and adheres to
the national standards of the United States Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the
Animal Welfare Act.  As required by the U. S.  Department of Defense, the MMP’s animal care and use program is routinely reviewed by
an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and by the U. S.  Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.  The animal use and
care protocol for MMP dolphins in support of this study was approved by the MMP’s IACUC and the Navy’s Bureau of Medicine and
Surgery (IACUC #92-2010, BUMED NRD-681). 
To compare the proportion of CRISPR-Cas types across oral environments from different mammals (see Supplemental Discussion
and Figure S5), we additionally analyzed data from two humans and a harbor seal.  Saliva samples were obtained from two healthy,
pregnant women who presented at Lucille Packard Children’s Hospital in Stanford, California.  These samples were collected from
subjects who signed a written consent, and following procedures described in an IRB protocol (21956) that was approved by an
Administrative Panel for the Protection of Human Subjects at Stanford University.  Swab samples from the left gingival sulcus of a
harbor seal were obtained from an animal originally admitted to the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, California, USA with pneumonia, malnutrition, and a left hind ﬂipper injury.  The animal was treated with Clavamox from July 5-18, 2012, recovered, and was
released back into the wild.  The sample used here was the last collected prior to release at a time of health, and was taken on
August 22, 2012 during a routine clinical exam.

METHOD DETAILS
DNA extraction, sequencing, and quality ﬁltering
We used the same DNA preparations from MMP dolphin gingival sulcus samples as used by Bik Name [12].  These samples were processed using the QIAamp Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA).  Library preparation and shotgun sequencing were performed by the Keck
Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Brieﬂy, short read Illumina libraries (2 3 250bp) were constructed using the
Kapa Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) and the two libraries were sequenced on a single Illumina HiSeq 2500 lane. 
The average gDNA fragment length was 580 bp (range: 350-800 bp).  93,369,641 raw read-pairs for sample DolJOral78
and 76,479,271 raw read-pairs for sample DolZOral124 were quality-ﬁltered using Sickle [66] with the ‘‘-q 28’’ ﬂag speciﬁed to increase the minimum threshold of acceptable quality scores.  Adapters were removed and anomalously short reads (< 100 bp)
were discarded in one step using SeqPrep (https://github. com/jstjohn/seqprep).  Reads that mapped to the dolphin genome (turTru2)
[43] were considered to be host contamination and were removed from the dataset using bowtie2 version 2. 2. 4 [50].  Six percent and
two percent of reads from the DolJOral78 and DolZOral124 samples mapped to the dolphin genome, respectively.  After host
sequence removal, 58,250,929 and 82,272,429 read-pairs were available for metagenome assembly. 
Metagenome assembly, annotation, and binning
Assembly of read-pairs from each sample was performed using IDBA-UD version 1. 1. 1 [56].  IDBA-UD was patched to increase the
maximum permissible length of paired end reads from 128 bp to 250 bp (via the kMaxShortSequence constant), thereby allowing for
the use of 250 bp reads with the ‘‘-r’’ option.  The DolJOral78 and DolZOral124 reads were assembled into 306,641 and 149,038 scaffolds greater than one kb in length, respectively.  Genes were predicted using the metagenome implementation of Prodigal version
2. 6. 0 [62].  USEARCH version 7. 0. 1 [69] was used to compare protein sequences from all predicted ORFs against the UniRef 90 [49]
and KEGG [44–46] databases, as well as an in-house database of predicted ORFs from candidate phyla genomes.  16S and 23S rRNA
genes were predicted using in-house HMM-based rRNA gene identiﬁcation scripts [4] and tRNA genes were predicted using tRNAscan version 1. 23 [68]. 
A bin is a set of scaffolds that share similar genomic features, and is typically representative of a genome.  Binning of scaffolds was
performed using ggKbase, based on %GC content, read coverage, and inferred taxonomy of scaffolds by best-hit annotations of
predicted proteins.  Bins were reﬁned on the basis of tetranucleotide frequency using emergent self-organizing maps (ESOM).  To
do so, tetranucleotide frequency was calculated for all scaffolds greater than or equal to ﬁve kb in length over window sizes of
ﬁve kb (as described in Dick Name [70]), and ESOMs were computed and visualized with the Databionics ESOM Tools software [53]. 
Identiﬁcation of phage scaffolds
To identify candidate phage sequences, we required that scaffolds have two or more gene annotations containing virus-speciﬁc keywords from the list: ‘‘capsid, phage, terminase, base plate, baseplate, prohead, virion, virus, viral, tape measure, tapemeasure neck,
tail, head, bacteriophage, prophage, portal, DNA packaging, T4, p22, holin’’ (excepting annotations with following terms: ‘‘abortive,
shock, forkhead, T7 exclusion, macrophage, hth-like transcriptional regulator, peptidase family t4, lamin a/c globular’’).  Candidate
phage scaffolds were eliminated if any gene annotations contained prokaryote-speciﬁc terms from the list ‘‘tRNA synthetase,
tRNA synthase, ribosomal protein, preprotein translocase, DNA gyrase subunit A. ’’ This yielded 322 and 708 candidate sequences
for DolJOral78 and DolZOral124, respectively.  To minimize the occurrence of false positives, we additionally required that at least one
spacer from either dolphin oral metagenome match the candidate phage scaffold.  Finally, we manually removed scaffolds which
likely encoded prophage inserted into a bacterial genome (one scaffold was removed from each sample set). 
Reﬁning selected scaffolds
The PRICE assembly algorithm [61] was used to extend scaffolds of interest, such as those containing unbinned 16S rRNA genes of
interest (in an attempt to associate them with binned scaffolds), the DolZOral124_Bacteria_38_8 genome, and the Saccharibacteria
phage.  For selected sets of scaffolds, such as those binned into one of the genomes from the two novel, phylum-level lineages, we
attempted to resolve assembly errors using ra2 [4].  We visually conﬁrmed that the scaffolds containing genes used for phylogenetic
analysis of DolZOral124_Bacteria_64_63, DolJOral78_Bacteria_63_78, and DolZOral124_Bacteria_38_8 contained no assembly errors.  This was done by mapping reads against scaffolds and using mapped. py (part of the ra2 suite) [4] to ﬁlter out mate pairs where
there was more than one mismatch to the assembled scaffold across both reads combined, and then conﬁrming that there were no
regions in the scaffolds whose assembly was not supported by the stringently mapped reads.  Ra2 [4] was also implemented on all
scaffolds containing a cas gene prior to analysis, although deposited cas-containing scaffolds are the original versions assembled by
IDBA-UD [56]. 
Bin completeness and characterization
From sample DolJOral78, we recovered 34 near complete bacterial genomes (R80% complete), 16 draft-quality partial bacterial
genomes (R50% complete), and 45 other bins.  From DolZOral124, we recovered 31 near complete bacterial genomes, 1 complete
(circular) phage genome, 25 draft-quality partial bacterial genomes, and 88 other bins.  Bins that did not qualify as draft-quality
genomes had R10 and <25 bacterial single copy genes present and/or, in some cases, contained multiple genomes from closely
related bacteria.  We calculated genome relative abundance as follows: For every genome bin (plus an artiﬁcial bin consisting of
Current Biology 27, 3752–3762. e1–e6, December 18, 2017 e3
all unbinned scaffolds) we calculated the cumulative length of all scaffolds in the bin (i. e. , genome length), as well as the average
coverage of all the scaffolds in the bin (i. e. , genome coverage).  To correct for genome size bias, we standardized genome coverage
by genome length such that:
standardized binA coverage = fraction of reads that map to binA
length binAfraction of reads that map to binA =
# reads that map to binA
# reads that map to the metagenome
After performing this calculation for every bin, we calculated relative abundance as follows:
binA relative abundance =
standardized binA coverage
total standardized community coverageWhere:
total standardized community coverage = standardized binA coverage + .  + standardized binN coverage
and N was the total number of bins recovered (including the artiﬁcial ‘‘unbinned’’ scaffold ‘‘bin’’)
Taxonomic assignment of 16S rRNA genes was performed using the RDP classiﬁer with 16S rRNA gene training set 16 [65].  For
16S rRNA genes that could not be classiﬁed by RDP classiﬁer, we attempted to identify them by a) determining whether the 16S rRNA
gene was binned with a genome of known taxonomic identity, or b) by using BLAST [18, 19] with OTUs from the previous 16S rRNA
gene survey [12] and determining whether close relatives (R95% identity) had been detected and identiﬁed. 
Phylogenetic placement of genomes
The concatenated ribosomal protein tree was created using a set of 15 ribosomal proteins (L2p, L3p, L4p, L5p, L14p, L15p, L16p,
L18p, L22p, L24p, S3p, S8p, S10p, S17p, and S19p in bacteria and the homologous archaeal proteins L8e, L3e, L1e, L11e, L23e,
L23Ae, L10e, L5e, L17e, L26e, S3e, S15Ae, S20e, S11e, and S15e) [71].
