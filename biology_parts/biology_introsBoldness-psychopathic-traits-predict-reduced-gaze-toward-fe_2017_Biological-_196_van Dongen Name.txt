in recognizing others’ emotional expressions
Facial expressions of emotion represent a crucial component of
interaction, allowing the observer to infer another's
human social
emotional state (Frith, 2009; Keltner, 2003), and adjust their behaviour
accordingly (Blair, 2003).  Children and adults aﬀected by disorders of
social and aﬀective functioning, including psychopathy, often show
diﬃcultiesO’Kearney, McKone, & Palermo, 2012; Marsh & Blair, 2008).  When categorizing expressions, attention is typically directed toward criticalthe mouth
(Eisenbarth & Alpers, 2011; Wells, Gillespie, & Rotshtein, 2016).  A
failure to attend to these regions may lead to diﬃculties in judging the
expressed emotion.  Although psychopathic traits in children and nonoﬀenders are associated with atypical eye scan paths for emotional
faces (Dadds, El Masry, Wimalaweera, & Guastella, 2008; Gillespie,
Rotshtein, Wells, Beech, & Mitchell, 2015), these relationships are yet to
be tested in a forensic sample. and
features, mostthe
Psychopathy is best understood as a collection of personality traits
that vary along a continuum in the general population (Coid, Yang,
Ullrich, Roberts, & Hare, 2009).  These traits include elevated levels of
antisocial behaviour, a callous disregard for others, and a deceitful and
manipulative interpersonal style (Hare, 2003), and are often prominent
in clinical and forensic samples (Skeem, Polaschek, Patrick, & Lilienfeld,
2011).  A triarchic conceptual framework describes psychopathy along
three core dimensions
that have been reliably identiﬁed and
distinguished in clinical and non-clinical samples, namely Boldness,
Meanness, and Disinhibition (Patrick, Fowles, & Krueger, 2009).  Boldness refers to psychologically adaptive traits emphasised by Cleckley
(1941), and includes venturesomeness, fearlessness, and interpersonal
dominance (Patrick Name, 2009).  Boldness explains a key diﬀerence
between psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder [ASPD] (Wall,
Wygant, & Sellbom, 2015), and contributes over and above Meanness
and Disinhibition to the prediction of clinical psychopathy (Venables,
Hall, & Patrick, 2014).  Meanness entails a callous disregard for others,
empathy problems, and a tendency toward exploiting others
(Drislane & Patrick, 2016).  The Disinhibition dimension refers to impulse control problems, emotional reactivity, poor behavioural restraint, and irresponsibility (Patrick Name, 2009). 
Several prominent accounts of psychopathy emphasise the presence
of emotion recognition impairments in relation to the fearless and unempathic features (e. g. , Boldness, Meanness) of the disorder (Blair,
2005, 2008; Moul, Killcross, & Dadds, 2012).  These diﬃculties have
been observed among adult male psychopaths, and in relation to the
broader psychopathy phenotype in both adults and children (Blair
Name, 2004; Dolan & Fullam, 2006; Dadds Name, 2008; Hastings,
Tangney, & Stuewig, 2008; Kosson, Suchy, Mayer, & Libby, 2002;
Prado, Treeby, & Crowe, 2015).  Although it is theorized by Blair (2005,
2008) that impairments in recognizing others distress cues (fear and
sadness) are of particular importance in psychopathy, a recent metaanalysis suggests that these diﬃculties are pervasive across fear, sad,
happy, and surprise emotional expressions (Dawel Name, 2012).

Neurobiologically inspired models of psychopathy propose that the
disorder is characterized by functional impairments in areas related to
emotion processing, including the amygdala (Blair, 2008), and the extended limbic system (Kiehl, 2006).  Support for these models comes
from studies that have shown a reduced amygdala response to fearful
expressions in both adults and children/adolescents with increasing
(Decety, Skelly, Yoder, & Kiehl, 2014; Jones,
psychopathic traits
Laurens, Herba,
Barker, & Viding,
Cardinale,
VanMeter, & Marsh, 2014). 2009;
The successful decoding of diﬀerent emotional expressions depends
on visual attention toward emotionally salient aspects of the face, most
notably the eyes and the mouth (Eisenbarth & Alpers, 2011; Smith,
Cottrell, Gosselin, & Schyns, 2005; Wells Name, 2016).  The precise
pattern of eye movements is thought to be dependent upon the emotion
expressed, and attention is often guided toward the most diagnostic
facial features for a given emotion (e. g. , the widened eye whites of
fearful expressions) (Schurgin Name, 2014; Smith Name, 2005; Wells
Name, 2016).  While attention to these regions is likely to be modiﬁed by
conscious control, even brieﬂy presented faces trigger very early, potentially reﬂexive eye movements toward diagnostic regions of the face
(Gamer & Büchel, 2009; Scheller, Büchel, & Gamer, 2012).  Again, reﬂexive eye movements in these studies were more commonly toward
the eyes than away from the eyes, and varied with the type of expression.  Psychopathy related impairments in emotion recognition may
therefore reﬂect reduced attention to the eye region of emotional faces. 
In support of this hypothesis, children with elevated callous-unemotional (CU) traits, referring to the aﬀective dimension of psychopathy, show impaired fear recognition and a reduced number and
length of ﬁxations on the eye region (Dadds Name, 2008).  When instructed to ﬁxate the eye region, these children showed normalized
levels of performance (Dadds Name, 2008).  A similar pattern of performance has also been observed in a patient with bilateral amygdala
dysfunction (Adolphs Name, 2005), and is taken as support for amygdala
based models of psychopathy.  More recent evidence from non-offending adult males has shown that the interpersonal and aﬀective
features of psychopathy are associated with reduced attention to the
eyes, and that the number of ﬁxations on the eye region is positively
correlated with fear accuracy (Gillespie, Rotshtein, Wells Name, 2015). 
Another study with non-oﬀenders has shown that equivalent measures
of Boldness, but not Meanness, are associated with reduced face exploration during a face perception task (Boll & Gamer, 2016). 
In the present study we examined eye scan paths for emotional faces
among adult male violent oﬀenders, and assessed the relationship of
distinct psychopathic traits with attention to the eyes.  For comparison
we also recruited a community control group of non-oﬀending adult
males.  Because psychopathy consists of a number of positively related
dimensions, suppressor eﬀects in statistical analyses may obscure understanding of the unique correlates of distinct psychopathic traits. 
Thus, we aimed to model these dimensional traits simultaneously in a
way that can account for their covariance (Hicks & Patrick, 2006; Lozier
Name, 2014).  We also measured levels of negative aﬀect, including
anxiety and depression, as diﬀerences in emotional face processing and
attentional allocation have been observed in these disorders (Buckner,
Maner, & Schmidt, 2010; Easter Name, 2005; Kohler, Hoﬀman, Eastman,
Healey, & Moberg, 2011).  One earlier study suggests that psychopathy
primarily aﬀects the perception of moderate intensity expressions
(Hastings Name, 2008).  Therefore in the current experiment we manipulated the intensity of the emotional expression by morphing each
prototypical expression (100%) with the neutral expression of the same
person.  Thus, participants classiﬁed expressions at 90% and 55% intensities (see Gillespie, Rotshtein, Wells Name, 2015; Gillespie,
Rotshtein, Satherley, Beech, & Mitchell, 2015; Gillespie, Mitchell,
Satherley, Beech, & Rotshtein, 2015; Wells Name, 2016). 
We predicted that the preference for information form the eye region would be absent among violent oﬀenders, and that they would
show an absence of stimulus driven eﬀects on eye scan paths.  Moreover,we predicted that distinct psychopathic traits related to a lack of empathy and fearlessness, namely Meanness and Boldness, would be associated with a pattern of impaired emotion recognition, and reduced
attention to the eyes relative to the mouth.  We tested these relationships across various parameters of attention to the eyes and the mouth:
overall dwell time, ﬁxation count, and ﬁrst ﬁxation time.  The analyses
focused on the average response across all emotions, and also speciﬁcally on the processing of fearful expressions, given ﬁndings that the
eye region is of particular importance for recognizing fear (Smith Name,
2005; Whalen Name, 2004).  Furthermore, at least one prominent theory
of psychopathy proposes that psychopaths are characterized by particular deﬁcits in recognizing others distress cues (Blair, 2005, 2008). 
<Middle> Method. 
2. 1.  Participants
Thirty male violent non-sex oﬀenders, aged between 32 and 50
years (M = 35. 1, SD = 11. 8), were recruited from HMP Grendon, UK. 
All participants had normal or corrected to normal vision.  The majority
of participants were White Caucasian (n = 19, 63%).  Index oﬀences
included, but were not limited to, murder (n = 17) or attempted
murder (n = 2), and wounding with intent (n = 3).  Case ﬁle histories
showed that no participants had a pre-diagnosed mental health problem, although one participant was taking antidepressant medication. 
The number of any previous convictions ranged from 0 to 31 (M = 9,
SD = 10), and the number of previous violent convictions ranged from
0 to 14 (M = 2, SD = 3).  All participants signed their fully informed
consent.  Ethical approval for the study was granted by the University of
Birmingham Committee for Ethical Review, and access was approved
by the National Oﬀender Management Service for England and Wales,
and the HMP Grendon Research Advisory Group. 
Eye movement data were also collected from an approximately age
matched community control group of 25 adult males, aged 18–69 years
(M = 37. 88, SD = 18. 29), to assess the typicality of the eye movements
observed in the violent oﬀender sample.  The comparison group was
recruited from the community using online advertisements and participants received a monetary payment for taking part.  None of the
control group participants reported a history of convictions for either
violent or sexual oﬀences. 
2. 2.  Materials
2. 2. 1.  Facial expression stimuli
We used a selection of the facial stimuli developed by Gillespie and
colleagues (Gillespie, Rotshtein, Wells Name, 2015 Gillespie, Rotshtein,
Satherley Name, 2015 Gillespie, Mitchell Name, 2015 Wells Name 2016)
consisting of male and female expressions displayed at varying degrees
of intensity.  These stimuli consisted of ﬁve male and ﬁve female Caucasian models,
selected from the NimStim Face Stimulus Set
(Tottenham Name, 2009; http://www. macbrain. org/resources. htm),
showing each of seven diﬀerent expressions: neutral, angry, disgust,
fear, happy, sad, and surprise.  Emotional and neutral images from the
same model were morphed to create images of varying levels of emotional intensity (see Gillespie, Rotshtein, Wells Name, 2015; Gillespie,
Rotshtein, Satherley Name, 2015; Gillespie, Mitchell Name, 2015) for
details of the morphing procedure.  Images used in the current study
consisted of each emotion, for each model, displayed at moderate (55%
expressive) and high (90% expressive) intensity.  The neutral expression
was also included for each model so that participants were not only
viewing emotional faces.  Stimuli had a resolution of 504 × 624 pixels. 
The positioning of each image on the canvas was manipulated such that
the eyes and the mouth appeared in the same location across all stimuli. 
2. 2. 2.  Measures
The Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (Drislane, Patrick, & Arsal,
S. M.  Gillespie Name
Biological Psychology 128 (2017) 29–38
2014) was used for the assessment of psychopathic traits.  The 58-item
self-report measure yields scores on three subscales: Boldness, Meanness, and Disinhibition.  Participants respond on a 4-point Likert scale
(3 = true, 2 = somewhat true, 1 = somewhat false, 0 = false).  Internal
consistencies (Cronbach’s ɑ) for the Boldness, Meanness, and Disinhibition subscales in the violent oﬀender sample were . 69, . 75, and . 91,
respectively.  Participants in the control group were also asked to
complete the TriPM for comparison, although two participants in this
group failed to complete the measure.  In order to provide a better description of the sample, participants in the violent oﬀender group were
also asked to complete the State Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]
(Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983), which contains
both State [STAI-S] and Trait [STAI-T] subscales, and the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] (Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh,
1961).  Internal consistencies for the STAI-S, STAI-T, and the BDI in the
current sample were good: Cronbach’s ɑ = . 94, . 93, and . 79. 
2. 3.  Eye tracking
We used an EyeLink 1000 corneal-reﬂection based portable eye
tracking system (SR Research Ltd. ) to record participants’ eye movements.  Although viewing was binocular, only movements of the right
eye were recorded.  Gaze location was sampled at 1000 Hz.  A Dell
Precision laptop computer was used to manage the recording of eye
movements.  Stimuli were displayed on a 19” LG colour monitor, using
SR-Research Experiment Builder software, running on a laptop computer with a separate mouse and keyboard. 
2. 6.  Data analysis
As Age is suggested to aﬀect the processing of emotional expressions, it is included as a covariate in all analyses.  For comparison with
the non-oﬀender control group, we ﬁrst examine the main eﬀects of
Group, and any interactions of Group with Emotion, Intensity, or AOI,
for accuracy, dwell
time, ﬁxation count, and ﬁrst ﬁxation time. 
However, as the focus of this paper is on the eye movements of violent
oﬀenders, we present in the main text the results for the violent offenders only.  For the results of analyses conducted on the comparison
group please see supplementary materials.  Eﬀects on accuracy were
computed using a mixed ANCOVA, with the factors Emotion (Anger,
Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise) and Intensity (55%, 90%) as repeated factors.  For the three eye tracking parameters, we computed
separate mixed ANCOVAs for each eye tracking parameter (dwell time,
ﬁxation count, ﬁrst ﬁxation time) using Emotion, Intensity, and AOI
(Eyes, Mouth) as repeated factors.  Signiﬁcant interactions were broken
down using follow up ANCOVAs and Bonferroni adjusted post hoc tests. 
To assess the relations of the TriPM subscales with accuracy and
scanning pattern in violent oﬀenders, we computed regression models
across all faces and intensities, and speciﬁcally for fearful expressions,
for each of the four dependent variables (accuracy, dwell time, ﬁxation
count, and ﬁrst ﬁxation time).  For each regression model normalized
scores of Boldness, Meanness, Disinhibition, and Age, were used as
predictors of diﬀerential attention to the Eyes and the Mouth (Eyes −2. 4.  Procedure
3.  Results
Testing took place either in a private room inside the prison, or in a
dedicated eye tracking laboratory at the university.  Participants were
seated at a desk and a chin rest of adjustable height was provided to
minimize head movements.  Participants were positioned approximately
68 cm form the display monitor, and images were presented at a visual
angle of 21. 2°.  Participants were asked to categorize the emotional
expression stimuli as quickly and accurately as possible as either neutral or one of the six basic emotions while their eye movements were
being recorded.  Standard EyeLink calibration and validation procedures were performed, each using a series of nine ﬁxation points, presented at random in one of nine locations on the screen.  Facial expression stimuli were presented in a randomized order over four blocks
of 35 trials using the EyeLink software.  At the start of each trial the
experimenter conﬁrmed that the participant’s eye gaze fell on a ﬁxation
point presented in the centre of the screen.  A ﬁxation cross was then
presented for 1000 ms, followed by an image of an emotional expression that was displayed for 2000 ms, considered to be the time taken for
an individual to judge facial aﬀect in an in vivo social interaction
(Hoaken Name, 2007).  Following display of the target expression, participants were asked to categorize the facial expression as neutral, or as
one of the six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise. 
Expression labels were displayed in a vertical list alongside the relevant
number key (e. g. , 1.  ANGER).  Responses were made using the numeric
keys 0–6. 
2. 5.  Eye movement parameters
Two separate areas of interest (AOIs) were created a-priori that included the eyes (300 × 100 pixels) and the mouth (240 × 125 pixels). 
For each AOI we were interested in the following gaze parameters:
overall dwell time, total ﬁxation count, and ﬁrst ﬁxation time.  For the
analysis of ﬁrst ﬁxation times we only included ﬁrst ﬁxations that were
initiated 100 ms after the presentation of each stimulus.  While dwell
time and ﬁxation count provide an estimate of the participants’ interest
in the eyes and the mouth, ﬁrst ﬁxation time provides an index of early
gaze shifts towards these regions. 
Mean scores and standard deviations for all self-report measures
completed by violent oﬀenders are shown in Table 1, along with the
inter-correlations between measures.  For comparison, descriptive statistics for the TriPM subscales in the non-oﬀender control group, and in
non-oﬀender (N = 496), and forensic psychiatric samples (N = 296),
reported by van Dongen Name (2017) are also included.  In the violent
oﬀender sample, there was a signiﬁcant positive correlation between
