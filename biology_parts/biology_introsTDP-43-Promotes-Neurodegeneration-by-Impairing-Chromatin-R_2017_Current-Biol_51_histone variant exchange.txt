In Brief
Berson Name show that TDP-43, a protein
associated with ALS and FTD, impairs the
stress response by interfering with the
chromatin remodeling protein Chd1 in
ﬂies and CHD2 in mammalian cells.  In
turn, animals expressing TDP-43 are
hypersensitive to various types of
stressors, indicating that this impairment
may promote neurodegeneration. 
Highlights
d TDP-43 cripples the stress response
d TDP-43 impairs nucleosomal dynamics and the induction of
heat shock genes
d TDP-43 physically interacts with ﬂy Chd1 and human CHD2
d Reduced levels of human CHD2 protein are observed in
frontotemporal dementia

https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 10. 024Regulation of chromatin structure is critical for brain
development and function.  However, the involvement of chromatin dynamics in neurodegeneration
is less well understood.  Here we ﬁnd, launching
from Drosophila models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, that TDP-43 impairs the induction of multiple key stress genes
required to protect from disease by reducing the
recruitment of the chromatin remodeler Chd1 to
chromatin.  Chd1 depletion robustly enhances TDP43-mediated neurodegeneration and promotes the
formation of stress granules.  Conversely, upregulation of Chd1 restores nucleosomal dynamics,
promotes normal
induction of protective stress
genes, and rescues stress sensitivity of TDP-43-expressing animals.  TDP-43-mediated impairments
are conserved in mammalian cells, and, importantly,
the human ortholog CHD2 physically interacts with
TDP-43 and is strikingly reduced in level in temporal
cortex of human patient
tissue.  These ﬁndings
indicate that TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration
causes impaired chromatin dynamics that prevents
appropriate expression of protective genes through
compromised function of the chromatin remodeler
Chd1/CHD2.  Enhancing chromatin dynamics may
be a treatment approach to amyotrophic lateral
scleorosis (ALS)/frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 
INTRODUCTION
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable, relentlessly
progressing neurodegenerative disease, leading to death within
3–5 years of diagnosis in most cases [1, 2].  In ALS, the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons leads to muscle atrophy,
weakness, and eventually paralysis.  Although predominantly a
motor disorder, 20% of ALS cases also develop cognitive deficits that resemble those seen in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 
Strikingly, ALS and select FTD subtypes share the pathological
hallmark of ubiquitinated inclusions composed of TDP-43 protein, encoded by the TARDBP gene [3]. 
The discovery of TARDBP mutations in ALS and FTD [4, 5]
demonstrates that TDP-43 plays causal roles in the pathogenesis of these diseases.  Therefore, understanding the molecular
events underlying TDP-43 toxicity is of special
importance. 
Indeed, abnormal TDP-43 levels and localization are toxic to
neurons [6], elicit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [7], and
impair multiple cellular processes, including axonal transport
[8], mitochondrial function [9], and RNA metabolism [10].  TDP43 is a ubiquitously expressed RNA- and DNA-binding protein,
with primarily nuclear localization.  Interestingly, TDP-43 was
originally identiﬁed as a transcriptional
[11], but
DNA-related functions of TDP-43 remain largely unexplored.

Proper chromatin regulation is critical for gene expression in
the brain [12, 13], and various epigenetic mechanisms including
DNA methylation [14], histone acetylation [15], and histone
variant exchange [16] have been shown to control memory formation and consolidation.  Recent observations also point to
possible altered histone methylation and acetylation having a
role during brain degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease [17] and
in models of tauopathies [18].
