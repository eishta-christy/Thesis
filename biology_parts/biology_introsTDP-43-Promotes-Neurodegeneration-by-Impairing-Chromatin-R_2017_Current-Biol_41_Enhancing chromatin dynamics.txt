In Brief
Berson Name show that TDP-43, a protein
associated with ALS and FTD, impairs the
stress response by interfering with the
chromatin remodeling protein Chd1 in
ﬂies and CHD2 in mammalian cells.  In
turn, animals expressing TDP-43 are
hypersensitive to various types of
stressors, indicating that this impairment
may promote neurodegeneration. 
Highlights
d TDP-43 cripples the stress response
d TDP-43 impairs nucleosomal dynamics and the induction of
heat shock genes
d TDP-43 physically interacts with ﬂy Chd1 and human CHD2
d Reduced levels of human CHD2 protein are observed in
frontotemporal dementia

https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 10. 024Regulation of chromatin structure is critical for brain
development and function.  However, the involvement of chromatin dynamics in neurodegeneration
is less well understood.  Here we ﬁnd, launching
from Drosophila models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, that TDP-43 impairs the induction of multiple key stress genes
required to protect from disease by reducing the
recruitment of the chromatin remodeler Chd1 to
chromatin.  Chd1 depletion robustly enhances TDP43-mediated neurodegeneration and promotes the
formation of stress granules.  Conversely, upregulation of Chd1 restores nucleosomal dynamics,
promotes normal
induction of protective stress
genes, and rescues stress sensitivity of TDP-43-expressing animals.  TDP-43-mediated impairments
are conserved in mammalian cells, and, importantly,
the human ortholog CHD2 physically interacts with
TDP-43 and is strikingly reduced in level in temporal
cortex of human patient
tissue.  These ﬁndings
indicate that TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration
causes impaired chromatin dynamics that prevents
appropriate expression of protective genes through
compromised function of the chromatin remodeler
Chd1/CHD2.  Enhancing chromatin dynamics may
be a treatment approach to amyotrophic lateral
scleorosis (ALS)/frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 
INTRODUCTION
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable, relentlessly
progressing neurodegenerative disease, leading to death within
3–5 years of diagnosis in most cases [1, 2].
