https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 014Tensile forces regulate epithelial homeostasis, but
the molecular mechanisms behind this regulation
are poorly understood.  Using structured illumination microscopy and proximity ligation assays, we
show that the tight junction protein ZO-1 exists in
stretched and folded conformations within epithelial cells, depending on actomyosin-generated
force.  We also show that ZO-1 and ZO-2 regulate
the localization of the transcription factor DbpA
and the tight junction membrane protein occludin
in a manner that depends on the organization of
the actin cytoskeleton, myosin-II activity, and substrate stiffness, resulting in modulation of gene
expression, cell proliferation, barrier function, and
cyst morphogenesis.  Pull-down experiments show
that interactions between N-terminal (ZPSG) and
C-terminal domains of ZO-1 prevent binding of
DbpA to the ZPSG, suggesting that force-dependent
interactions regulate ZPSG
binding to ligands within cells.  In vivo and in vitro
experiments also suggest that ZO-1 heterodimerization with ZO-2 promotes the stretched conformation and ZPSG interaction with ligands.  Magnetic
tweezers single-molecule experiments suggest
that pN-scale tensions (2–4 pN) are sufﬁcient to
maintain the stretched conformation of ZO-1, while
keeping its structured domains intact, and that
5–20 pN force is required to disrupt the interaction
between the extreme C-terminal and the ZPSG
domains of ZO-1.  We propose that tensile forces
regulate epithelial homeostasis by activating ZO
proteins through stretching, to control the junctional recruitment and downstream signaling of
their interactors. 
intra-molecular
INTRODUCTION
Extrinsic and intrinsic forces control the conformation of mechanosensing proteins at cadherin- and integrin-based junctions,
regulating their association with the actin cytoskeleton and the
strength of adhesion; however, little is known about how force
regulates homeostasis, proliferation, and morphogenesis [1, 2]. 
Cytoplasmic actomyosin controls the nuclear shuttling of transcription factors [3], and junctional actomyosin affects tight
junction (TJ) barrier function [4–8], but it is not known whether
any TJ protein can respond to tension by changing its conformation and how this may affect proteins involved in barrier function
and signaling to the nucleus. 
ZO-1 and ZO-2 (Zonula Occludens-1 and -2) [9, 10] are cytoplasmic TJ proteins, which anchor actin ﬁlaments to membrane
proteins through their C-terminal regions [11, 12].  The C-terminal
half of ZO-1 comprises actin-binding and ZU5 domains [13] and,
when exogenously expressed, does not localize at junctions but
in the cytoplasm, associated with actin ﬁlaments [11, 12, 14].  The
N-terminal half of ZO-1 comprises three PDZ domains, followed
by Src homology-3 (SH3), unique-5 (U5), guanylate kinase
(GUK), and unique-6 (U6) domains [15, 16].  The PDZ1 and
PDZ3 domains bind to the TJ membrane proteins claudins and
JAM [17, 18], and the PDZ2 domain promotes heterodimerization between ZO-1 and either ZO-2 or ZO-3, another member
of the ZO family of proteins [11, 19, 20], which is not expressed
in Eph4 epithelial cells [21].  The region of ZO-1 comprising PDZ3,
SH3, U5, and GUK domains (ZPSG-1) interacts with and recruits
to junctions the transmembrane TJ protein occludin [11, 22], the
Y-box transcription factor DbpA/ZONAB (DNA-binding protein
A/ZO-1-associated Nucleic Acid Binding protein) [23, 24], and
other ligands [13].  ZO-2 is also critical for the junctional recruitment and function of occludin [25, 26].  DbpA regulates gene
expression and cell proliferation, and its sequestration by ZO-1
and ZO-2 at junctions of conﬂuent monolayers inhibits its nuclear
activity [23, 24, 27, 28].  Occludin is implicated in the regulation
of TJ barrier function [29–31], although occludin knockout
mice have normal TJ [32].  Because ZO-1 and ZO-2 link TJ
membrane proteins to actin ﬁlaments, we hypothesized that
Current Biology 27, 3783–3795, December 18, 2017 ª 2017 Elsevier Ltd.  3783
their conformation and downstream interactions and signaling
might be modulated by force.  Here, we show that ZO-1 exists
in different force-dependent conformations and that the organization and contractility of the actomyosin cytoskeleton control
the ability of ZO-1 and ZO-2 to recruit to junctions DbpA and
occludin, to modulate gene expression, cell proliferation, barrier
function, and epithelial morphogenesis. 
<Middle> RESULTS. 
Structured Illumination Microscopy and Proximity
Ligation Assay Demonstrate Tension-Dependent
Changes in ZO-1 Conformation within Cells
To test whether force controls ZO-1 conformation, we expressed
ZO-1 tagged with myc and hemagglutinin (HA) at its N-terminal
and C-terminal ends (Figure 1A) in ZO-1-KO (knockout) epithelial
(Eph4) cells.  Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and proximity ligation assay (PLA) were used to examine the global spatial
relationships between the ends of ZO-1 either in control cells or
in cells depleted of ZO-2, with or without treatment with blebbistatin, which inhibits myosin-II activity.  Exogenous ZO-1 was targeted to junctions and was detectable in the cytoplasm only in
overexpressing cells (Figures S1A and S1B).  A shift in the distribution of signal corresponding to myc and HA was detected in
cells treated with a control small interfering RNA (siRNA), regardless of the absence (Figure 1B) or the presence (Figure 1C) of
blebbistatin, and in cells depleted of ZO-2 and not treated with
blebbistatin (Figure 1D), indicating a spatial separation between
the ends of ZO-1.  In contrast, depletion of ZO-2 plus blebbistatin
treatment resulted in overlapped myc and HA signals (Figure 1E). 
Imaging of multicolor beads showed negligible chromatic shift
(Figures 1F–1F’’ and S1C), excluding the possibility that the shift
between the two ZO-1 tags reﬂects spherical aberrations.  In
junctions between two cells expressing tagged ZO-1, a central
myc-(N-terminal)-labeled region was ﬂanked by two HA-(C-terminal)-labeled regions (Figure 1G), corresponding to a mirrorlike arrangement of ZO-1 molecules on the two sides.  The
tagged cingulin, which contains a z130-nm-longdomain [33], were also imaged as separate (Figures S1D–S1F). 
Plotting the intensity of the signals as a function of the linear distance across the junction indicated a shift of z75 nm between
the peaks of green and red ﬂuorophores of ZO-1 when the
signals were separated and z1 nm when they overlapped
(Figures 1H and 1I).  When measured across the two sides of
a junction, the distance between the green ﬂuorophores was
z200 nm (Figure S1G). 
Next, we examined tension-dependent changes in ZO-1
conformation using the PLA assay (Figures 1J and 1K).  Little or
no PLA signal was generated by myc and HA in the absence

can be estimated based on the step
size.  This was mainly in the range of
50–200 aa (Figure 2E), consistent with
the number of residues in the structured
domains of ZO-1 (Figure S2J).  Furthermore, the estimated total number of residues (600–900 residues) involved in the
unfolding events spans 35%–50% of the
full-length ZO-1 sequence (Figure 2E,
inset), most likely within the N-terminal
half of ZO-1, which contains most
(500 aa) of the known structured domains (Figure S2J).  The rest of the molecule, most likely the C-terminal half of the
molecule, might be either in an intrinsically disordered conformation or mechanically too weak to be
determined experimentally.  Based on an assumption that the
fraction (50%–65%) of ZO-1 that does not give detectable unfolding events exists in a disordered conformation, we estimate
that a force of 2–4 pN is needed to maintain the stretched
conformation of ZO-1 (Figure 2F), with an N-to-C distance of
75 nm (Figures 1H and 1I).  This force is smaller than that
needed to unfold the structured domains (>5 pN; Figures 2B–
2D) and in the range of refolding forces (<5 pN; Figure 2C). 
Interestingly, occasionally large extension jumps involving
>500 residues were observed (Figures 2E and S2E), which
might be related to intra-molecular interactions between distal
regions of ZO-1. 
The Stretched Conformation of ZO Proteins Promotes
the Junctional Localization of DbpA and Occludin In Vivo
Next, we asked how the stretched versus folded and/or disordered conformations of ZO-1 affected the junctional accumulation of DbpA (Figure 3) and occludin (Figure S3).  In wild-type
(WT) cells in the absence of blebbistatin, DbpA was detectedthe presence/depletion of ZO-2
(Figures 3A and 3C) [24].  However, upon blebbistatin treatment,
DbpA labeling was reduced at junctions of ZO-2-depleted, but
junctions regardless of
Current Biology 27, 3783–3795, December 18, 2017 3785
of blebbistatin, regardless of the presence/depletion of ZO-2
(arrowheads, Figure 1J),
indicating that the N-terminal and
C-terminal regions of ZO-1 are >30–40 nm apart, and no headto-tail aggregation of ZO-1 occurs.  In contrast, in the presence
of blebbistatin,
the PLA signal was dramatically increased
upon depletion of ZO-2 and was detectable both at junctions
and in the cytoplasm of overexpressing cells (arrows,
Figure 1K; quantiﬁcation, Figures S1H and S1I).  This indicates
that depletion of ZO-2 and low tension promote the proximity
(<30–40 nm) between the ends of ZO-1. 
The Mechanical Stability of Full-Length ZO-1 In Vitro
To probe the mechanical stability of ZO-1, we applied force to
puriﬁed recombinant full-length single molecules using magnetic tweezers [34, 35] (Figure 2A).  When force was linearly
increased (loading rate 1 pN/s), the domains of ZO-1 were mechanically unfolded at forces of 5–60 pN, as indicated by multiple extension steps (Figures 2B, S2A, S2C, S2E, and S2G–S2I). 
The unfolded domains of ZO-1 could be refolded at forces <5
pN (loading rate  0. 1 pN/s; Figures 2C, 2D, S2B, S2D, and
S2F).  The distribution of unfolding forces shows that the majority of the domains unfold at 5–25 pN (Figure 2D).  For each unfolding event, the number of residues of the unfolding domain

not WT cells (Figures 3B and 3C).  DbpA levels were reduced in
cells depleted of ZO-2 and treated with blebbistatin (red box,
Figure 3D), similar to ZO-1-KO cells depleted of ZO-2 [24].  Junctional

cells (Figure S3B). 
labeling for occludin was normal
Because DbpA and occludin interact with both ZO-1 and
ZO-2 [11, 22, 24], we used ZO-1-KO cells to ask whether tension affects not only ZO-1- but also ZO-2-dependent junctional
accumulation of DbpA and occludin.  In addition, we tested
drugs that affect the organization of the actin cytoskeleton by
treating mixed cultures of WT and ZO-1-KO cells with either latrunculin A, which prevents the polymerization of actin ﬁlaments; CK-869, which inhibits Arp2/3-dependent nucleation
of branched actin ﬁlaments; SMIFH2, which inhibits the
formin-dependent nucleation of bundled actin ﬁlaments
(Figure 3E); and blebbistatin (Figure 3F).  DbpA was localized at
junctions of ZO-1-KO cells without any drug (arrows, Figure 3E,
control), consistent with the notion that ZO-2 alone, in the
absence of ZO-1, can sequester DbpA at junctions of conﬂuent
cells [24].  However, upon treatment with drugs that inhibit actin
ﬁlament polymerization, DbpA was undetectable at junctions
of ZO-1-KO, but not WT cells (arrowheads, Figure 3E).  Similarly, treatment of mixed WT/ZO-1-KO cells with blebbistatin
induced loss of junctional DbpA only in cells expressing one
ZO protein, but not in WT cells (arrowheads, Figure 3F, BL). 
Similar to what was observed upon depletion of both ZO proteins [24], DbpA protein levels were decreased in ZO-1-KO
cells treated with blebbistatin and normal DbpA levels were
rescued by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132
(Figures 3G and 3H),
leading to detection of DbpA in the
cytoplasm and nucleus of ZO-1 KO cells (‘‘n,’’ panel BL/MG,
Figure 3F).  Occludin was also localized at junctions of both
WT and ZO-1-KO cells (arrows in Figure S3C, control), but,
upon treatment with blebbistatin, occludin labeling was
decreased at junctions of ZO-1-KO, but not WT cells (arrowhead, Figure S3C, BL).  PLA, used to detect proximity between
ZO-1 and occludin, conﬁrmed that, without blebbistatin, ZO-1
and occludin were in close proximity, regardless of ZO-2
depletion (arrows, Figure S3D).  However, in the presence of
blebbistatin, ZO-1 was not associated with occludin when
ZO-2 was depleted (arrowhead, Figure S3E). 
In summary,
loss of either actin ﬁlament organization or
myosin activity in cells lacking one ZO protein, e. g. , conditions
that lead to the folded and/or disordered conformation of ZO-1
(Figure 1), results in decreased junctional localization of DbpA
and occludin, suggesting loss of
interaction with the other
ZO protein.  These results also suggest that, similarly to ZO-1,
ZO-2 undergoes tension-dependent stretching, and that stretching activates both ZO proteins by promoting their interaction with
DbpA and occludin. 
Tension Controls Gene Expression, Cell Proliferation,
and Paracellular Barrier Function through ZO Proteins
To probe the cellular consequences of force-dependent conformational changes of ZO proteins, we analyzed signaling outputs
by DbpA [23, 28] and occludin [29–31]. 
In ZO-1-KO cells treated with blebbistatin and MG132, which
display nuclear DbpA labeling (Figure 3F), cell proliferation was
increased, as determined by Ki67 labeling, and this increase
was reduced upon depletion of DbpA, indicating that it was
DbpA dependent (Figures 4A–4B’).  When DbpA was nuclear,
qRT-PCR showed increased expression of the DbpA target
genes cyclin D1 (CCD1) and PCNA (Figure 4C) and decreased
expression of ErbB2 (Figure 4D).  These changes did not occur
in ZO-1-KO cells treated with blebbistatin alone (Figures 4C and
4D), when DbpA is not nuclear, and its levels are reduced (Figures
3F–3H).  The changes in DbpA localization cannot be due to the
effect of treatments on other proteins, because only ZO-1 and
ZO-2 regulate DbpA junctional localization in conﬂuent cells [24]. 
Regarding barrier function, in the absence of blebbistatin, no
signiﬁcant differences were observed in permeability either to
ions (transepithelial electrical resistance [TEER]; Figure 4E) or
larger molecules (Papp; Figure 4F) when comparing monolayers
of WT and ZO-1-KO cells, in agreement with previous results
[21].  However, blebbistatin induced an increase in the TEER of
WT cells, and this increase was not as strong in ZO-1-KO cells
(TEER; Figure 4E).  In addition, blebbistatin treatment resulted
in a higher ﬂux of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran in
ZO-1-KO, but not WT cells (Figure 4F), suggesting that the barrier is more sensitive to loss of actomyosin tension when only
ZO-2 is expressed. 
Together, these results suggest that the organization and
contractility of
the actomyosin cytoskeleton controls both
DbpA-dependent regulation of gene expression and occludindependent regulation of barrier function in a ZO-dependentSubstrate Stiffness and Actomyosin Contractility
Modulate Epithelial Proliferation and Cyst
Morphogenesis through ZO Proteins
Because substrate stiffness inﬂuences intracellular tension, we
examined cyst morphogenesis in 3D cultures of Eph4 cells
grown in Matrigel, a soft, more physiological substrate than glass
coverslips [36].  WT Eph4 cells formed cysts with a lumen, and
their size increased to 250 mm within 21 days (Figures 5A and
5E), correlating with normal cell numbers and proliferation
(Figures S4A, S4E, and S4F).  In contrast, ZO-1-KO cysts grew
slowly and had a diameter of 50 mm and no lumen after
21 days (Figures 5C and 5E) and decreased cell numbers and
proliferation (Figures S4C, S4E, and S4F).  To ask whether this
-deoxyadewas due to low contractility, we treated cells with 2
nosine-5-triphosphate (dATP) (Figures 5B and 5D) [37], which
enhanced actin ﬁlament
formation and myosin light chainis shown in related Figure S3.  Arrows and arrowheads indicate normal or decreased/undetected junctional labeling.  (n) in (F) (BL/MG) indicates nuclear labeling for

Intra-molecular Interactions within
ZO Proteins Prevent Their Binding
to DbpA and Occludin and Are
Inhibited by Heterodimerization and
by Force
We hypothesized that the conformation
of ZO proteins corresponding to overlapped localization of N and C termini
of ZO-1 (Figure 1) involves an auto-inhibitory intra-molecular interaction between
C-terminal and N-terminal regions, which
prevents DbpA and occludin binding
to the ZPSG domains.  To test this, we
used glutathione S-transferase (GST)
pull-down experiments, and ﬁrst showed that DbpA interacts
with ZPSG-1 and ZPSG-2, but not with ZPSG-3, whereas all
ZPSGs interact with GST-occludin (Figure S5).  Next, we examined
the potential interactions between the ZPSG and C-terminal regions of ZO-1 and ZO-2 (Figures 6A–6D).  Different constructs of
the C-terminal region of ZO-1 interacted with ZPSG-1, the strongest signal given by the extreme C-terminal fragment of ZO-1
(1,619–1,748 = Cter; Figures 6A–6B’).  Similarly, the C-terminal region of ZO-2 interacted with ZPSG-2 (Figures 6C and 6D).  Thus,
both ZO-1 and ZO-2 can potentially undergo intra-molecular interactions between their respective ZPSG and C-terminal regions. 
Next, we asked whether the interaction of the C-terminal region of ZO-1 with ZPSG-1 inhibits ZPSG-1 binding to either
DbpA or occludin.  The Cter and DbpA interact with the same
domain (SH3) within ZPSG-1 (Figures S6A–S6C), suggesting
the possibility of a competition.  Competition GST pull-down assays were conducted using HA-tagged DbpA as a prey, without
phosphorylation (Figures S4B, S4D, and S4G–S4I).  dATP did not
affect the growth rate and size of WT cysts (Figures 5B and 5E),
but it rescued the stunted growth phenotype of ZO-1-KO cysts,
resulting in size, cell number, and proliferation similar to WT (Figures 5D, 5E, S4E, and S4F).  DbpA levels were reduced in ZO-1KO cysts, compared to WT, and were rescued by dATP (Figure 5F).  In WT cysts, DbpA was nuclear at early time points,
whereas later, it was sequestered at junctions (Figures 5G and
5H), both with and without dATP.  In contrast, DbpA was low or
undetectable in ZO-1-KO cysts both at early and late time points
(Figures 5I and 5J).  dATP rescued both the expression (Figure 5F)
and localization (Figures 5I and 5J) of DbpA, correlating with
increased cyst growth (Figures S4A–S4F), and its activity was
antagonized by blebbistatin (Figure S4J).  E-cadherin was localized at junctions in both WT and ZO-1-KO cells, independently of dATP (Figures 5G–5J),summary, growth in Matrigel produced similar effects on DbpA
in agreement with [21].

Quantiﬁcation of prey binding to GST-ZPSG- is shown in (B’) and (G).  Binding of GFP-tagged ZPSG domains of ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 to either GST-DbpA or

or with increasing amounts of competing C-terminal fragments
of ZO-1 (Figures 6E–6G).  The interaction between DbpA and
ZPSG-1 was not inhibited by GFP, but was inhibited by GFPtagged fragments of the C-terminal region of ZO-1, the most
C-terminal fragment (residues 1,619–1,748 = Cter) being the
most effective (Figures 6E–6G).  Similarly, DbpA, but not CFP, inhibited the interaction between the ZPSG and the C-terminal region of ZO-2 (Figures S6D–S6F).  The dissociation equilibrium
constants (Kds) [38] for the interaction of ZPSG-1 with Cter and
with DbpA were 66 nM and 100 nM, respectively (Figures
S6G–S6J), suggesting that binding of Cter to the ZPSG can
result in DbpA dissociation.  Finally, competition pull-down assays using the C-terminal region of occludin as a prey showed
that the GFP-tagged Cter, but not GFP alone, inhibited the interaction between ZPSG-1 and the C-terminal region of occludin
(Figures 6H–6J).  Together, these data indicate that the C-terminal regions of ZO proteins can compete with the ZPSG interactors DbpA and occludin for binding to the ZPSG.

separated by a long ﬂexible (FH1) linker
and spanned between mechanically stable titin (I27) domains (Figure 7A).  The
Cter was allowed to interact with the
ZPSG by keeping a near-zero force
(<1 pN) for several minutes.  Then, force
was increased (loading rate 1 pN/s) to
induce rupture of the ZPSG-Cter complex, resulting in a large extension increase step, due to releasing of the FH1
loop, in addition to the unfolding of the
ZPSG domains (PDZ3, SH3, and GUK;
Figure 7B).  Next, force was decreased
( 1 pN/s) to allow refolding of the domains and reformation of the complex
before the next
force-increase scan. 
Representative force-extension curves
from the same molecule show typically
three extension-jump events in each
force-increase scan (Figure 7B).  The
events with step sizes of 20–50 nm
(60–200 residues) most
likely correspond to the unfolding of
the ZPSG
domains. 
the step with
the largest size (>100 nm) at forces of
5–20 pN (release of >300 aa) is consistent
with the rupture of the ZPSG-Cter interaction, which releases the FH1 loop (182 aa) and the Cter (129 aa). 
To quantify the force-dependent unfolding of the domains and
the rupture of the ZPSG-Cter interaction, the distributions of
the unfolding contour lengths and the corresponding number
of released residues involved were plotted (Figure 7C).  Interestingly, the rupture forces of the ZPSG-Cter interaction (events
involving R300 released residues) distribute widely from 5
to 40 pN at 1 pN/s loading rate (Figure 7D).  One possibility is
that the ZPSG-Cter interaction takes place under different orientations (Figure 7A), resulting in a shear force or an unzipping
force stretching geometry, which have different force-dependent rupture kinetics.  The majority of domain-unfolding events
(involving <300 aa) are distributed at forces of 5–15 pN

Because full-length ZO-1 does not interact with GST-DbpA
[24], and experiments on cells indicated a role of heterodimerization in stabilizing the stretched conformation of ZO-1 under
low tension (Figure 3), we asked whether ZO-2 promotes the
interaction of ZO-1 with DbpA.  Using GST-DbpA as a bait, we
detected ZO-1 in pull-downs when increasing amounts of vsvtagged ZO-2 (Figures 6K–6M), but not p114-RhoGEF (Figures
6L and 6M) was present.  This suggests that heterodimerization
stabilizes the stretched ZO-1 conformation in vitro, thus promoting ZPSG-ligand interactions. 
Finally, we investigated whether the postulated auto-inhibitory
interaction between the ZPSG and Cter of ZO-1 is regulated
by force.  We designed a construct where these domains are
(Figure 7D), consistent with the data obtained from the unfolding
force distribution of the ZPSG domain alone (Figures 7E and 7F)
and also consistent with the unfolding force distribution of fulllength ZO-1 (Figure 2).  The small fraction of unfolding events at
>20 pN (Figure 7F) might indicate that the domains (SH3/GUK)
could be within the loop stabilized by the ZPSG-Cter interaction,
which is excluded from the force-transmission pathway until
rupture of the complex. 
<Conclusion> DISCUSSION. 
ZO-1 and ZO-2 are essential to assemble epithelial barriers
and to organize the junctional actomyosin cytoskeleton through
their interaction with TJ membrane proteins, actin-binding proteins, and regulators of Rho guanosine triphosphatases
(GTPases) (reviewed in [13]).  Thus, understanding how actomyosin contractility controls the conformation and functions of
ZO-1 and ZO-2 is essential to clarify the mechanistic interplay
between the cytoskeleton and TJ, and its effects on cell
behavior.  The ZPSG is critical for the junctional localization of
ZO-1 and its interaction with occludin, as well as for barrier formation and epithelial polarization [14, 16, 39–42].  Our experiments extend previous studies by showing that the C-terminal
regions of ZO-1 and ZO-2 interact with their respective ZPSGs
and that the Cter of ZO-1 inhibits the binding of DbpA and occludin to the ZPSG-1.  Force is required to disrupt the Cter-ZPSG-1
interaction in vitro, and we speculate that, within cells, force may
act both by disrupting the Cter-ZPSG-1 interaction and by
affecting intra-molecular interactions within the ZPSG-1 [16] to
allow modulation of ligand binding (Figure S7).  Because the
C-terminal half of ZO-1 most likely has a disordered conformation and is mechanically weak, the full-length protein can be
extended at forces (2–4 pN), within the physiological range
[43].  Collectively, our experiments suggest that force acts as
an allosteric effector, by stretching ZO proteins, to promote
the interaction of the ZPSG with its ligands.  PDZ2-mediated
heterodimerization, which is important for the circumferential
distribution of ZO-1 at TJ [41] and for the claudin scaffolding
functions of ZO proteins [39], also promotes the stretched
conformation of ZO-1.  We propose that the stretched conformation of ZO proteins is the active conformation, whereas the
folded and/or disordered conformation is the inactive form,
where the ZPSG region is auto-inhibited (Figure S7).  Because
the ZPSG-1 also binds to a-catenin, afadin, JAM, Apg-2, vinculin, and Shroom2 [13], force-dependent changes in ZO-1 conformation may also regulate its interaction with these proteins. 
We used SIM and PLA to characterize the conformations of
ZO-1.  In the stretched conformation, the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of ZO-1 were separated by z75 nm, which is compatible with the number of residues of ZO-1, although this is probably not an accurate measure of molecular length, due to
tags, ﬁxation, and potential bends in the molecule.  The spatial
separation between the ends of ZO-1 is in agreement with
biotin-ligase tagging experiments, showing that the N and C
termini of ZO-1 are embedded in different functional subcompartments of the TJ [44], and with immunoelectron microscopy
and SIM experiments, showing that cingulin, which is enriched
in the ZO-1 C-terminal compartment [44], is farther away from
the TJ membrane than ZO-1 [45, 46].  Because the N-terminal
3792 Current Biology 27, 3783–3795, December 18, 2017
half of ZO-1 binds to junctional membrane components,
whereas the C-terminal half associates with cytoplasmic actin ﬁlaments [11, 12, 14], in the stretched conformation the N-terminal
region should be immediately proximal
to the membrane,
whereas the C-terminal region should extend at some angle toward the cell interior, interacting with actin ﬁlaments (Figures
S7A–S7C).  It is difﬁcult to deﬁne precisely the spatial conﬁguration of ZO-1 when its N and C termini are overlapped by SIM and
generate a junctional PLA signal.  Our interpretation that an intramolecular self-looping interaction occurs between the C-terminal and ZPSG domains of ZO-1, leading to auto-inhibitory folding
(Figure S7D), is based on (1) the interaction of ZPSG-1 with
C-terminal fragments of ZO-1, suggesting that this interaction
could occur in vivo; (2) magnetic tweezers experiments, showing
that force is required to dissociate the Cter of ZO-1 from the
ZPSG-1, suggesting that in cells, actomyosin contractility could
disrupt the same interaction within the full-length molecule; and
(3) competition experiments showing that the Cter competes
with DbpA and occludin for binding to the ZPSG in vitro, accounting for the reduced junctional accumulation of DbpA and
occludin in intact cells.  An alternative hypothesis is that the
colocalization of the ends of ZO-1 may be due to inter-molecular
interactions between stretched molecules following their disordered collapse induced by loss of tension.  This hypothesis would
require, in contrast to evidence [11, 12, 14], either that ZO-1
undergoes head-to-tail aggregation, and/or that the C-terminal
region of ZO-1 binds with high afﬁnity, independently of the
N-terminal region, to heterologous junctional components, in order to be retained proximal to the junctional membrane.  Furthermore, if ZO-1 was stretched, the DbpA and occludin binding
sites should be available, at variance with the decrease in their
junctional localization under low tension, and there should be a
wider distribution of the overlapped signal, because molecules
would be distributed at random angles.  The possibility that inter-molecular interactions occur in cis is also unlikely, because
although ZO-1 molecules along TJ membrane may be closely
spaced [47], the intra-molecular interaction is always more favorable, based on Boltzmann distribution.  In summary, it is more
likely that, in the absence of tension, junctional ZO-1 remains
anchored to the membrane through binding of N-terminal domains to their interactors, whereas the C-terminal half of the
molecule binds intra-molecularly to the ZPSG (Figure S7D). 
Additional mutagenesis, structural, and ﬂuorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) studies will be required to clarify the organization of ZO-1 in its folded and/or disordered conformation,
with the caveat that mutations and FRET sensors could alter
ZO-1 functional behavior and intra-molecular interactions within
the ZPSG [16].  Here, we added tags to the ends of ZO-1 to
minimize artifacts due to insertions/mutations within conformation-sensitive regions.  We also propose that ZO-2 has forcedependent stretched/folded conformations, but additional
studies will be required to conﬁrm this hypothesis. 
A limitation of our approach is that we analyzed ﬁxed cells,
where soluble proteins may be removed by permeabilization. 
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies
show that in vivo the association of ZO-1 with the membrane
is dynamic, with a cytosolic pool
in equilibrium with a membrane-associated pool
the folded
conformation is enriched in the cytosolic pool and prior to
[48].  We speculate that
junction assembly, whereas heterodimerization and association
with actomyosin enhances the junctional assembly of ZO proteins, by locking them in a stretched conformation, which promotes binding to ZPSG ligands.  This model
is in agreement
with previous experiments showing that ZO-1 lacking the whole
C terminus localizes only partially to junctions [14] and that ZO-1
mutants lacking the actin-binding domain display a signiﬁcantly
greater mobile fraction [8], indicating that linkage to actomyosin
greatly enhances the junctional localization of ZO-1.  To explore
further the role of heterodimerization and of interactions between
the Cter and ZPSG domains on the dynamics of ZO-1 exchange
in vivo will require detailed mutagenesis, structural, and FRET
analyses, with the above-mentioned caveats. 
We investigated the cellular consequences of tension-dependent ZO protein functions by focusing on how the localization and
expression of occludin and DbpA correlated with changes in barrier function, cell proliferation, and cyst growth.  Loss of ZO-1
combined with blebbistatin treatment resulted in decreased barrier function, in agreement with [7, 8].  The decreased junctional
localization of occludin under these conditions may be mechanistically relevant, although the precise role of occludin in
the regulation of paracellular permeability is unclear [29–32]. 
Stretching of ZO proteins could therefore represent a mechanism to couple force generation by the actin cytoskeleton to
the strengthening of the TJ barrier.  With regards to DbpA, its
loss from junctions and degradation correlated with decreased
cell proliferation, in agreement with previous studies [28].  The
effects of MG132 and dATP suggest that tension- and ZOdependent sequestration of DbpA in interphase cells is required
for stabilization and subsequent DbpA activation in proliferating
cells.  Interestingly, whereas we observed a slow growth and proliferation of ZO-1-KO Eph4 cysts, depletion of ZO-1 in MDCK
cells does not decrease cyst size and proliferation [28, 42]. 
DbpA localization and expression were not determined in previous studies [28, 42], so these discrepancies may be due to
different cellular models (Eph4 versus MDCK cells) and experimental approaches (KO/KD, collagen/Matrigel).  Collectively,
our observations suggest that junctional mechanics modulate
the stability and signaling of DbpA through ZO proteins, affecting
epithelial proliferation and morphogenesis. 
In summary, we provide evidence that ZO-1 exists in different
force-dependent conformations and that myosin-II-dependent
contractility and actin organization, as well as heterodimerization, regulate the functional interactions of ZO-1 and ZO-2.  We
propose that activation of ZO proteins by stretching is a new
mechanism of cross-talk between the contractile cytoskeleton
and junctions, whereby force orchestrates junctional organization, barrier function, and nuclear signaling by regulating the
ZPSG-dependent recruitment of ZO protein ligands.  This could
be a novel mechanism through which forces regulate homeostasis of epithelia and endothelia.
