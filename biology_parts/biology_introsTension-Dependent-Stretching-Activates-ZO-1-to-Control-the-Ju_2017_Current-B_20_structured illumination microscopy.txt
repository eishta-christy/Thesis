In Brief
Spadaro Name use super-resolution
microscopy to show that ZO-1, a protein
that connects tight junction membrane
proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, exists
in either stretched or folded
conformations, depending on
actomyosin-dependent force, resulting in
changes in the localization, stability, and
downstream signaling of its interactors. 
Highlights
d The tight junction protein ZO-1 exists in stretched and folded
conformations
d Actin organization, myosin activity, and heterodimerization
control ZO-1 conformation
d The stretched conformation of ZO-1 recruits DbpA and
occludin to junctions
d Barrier function and proliferation are controlled by
actomyosin through ZO proteins

https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 014Tensile forces regulate epithelial homeostasis, but
the molecular mechanisms behind this regulation
are poorly understood.  Using structured illumination microscopy and proximity ligation assays, we
show that the tight junction protein ZO-1 exists in
stretched and folded conformations within epithelial cells, depending on actomyosin-generated
force.  We also show that ZO-1 and ZO-2 regulate
the localization of the transcription factor DbpA
and the tight junction membrane protein occludin
in a manner that depends on the organization of
the actin cytoskeleton, myosin-II activity, and substrate stiffness, resulting in modulation of gene
expression, cell proliferation, barrier function, and
cyst morphogenesis.
