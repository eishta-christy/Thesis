In recent years, opioids have become the second most commonly
initiated drug of abuse.  A study by the National Survey of Drug Use and
Health revealed that 12. 5 million Americans reported opioid abuse.  As a
consequence, the incidence of overdose is reaching alarming rates
across North America [1]. 
A major limiting factor in the ﬁght against opioid abuse is the
limited number of therapies currently available.  Despite the current
situation, there is no eﬀective medical treatment for this type of addiction.  Substitution therapies are the only options currently available,
consisting of a slow acting opioid such as methadone [2] or in some
cases a combination of partial agonists (buprenorphine) and antagonists
(naltrexone) [1].  Despite some success in controlling drug intake, these
therapies do not treat drug seeking directly and are often unsuccessful
[1], leading to a high rate of relapse.  Therefore, increasing eﬀorts are
being put toward the development of drug addiction models to study
the biological mechanism of substance abuse and to ﬁnd new treatment
options.  So far, rodents and non-human primates have been used almost
exclusively [3]. 
Over the years, two main categories of assays have been developed
to study addiction in animal models.  The ﬁrst consists of the non-contingent assays, including locomotor sensitization and the conditioned
place preference paradigms.  The second category consists of the contingent models, including diﬀerent types of self-administration assays
requiring a self-operant response in order to receive a dose [4].  Contingent assays are considered more signiﬁcant and have been shown to
be an eﬃcient way to identify compounds aﬀecting addiction [5].  One
of the main diﬀerences between these two categories resides in the fact
that conditioned place preference is a form of passive administration, as
opposed to self-administration, which is an active administration.  This
distinction is important because studies have demonstrated that active
administration leads to diﬀerent molecular and structural changes in
the addicted brain [6,7]. 
An interesting alternative to rodents or non-human primates in
fundamental research is Danio rerio (zebraﬁsh), which is becoming an
important model for dissecting complex neurological disorders [8,9]. 
Previous studies demonstrated that zebraﬁsh are sensitive to a wide
variety of drugs of abuse [10–15], including opioids [11,16].  In fact,
several important neuronal networks implicated in addiction in humans
are conserved in zebraﬁsh [17,18].  As with other models, ﬁsh show
signs of addiction as well as withdrawal symptoms [19–22]. ⁎ Corresponding author.

addition, given its ease of genetic manipulation and the ability to perform in vivo small molecule screening, zebraﬁsh have potential to be a
powerful addition to the addiction research community. 
Thus far, most substance abuse research in zebraﬁsh has been based
on the conditioned place preference paradigm [11,13,14,23].  In these
assays, a drug is delivered in a speciﬁc area of a tank combined with a
speciﬁc visual cue, and trained ﬁsh developed a preference for the area
presenting the cue.
