Important clues to retrosplenial cortex (areas 29, 30) function come
from its connectivity.  This posterior cingulate region has dense interconnections with the anterior thalamic nuclei, as well as with hippocampal and parahippocampal regions [1–6].  Reﬂecting these connections, the rat retrosplenial cortex contributes to spatial memory and
navigation [7–12].
