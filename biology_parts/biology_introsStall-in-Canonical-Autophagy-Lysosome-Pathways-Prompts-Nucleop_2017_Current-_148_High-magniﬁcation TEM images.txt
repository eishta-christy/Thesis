The terminal stages of neuronal degeneration
and death in neurodegenerative diseases remain
elusive.  Autophagy is an essential catabolic process frequently failing in neurodegeneration.  Selective autophagy routes have recently emerged,
including nucleophagy, deﬁned as degradation of
nuclear components by autophagy.  Here, we
show that,
for the polyglutamine disease dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy
(DRPLA), progressive acquirement of an ataxic
phenotype is linked to severe cerebellar cellular pathology, characterized by nuclear degeneration
through nucleophagy-based LaminB1 degradation
and excretion.  We ﬁnd that canonical autophagy
is stalled in DRPLA mice and in human ﬁbroblasts
from patients of DRPLA.  This is evidenced by
accumulation of p62 and downregulation of LC3I/II conversion as well as reduced Tfeb expression. 
Chronic autophagy blockage in several conditions,
including DRPLA and Vici syndrome, an early-onset
autolysosomal pathology, leads to the activation of
alternative clearance pathways including Golgi
membrane-associated
nucleophagy-based
LaminB1 degradation and excretion.  The combination of these alternative pathways and canonical
autophagy blockade, results in dramatic nuclear
pathology with disruption of the nuclear organization, bringing about
terminal cell atrophy and
degeneration.  Thus, our ﬁndings identify a novel
progressive mechanism for the terminal phases of
neuronal cell degeneration and death in human
neurodegenerative diseases and provide a link beand
tween autophagy block, activation of alternative
pathways for degradation, and excretion of cellular
components. 
INTRODUCTION
Nuclear homeostasis has recently been the focus of attention in
aggregation-prone neurodegenerative disorders.  In particular,
defects in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and deregulation of nuclear matrix have been identiﬁed as potential pathomechanisms
in several conditions [1–4].  Mutation in genes encoding nuclear
lamina constituents have been associated with degradation of
nuclear components by autophagy [5], in a process further
deﬁned as nucleophagy. 
Autophagy affects onset and progression of several human
reﬂecting its key role as a
neurodegenerative diseases,
regulator of neuronal proteostasis and organelle quality control [6].  Bulk or selected cargos are recruited by autophagy
receptors, like p62, to forming double-membrane vesicles,
the autophagosomes, marked by the lipid-conjugated form
of LC3, LC3-II.  Mature autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes
to form autolysosomes where the cargo is digested by lysosomal enzymes and basic molecules are recycled back to
the cytoplasm [7].  Nucleophagy, a selective autophagy mechanism, has been linked to LaminB1 degradation through
direct interaction with LC3 as a mechanism of protection
from oncogenesis and of
toward cellular
senescence [8].  However, the importance of nucleophagy
and its relationship with neuronal degeneration has not
been established.

Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are neurological conditions due to an expanded CAG repeat resulting in polyQ
stretches in the encoded protein.  This family of disorders
includes Huntington’s disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian
atrophy (DRPLA), and several spinocerebellar ataxias.  DRPLA
is caused by the expansion of a CAG stretch in the

choreoathetoid symptoms as well as myoclonus, generalized
epilepsy, and dementia with extensive cellular degeneration

the dentate nucleus, DN) [10]. 
recapitulating important aspects of
Several DRPLA mouse models have been previously generated, all
the disease
[11–13].  We have predicted dysfunctional autophagy from
previous Drosophila studies on DRPLA [14, 15].  Here, we
show that progressive development of an ataxic phenotype
in DRPLA mice is linked to severe cellular pathology in
relevant neuroanatomical regions.  We reveal that neurodegeneration is associated with a stall in canonical autophagy
and the activation of alternative pathways of Golgi-dependent
and nucleophagy-based degradation and excretion of
LaminB1,
leading to disruption of nuclear integrity and to
cell atrophy. 
<Middle> RESULTS. 
Progression of Motor Behavior Defects in DRPLA Mice
The behavioral phenotypes of ATN1-FL-26Q-84 (ATN1-FL-26Q)
and ATN1-FL-65Q-105 (ATN1-FL-65Q) mouse lines were evaluated in greater detail than previously reported.  Compared to
both wild-type (WT) mice and the ATN1-FL-26Q-84 (ATN1-FL26Q) line, the ATN1-FL-65Q-105 (ATN1-FL-65Q) line showed
clear decline in the rotarod (Figures S1A and S1B) and grip
strength tests (Figures 1A–1D).  This was also reﬂected in the
earlier onset of jerky movements, tremors, hind limb clasping,
seizures, and a stronger progressive lack of weight gain (Figures
S1C and S1D; Movie S1). 
Furthermore, the ATN1-FL-26Q and ATN1-FL-65Q lines
seemed to be hyperactive compared to WT.  ATN1-FL-26Q
mice showed increased explorative behavior (Figure S1E;
Movie S2), while the ATN1-FL-65Q mice appeared rather
aggressive and anxious, as reﬂected in increased thigmotaxis (Figure 1E) [16].  The ATN1-FL-26Q line also showed a
signiﬁcant increase in general activity as compared to WT
mice (Figures 1F and S1F).  ATN1-FL-65Q, but not ATN1FL-26Q, displayed a severely altered, distinctively ataxic
gait (Figure 1G). 
Stall in Autophagy in DRPLA
Previous Drosophila studies indicated a blockage of autophagic
clearance in DRPLA [14]. 
Lipofuscin accumulates during aging and also in lysosomal
storage disorders with dysfunctional autophagy [17].  We found
a signiﬁcant accumulation of lipofuscin in DRPLA mouse models
in several brain regions (Figures 2A–2C, S2A, and S2B). 
This was conﬁrmed in transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) micrographs from DN cells (Figures 2D–2F) showing electron-dense tertiary lysosomes, characterized as lipofuscin,
especially in the ATN1-FL-65Q mice (Figures 2F and 2G). 
Furthermore, in ATN1-FL-65Q we observed accumulations of
multilamellar bodies (Figure 2I), and of double-membrane autophagic vesicles, often containing partially preserved debris (Figures 2J–2L), suggesting incomplete digestion. 
The autophagy ﬂux was evaluated in vivo using GFP-LC3
transgenic mice [18].  DN cells in ATN1-FL-65Q mice showed a
signiﬁcant increase in GFP-LC3 puncta, as early as 3 weeks of
age, with further increase observed in end-stage animals (Figures 2M and 2N).  Similar effects were observed in the RN in
the brainstem (Figure S2E), but not in the GP (Figure S2F) and
in any other forebrain region (Figure S2E).  The ATN1-FL-26Q
line showed an initial increase of GFP-LC3 puncta in the DN at
3 weeks but not at end-stage (Figures 2M and 2N) in any of the
brain areas analyzed (Figures S2E and S2F). 
The number of LAMP2A positive lysosomes did not differ
across genotypes (Figure S2C); however, the number of GFPLC3/LAMP2A double-positive autolysosomes was increased in
ATN1-FL-65Q (and partially in ATN1-FL-26Q) DN cells at 3 weeks
(Figure S2D).  At end-stage, normalizing the GFP-LC3/LAMP2A
double-positive puncta, over the total of GFP-LC3 puncta (reﬂecting the ratio of autolysosomes over the total of autophagic
vesicles) the number of autolysosomes had actually decreased
in the ATN1-FL-65Q and ATN1-FL-26Q lines (Figure 2O).  This
contrasts with the initial
increase at 3 weeks of age in the
ATN1-FL-65Q, suggesting a change in the status of autophagy
with pathology progression. 
We also biochemically analyzed autophagy on a global scale. 
The extraction process separated a liquid supernatant from a
pellet fraction.  No changes were detected at 3 weeks of age
for GFP-LC3 and p62 in any brain area (Figure S3A).  Thus, the
mild autophagic ﬂux alterations observed at this stage are limited
Figure 1.  Behavioral Assessment of DRPLA Mice
(A–D) Grip strength analysis revealed the progression of degenerative decline in ATN1-FL-65Q mice (red) compared to wild-type mice (WT, black) and ATN1-FL26Q (blue) over time as measured by repeated-measures two-way ANOVA.  This was evidenced by signiﬁcant interaction between age (v1) and genotype (v2) (Xp <
0. 05,XXp < 0. 01, XXXp < 0. 001) when measuring both limbs (A and B).  Hereby the progression was stronger in males signiﬁed by stronger interaction in both limbs
(B) compared to females (A).  In addition, males showed progression when only forelimb grip strength was measured (D).  In contrast, females showed overall
decreased non-progressive grip strength levels for fore limbs (C).  Individual values are given as mean ± SEM and signiﬁcance levels for individual time points are
assigned above with *p < 0. 05, **p < 0. 01, and ***p < 0. 001. 
(E) Thigmotaxis as a measure of anxiety was evaluated for the ﬁrst 5 min after introduction to the open ﬁeld by assessing the time 10-week-old males and females
spent in the outer zone.  The ATN1-FL-65Q (65Q, red) line showed a signiﬁcantly higher tendency to remain close to the walls of the arena as compared to the wildtype (wt; black) and ATN1-FL-26Q (26Q; blue) mice.  Automatic quantiﬁcation using EthoVision 7XT software.  One-way ANOVA, **p < 0. 01. 
(F) General activity was assessed in females at 10 and 14 weeks evaluating the distance traveled from 5 to 25 min after introduction to the open ﬁeld.  ATN1-FL26Q (blue) mice were signiﬁcantly more active compared to the wild-type (WT; black) at 10 weeks.  This difference was more pronounced at 14 weeks of age with
both the ATN1-FL-26Q and ATN1-FL-65Q (red) lines being more active than the wild-type, while ATN1-FL-65Q mice were less active than ATN1-FL-26Q.  An
interaction with age was not observed (repeated-measures two-way ANOVA, v1, genotype; v2, age).  Automatic quantiﬁcation using EthoVision 7XT software. 
One-way ANOVA *p < 0. 05, **p < 0. 01, and ***p < 0. 001. 
(G) In gait analysis at 18 weeks of age, ATN1-FL-26Q shows a typical coordinated and regular footprint placing the hind paws (red) close to front paws (blue).  In
contrast, ATN1-FL-65Q shows an uncoordinated pattern typical for ataxia.

there was a signiﬁcant downregulation of
to the DN of DRPLA mice.  However, pronounced global defects
become apparent at the symptomatic stage.  In the 14 weeks
cerebellum,Atg5-12 conjugate formation and of the GFP-LC3-II/-I ratio (Figures 3A–3C), as well as of GFP-LC3-II (Figures S3C and S3D) in
ATN1-FL-65Q in the supernatant fraction, which was accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase in the cleaved GFP/GFP-LC3 ratio
and of the levels of p62 in the pellet (Figures 3D–3F).  These
changes were also maintained at end-stage (Figure 3G). 
A similar, albeit somewhat delayed, effect to that in the cerebellum was visible in the brainstem lysates of the ATN1-FL65Q line (Figures S3E–S3K).  The ATN1-FL-26Q line appeared
comparable to WT, except for a decrease in the cleaved GFP/
GFP-LC3 ratio at 14 weeks of age (Figures S3I and S3J).  Finally,
no autophagy alteration was detected in the forebrain at any time
point (Figure S3L). 
Despite robust similarities indicating block at lysosomal level
as observed in Drosophila DRPLA models, in DRPLA mice we
detected additional events that indicate the presence of feedback inhibition on autophagy signaling. 
The alterations in the cerebellum at the symptomatic stage
of 14 weeks are consistent with a block in autophagic clearance, combined with a reduction in signaling required for the
formation of new autophagosomes, perhaps result of a feedback loop.  In agreement with this, we detected a reduction
in phosphorylation of Atg13 on S318 (Figure S4A) and a significant decrease in mRNA and protein levels of Tfeb (Figures
3H–3J), the master regulator of the autophagosome-lysosome
system [19].  The feedback loop did not appear to be mediated
by activation of mTOR, which displayed rather a trend toward
inactivation, as shown by phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase
(Figure S4A).  The repression of Tfeb in ATN1-FL-65Q mice is
also indicated by absence from the nucleus of DN neurons
(Figure S4B), and decreased transcription of at least two of
its target genes (Figure 3K).  The ATN1-FL-26Q line showed
almost no difference from WT with the exception of a mild
reduction in the GFP-LC3-II/-I ratio (Figures 3A and 3B) and
GFP-LC3-II (Figures S3I and S3J) at 14 weeks in the cerebellum, as well as a tendency to reduction in mTOR signaling
(Figure S4A). 
To validate whether the stall in autophagy signaling in DRPLA
is present also in human cells, we used ﬁbroblast lines from two
DRPLA patients.  The human ﬁbroblasts failed to respond to
acute 6-hr treatment with the autophagy inducer Rapamycin
(Rap) or with the autophagy clearance blocker Baﬁlomycin A1
(BafA1), whereas a control ﬁbroblast line displayed the typical
increase in LC3I to LC3II conversion, upon Rap treatment, as
well as increased accumulation of LC3II, upon treatment with
BafA1 (Figure 3L).  Chronic 24-hr treatment with BafA1 elicited
a modest but reproducible response from the DRPLA human ﬁbroblasts, including signiﬁcant reduction in LC3I/II conversion
and accumulation of p62 (Figures S4C–S4G), suggesting a
block in autophagosomal biogenesis.  We further conﬁrmed
the block in autophagosome formation in DRPLA cells
with the tandem reporter RFP-GFP-LC3B (Figures 3M and
3N).  The ratio between RFP+ and RFP+/GFP+ positive puncta
in DRPLA cells did not increase with starvation and was also
not affected by additional treatment with BafA1, suggesting
also impaired progression and clearance of the few autophagosomes present (Figure S4H).  Thus, patients’ cells display the
same phenotype detected at late stages in the progression of
cellular pathology in DRPLA mice, i. e. , canonical autophagy
signaling, the formation of new autophagosomes, and their
clearance are stalled.
