Although morphine is a considerably eﬀective and extensive use of
therapy for clinical pain, chronic use of morphine generally leads to
physical and psychological dependence [1,2].  It is well known that
activation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA)
by long-term use of opioids leads to the increase of dopamine release
into the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which is thought to play an important role in opioid reward [3].  Accumulating evidence showed that
acute and chronic treatment with morphine induced a central proinﬂammatory response that contributes to the development of morphine
addiction-related behavior [4].  Morphine-induced neuroinﬂammation
is evidenced by the existence of glial cell activation and proinﬂammatory cytokines release in CNS [5].  Inhibition of glial cell activation in NAc prevented morphine-induced reward eﬀect [6].  Similarly,
cytokines such as TNF-α or IL-6 in CNS are also emerging as the important modulators of addiction-related behavior [7,8].  These results
suggested that inﬂammatory responses in VTA or NAc played an important role in the reward eﬀect of morphine.  Notably, recently studies
showed that opioid via acting on the TLR4 receptor contributed to the
various opioid eﬀects including hyperalgesia, tolerance and dependence [9].  Peer's study further revealed that the binding between
morphine and TLR4/MD2 was also involved in the reward eﬀect of
morphine, while knockout of TLR4 suppressed opioid-induced conditioned place preference [10].  Currently, whether the TLR4 in VTA
participated in the acquisition and maintenance of reward eﬀect following morphine treatment is unclear. 
Accumulating evidences indicated that upregulation of proinﬂammatory cytokine following morphine treatment might result from
the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways [11].  Among
these signaling pathways, Signal Transducers and Transcription Activator 3 (STAT3) pathway is involved in multiple pathophysiological
process of CNS [12].  It has been reported that activation of STAT3 (pSTAT3) in VTA plays a critical role for the integration of motivated

behavior [13], rewarding eﬀects of running and food intake [14,15]. 
However, it remains unknown whether STAT3 signaling pathway in
VTA contributes to the acquisition and maintenance of morphine reward eﬀect.  Additionally, STAT3, as a major mediator of signaling
during immune responses, is involved in multiple steps in adaptive
immune responses [16,17].  Whether the innate immune pattern-recognition receptor TLR4 via activation of STAT3 mediates the acquisition and maintenance of morphine-induced place preference is unclear. 
<Middle> 2.  Material and methods
2. 1.  Animals and drugs
Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g were obtained from
the Institute of Experimental Animals of Sun Yat-Sen University.  Mice
used in this study were adult male animals on a C57BL/6 background
(weight 20–30 g).  STAT3ﬂox/ﬂoxmice (ID: 016923) were purchased from
the Jackson Laboratory.  All animals were housed in separated cages
and the room was kept at 24 °C temperature and 50–60% humidity,
under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and
water.  All experimental procedures were approved by the Local Animal
Care Committee and were carried out in accordance with the guidelines
of the National Institutes of Health on animal care and the ethical
guidelines.  All eﬀorts were made to minimize the number of animals
used and their suﬀering. 
Morphine hydrochloride (7. 5 mg/kg, Qing-hai Pharmaceutical
Factory, Xining, China), TLR4 antagonist LPS-RS (Sigma, USA), STAT3
activity antagonist S3I-201 (Selleckchem, USA), and all other chemicals
were commercially obtained.  The antagonists were ﬁrst dissolved in
DMSO to make a stock solution and were subsequently diluted with
saline to a ﬁnal concentration and the ﬁnal concentration of DMSO was
2%.  The vehicle group received the equal concentration of DMSO correspondence to the each group.  All of the antibodies were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology Co.  (USA), Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.  (USA) or Abcam Ltd.  (USA). 
2. 2.  Injection of adenovirus-associated vector (AAV)
Recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding Cre and GFP marker
(AAV8-Cre-GFP) and AAV encoding GFP (AAV8-GFP) were purchased
from Beijing Vector Gene Technology Company Ltd.  0. 5 μl AAV8-CreGFP was bilateral microinjected into VTA area of STAT3ﬂox/ﬂox mice at
rate of 0. 1 μl/min under the control of a micro-infusion pump.  Injector
glass needles remained in place for 4 ∼ 5 min before being pulled out
to allow the AAV to completely diﬀuse from the tips.  The stereotaxic
coordinates for VTA of mouse were as follows: AP: −3. 44 mm;
ML: ± 1. 1 mm; DV: −4. 6 mm; angle 10° (Paxinos & Franklin, 2001). 
The animals in the control group were injected with the same amount of
AAV encoding GFP (AAV8-GFP).  Morphine was subcutaneously injection on days 21 after the virus injection. 
2. 3.  Surgery and infusion procedures
The rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg,
i. p. ), and permanent guide cannulas (23 gauge) were implanted bilaterally 1 mm above VTA.  The stereotaxic coordinates for VTA was as
follows: AP −5. 04 mm; ML ± 2. 2 mm; DV −8. 2 mm; angle 10° respectively [18].  The cannula was secured by dental cement and anchored to stainless steel screws ﬁxed to the skull.  To prevent clogging
and infection, a stainless steel obturator was inserted into the guide
cannula.  The animals were allowed to recover from surgery for 6 days. 
Infusion were performed with a Hamilton syringe connected to a 30gauge injector (WRD), which was terminated 1 mm below the tip of the
guide cannula.  The drugs were bilaterally infused into VTA over a 60-s
period.  The injection needle was kept in place for 60 s to allow the
drugs to completely diﬀuse from the tips, and then the obturator was
reinserted into the guide cannula [19].  A total of 17 animals were excluded from the ﬁnal analysis due to the misplaced cannulas. 
2. 4.  Conditioned place preferences
The CPP apparatus was used as previously described [6,20].  Brieﬂy,
the test apparatus consisted of a shuttle-box that was divided into two
compartments of same size (30 × 30 × 53 cm3) by a central partition
(1 cm thick) with a door.  One compartment was white with a grid ﬂoor
and the other compartment was black with a smooth ﬂoor.  To minimize
the eﬀect of novelty and stress associated with exposure to the apparatus during morphine CPP, rats were habituated to the apparatus for
15 min for three consecutive days before the pre-conditioning test.  In
the pre-conditioning test (day 0), animals were placed in the white
compartment (non-preferred side) of CPP apparatus and the door was
removed to allow animals with free access to both chambers for 15 min. 
The time spent in each compartment was recorded.  In our experiment,
most of rats exhibited natural preference for the black compartment
(preferred side).  Therefore, we used a biased procedure and selected the
white compartment (non-preferred side) as the morphine-paired side
and the black compartment as the saline-paired side.  The animals
showing strong unconditioned preference (> 800 s) were discarded. 
During conditioning (day 1–5), rats were ﬁrstly injected with saline
subcutaneously in the morning and immediately conﬁned to the black
compartment for 30 min; about 6 h later, the rats were subcutaneously
injected with morphine and immediately placed in the white compartment for 30 min.  On the next day, the animals received morphine
administration in the morning and saline injection in the afternoon.  On
the third and ﬁfth day of conditioning, the same schedule as the ﬁrst
day was repeated.  The schedule on the fourth day was same as that of
the second day.  For the CPP test on day 6, rats were placed in the white
compartment and allowed to move freely between both compartments
for 15 min.  The time spent in the white compartment was recorded for
each animal, and the change of preference was calculated as the difference (in s) of the time spent in the drug-paired compartment (white
compartment) between the postconditioning day and the preconditioning session. 
2. 4. 1.  Acquisition experiment
LPS-RS (0. 1, 0. 5 or 1 μg/μl/side) or S3I-201 (1, 10 or 50 nm/μl/
side) was injected into the VTA 30 min prior to each morphine administration during conditioning.  CPP was evaluated on day 6 of the
experiment as indicated in Fig.  1 (CPP Test 1).  To exclude the potential
eﬀect of inhibitors themselves on the conditioning, LPS-RS or S3I-201
alone was micro-injected into the VTA in the animals conditioned with2. 4. 2.  Expression experiment
Following the acquisition of CPP, the rats received a single intraVTA injection of LPS-RS (0. 5 μg/μl/side) or S3I-201 (10 nm/μl/side) in
Fig 1.  Experimental schedule for the morphine-induced conditioned place preference
task.  Time spent in the white compartments was counted pre-experiment (day 0) for all
groups.  Following 5 days of morphine conditioning phase, CPP was valued on day 6 by
subtracting the time spent in the white compartments post morphine treatment from pre
morphine treatment (CPP Test 1).  To investigate the maintenance of morphine CPP, rats
were returned to home cages for 5 days following CPP induction and the behavioral test
was conducted on day 11. J. -X.  Chen Name

2. 4. 3.  Maintenance experiment
Following the acquisition of CPP, the rats were given daily intraVTA injection of either LPS-RS or S3I-201 in the home cage for another
5 days (day 6–10).  On day 11, the rats were tested for CPP (CPP Test 2,
Fig.  1. )
2. 5.  Histology
After the end of experiments, the animals were immediately anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i. p. ), and then perfused through the ascending aorta with cold heparinized saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.  The intact brain was removed and
post-ﬁxed for 3 h in the same ﬁxative, then stored in 30% sucrose until
sectioning.  Sections (40 μm) were cut on a cryostat, and cannulas placements were assessed under light microscopy.  Dots in Fig.  2A represented the approximate placement of the cannulas in VTA. 
2. 6.  Western blot
Immunoblotting was processed as previously described with minor
modiﬁcations [21].  Brieﬂy, the animals were immediately anesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i. p. ) after the CPP paradigm was
performed.  The brain was removed and sectioned in a cryostat for VTA
(-4. 60 − −5. 04 mm relative to the bregma).  Tissue punches containing
sample area were performed with a 15-gauge cannula and frozen at
−80 °C until used.  Samples were homogenized on ice in 15 mmol/l Tris
buﬀer containing a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors and phosphatase
inhibitors.  Protein samples were separated by gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane.  The blots were placed
in the block buﬀer for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with
primary antibody against STAT3 (1:1000, CST), phospho-STAT3
(1:1000, CST) overnight at 4 °C.  The blots were then incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.  ECL (Pierce)
was used to detect the immune complex.  The bands were quantiﬁed
with computer-assisted imaging analysis system (NIH ImageJ).  β-actin
was used as a loading control.  The experimenter was blinded to all
treatments. 
2. 7.  Immunohistochemistry
Following the behavioral experiments at indicated time points, animals were immediately anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(50 mg/kg, i. p. ) and perfused through the ascending aorta with cold
heparinizedsaline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0. 1 M phosphate buﬀer (pH 7. 2–7. 4).  The brain was removed, post-ﬁxed for 3 h in
the same ﬁxative and stored in 30% sucrose overnight.  Transverse
sections were cut by cryostat and processed for immunohistochemical
staining as previously described [20].  Sections were blocked with 3%
donkey serum in 0. 3% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature, and
then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-TLR4 antibody (1:1000,
Abcam) and anti-TH (1:1000, CST) antibody or anti-phosphorylated
STAT3 (1:1000, CST) antibody.  The sections were then incubated for1 h
at room temperature with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:250)
and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500).  The stained sections
were examined with a Leica ﬂuorescence microscope (Leica, Germany)
and images were captured with a Leica DFC350 FX camera.  All the
experiments were performed by blinded evaluators. 
2. 8.  Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as means ± SEM, and analyzed with SPSS
13. 0 (SPSS, USA).  Western blot data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey post hoc test.  For behavioral test, one-way or twoway ANOVA with repeated-measures followed by Tukey post hoc test
was carried out.  The criterion for statistical signiﬁcance was P < 0. 05. 
The sample size was based on our and peers’ experience in behavioral
studies to provide power analysis. 
3.  Results
3. 1.  Acquisition of morphine CPP was impaired by inhibition of TLR4 in
VTA area
Consistent with our previous study, conditioning with morphine
(7. 5 mg/kg) for ﬁve consecutive days induced signiﬁcant preference for
the morphine-paired compartment compared with saline group, indicating the acquisition of morphine CPP (Fig.  2B).  However, a single
conditioning with morphine induced no preference for the paired
compartment when the behavioral test was performed on the next day
(day 2).  In another experimental group, following 5 days of morphine
administration, the rats were returned to home cages for another 5 days
without any treatment.  Behavioral test on day 11 showed that the rats
still displayed preference for the compartment previously paired with
morphine, suggesting that morphine CPP maintained for at least 6 days
after termination of morphine conditioning (Fig.  2B).  To determine
whether the TLR4 is involved in the acquisition of morphine CPP, the
TLR4 inhibitor LPS-RS was bilaterally microinjected into VTA area
30 min prior to each of morphine treatment during conditioning phase. 
As indicated in Fig.  2, LPS-RS at dose of 0. 5 or 1 μg/1 μl inhibited the
acquisition of morphine CPP compared with DMSO plus morphine
group, while LPS-RS at 0. 1 μg/1 μl had no signiﬁcant eﬀect (Fig.  2C). 
These results suggested that the TLR4 signaling in the VTA area mightJ. -X.  Chen Name

mediate the acquisition of morphine CPP. 
3. 2.  Maintenance, but not expression, of morphine CPP was blocked by
inhibition of TLR4 signaling in VTA area
To determine whether the VTA TLR4 signaling contributes to the
expression of morphine CPP, a single intra-VTA injection of LPS-RS
(0. 5 μg) was administrated 30 min before behavior test on day 6.  The
results showed that LPS-RS did not reduce the conditioning score
compared with DMSO plus morphine group (Fig.  3A).  Next, we determined the role of TLR4 in the maintenance of morphine CPP.  It was
shown that intra-VTA application of LPS-RS for 5 days following CPP
induction blocked the maintenance of morphine CPP (Fig.  3B).  Taken
together, these data indicated that TLR4 signaling in VTA area might
contribute to the maintenance but not expression of morphine CPP. 
3. 3.  Activation of STAT3 induced by chronic morphine treatment is
involved in the acquisition of morphine CPP in VTA
It has been suggested that activation of STAT3 is correlated with the
CNS disease [12].  Therefore, the level of phosphorylated STAT3 in the
VTA was investigated in the present study.  The results showed that the
phosphorylated STAT3 was considerably increased on day 6 and 11
following
Immunohistochemical staining also conﬁrmed that the expression of pacquisition of morphine CPP (Fig.  4A). STAT3 was enhanced on day 6 after treatment of morphine when
compared with that in the control group (Fig.  4B).  To determine whether the activation of STAT3 mediated the acquisition of morphine CPP,
the STAT3 activity inhibitor S3I-201 were bilaterally micro-injected
into the VTA area.  Behavioral test showed that pre-infusion of S3I-201
at dose of 50 or 10 nm/μl, but not 1 nm/μl, before morphine treatment(F(5,66) = 121. 39,
P < 0. 001).  Application of S3I-201 at dose of 10 nm/μl into the VTA
alone did not induce CPP in the saline-paired group (Fig.  4C). 
of morphine CPPacquisition
To further examine the role of STAT3 in the acquisition of morphine, we ﬁrst explored the dose-response analysis for morphine CPP in
mice.  The results showed that morphine at the doses of 12. 5 or 15 mg/
kg, but not 10 and 5 mg/kg, signiﬁcantly increased the conditioned
scores (Fig.  5A).  Next, the recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding Cre and GFP (AAV-Cre-GFP) was bilaterally injected into the
VTA area of STAT3ﬂox/ﬂox mice.  Control mice were injected with AAV
encoding GFP (AAV-GFP).  Twenty one days after virus injection,
marked green ﬂuorescence was observed in TH-positive cells in the
restricted VTA area (Fig.  5B), and PCR and western blot analysis indicated that the expression of both STAT3 protein (Fig.  5C) and mRNA
(Fig.  5D) in VTA area were signiﬁcantly reduced on day 21 following
AAV-Cre-GFP injection into STAT3ﬂox/ﬂox mice.  These results suggested
a high eﬃciency of transfection.  Importantly, conditioning scores was
greatly attenuated in AAV-Cre-GFP-injected STAT3ﬂox/ﬂox mice compared to that of AAV-GFP-injected STAT3ﬂox/ﬂox mice following

repeated morphine conditioning (Fig.  5E). 
3. 4.  Activation of STAT3 is involved in the maintenance, not expression, of
morphine CPP
Next, we examined whether STAT3 activation was also involved in
the expression and maintenance of morphine CPP.  Behavioral results
revealed that single intra-VTA injection of S3I-201 at dose of 10 nm/μl
on 30 min before behavior test on day 6 did not reduce the conditioning
score compared with morphine group (Fig.
