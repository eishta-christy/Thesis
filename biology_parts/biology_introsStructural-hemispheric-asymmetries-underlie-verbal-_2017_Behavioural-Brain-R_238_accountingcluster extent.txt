Cognitive control includes the capacity to enhance the activation of
task-relevant processes while suppressing distracting ones. Stroop paradigm [1], a typical cognitive control task, one has to name
the font color of words and ignore their meaning.  Color naming time
and errors increase when the word color and meaning are incongruent
(e. g. , BLUE written in red) relative to when they are congruent (e. g. ,
BLUE written in blue) or neutral (e. g. , BLUE written in black).  Classical
explanations suggest that, to combat interference during incongruent
conditions, cognitive control processes suppress a habitual reading
mode and activate controlled color naming [2,3]. 
Cognitive control requires the complementary activation of the
anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortex, as demonstrated in
functional neuroimaging studies [4,5].  Speciﬁcally, verbal Stroop-related activations have been observed in the dorso- and ventro-lateral
prefrontal cortex, predominantly in the left hemisphere (e. g. , [6,7]; also
see Ref.  [8], for a recent example of converging neuropsychological
evidence of a left prefrontal involvement in verbal Stroop).  Thus, based
on functional neuroimaging (and neuropsychological) data, one could
hypothesize that a leftward hemispheric asymmetry in the lateral prefrontal cortex helps to combat Stroop interference.  However, left and
right hemispheric activations are not usually compared through direct
statistical tests.  Moreover, a diﬀerent scenario seems to emerge with
structural neuroimaging evidence.  In a recent voxel-based morphometry study, it was found that regional grey matter volume in the
anterior cingulate cortex, cerebellum and, importantly, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was negatively related to the amount of verbal
Stroop interference [9].  Thus, if structural MRI data are taken into
consideration, one could posit diverging expectations regarding which
direction of frontal asymmetry supports better Stroop performance.

is the so-called Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), a word-sensitive region
located in the left inferior posterior temporal cortex [10,11].  Evidence
from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies shows that
activity in the VWFA and Broca's area is modulated by Stroop interference (e. g. , [12]).  Another fMRI study also found diﬀerential activity
in a region proximal to the VWFA in the incongruent vs.  congruent
contrast for a verbal Stroop version but not for a spatial one [13]. 
Collectively, these works corroborate the hypothesis that the VWFA
integrates feed-forward visual processing with top-down inﬂuences
from more anterior areas controlling phonological and semantic processing during written word recognition [14].  The fact that this region
is speciﬁcally involved in the Stroop eﬀect in some studies [12,13],
however, suggests that it could also be more speciﬁcally involved in
cognitive conﬂict resolution, at least for verbal material.  According to a
recent magnetoencephalography study [15], the VWFA is recruited not
only early on for lower-level word processing [16], but also at later
stages for gating lexico-semantic processing (see also Refs.  [17–19]),
arguably the stage where interference occurs in word-color Stroop incongruency. 
The present study aimed to understand whether grey matter structural characteristics in healthy young participants could explain individual diﬀerences in Stroop performance in regions previously found
to be functionally involved in Stroop interference, including the left
lateral prefrontal cortex (e. g. , Broca’s area) and the VWFA.  This goal
was achieved by assessing complementary surface-based measures of
grey matter structure, in particular, cortical thickness and surface area. 
Since relationships between cortical structure and function are still
unclear (e. g. , [20]) and in order to minimize the risk of diluting subtle
regional diﬀerences, we opted for a whole-brain approach instead of
selectively analyzing a priori deﬁned brain regions.  Moreover, given the
strong left lateralization obtained in fMRI studies of verbal Stroop tasks,
we particularly focused on (left vs.  right) brain asymmetries as a possible ﬁne-grained way to explain inter-individual diﬀerences (cf. , [21])
in the performance on this cognitive control task. 
To our knowledge, there is only one recent study [22] that investigated the relationship between structural brain asymmetries and
performance on a Stroop task.  By using voxel-based morphometry, it
was found that a leftward asymmetry in the thalamus was associated
with better performance on a paper-and-pencil version of the Stroop
test, at least in male participants.  However, that study examined a
heterogeneous sample of older adults (mean age: 65. 2 ± 8. 0 years). 
Thus, its results cannot be easily generalized to a healthier and younger
population. 
We additionally employed a spatial version of the Stroop paradigm
(e. g. , [23]) as a “control” task.  The spatial Stroop task could however be
interesting in and of itself.  On the one hand, an association between left
lateralization and the spatial Stroop eﬀect may be predicted as a beneﬁcial role of leftward intrinsic functional lateralization in the middle
frontal gyrus, assessed with resting state electroencephalography
(EEG), has been shown for both the verbal and spatial Stroop eﬀects
[24].  On the other hand, one could envisage mirrored patterns for the
verbal and spatial tasks based on recent neuropsychological literature
showing that the lateralization of prefrontal regions critical for the
performance of conﬂict tasks is domain-dependent [25].  Speciﬁcally, an
increased verbal Stroop eﬀect resulted after left ventro-lateral prefrontal lesions, while the performance on a spatial conﬂict task (i. e. , the
ﬂanker task) was impaired following right ventro-lateral prefrontal lesions (also see Ref.  [6], for recent meta-analytic evidence).

2. 1.  Participants
A total of 111 university students voluntarily took part in the exage = 22. 4 years,
periment
SD = 1. 4 years, range: 19–26 years).  Right-handedness was used as an

inclusion criterion.  This was conﬁrmed for all participants with the
Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Ref.  [27]; mean score = 85. 9,
SD = 15. 3, range: 30–100).  Further, all participants had normal or
corrected-to-normal visual acuity and reported having normal color
vision and no history of any neurological or psychiatric disease.  Participants were compensated for their time and gave written informed
consent prior to participation.  This study was approved by the Bioethical Committee of the Azienda Ospedaliera of Padova, Italy, and the
ethical committee of the Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi
Avanzati (SISSA) in Trieste, Italy. 
2. 2.  Behavioral tasks and procedures
Participants were tested individually on two computerized versions
of the Stroop task, as well as additional tasks not reported here.  The two
Stroop tasks were presented in a counterbalanced order across participants. 
2. 3.  Verbal Stroop
Stimuli consisted of four Italian color words (BLU-blue, ROSSO-red,
VERDE-green, GIALLO-yellow) presented individually in one of four
colors (blue, red, green, yellow).  Participants were asked to ignore the
word and identify the ink color through a button press as quickly and
accurately as possible.  Participants used their index and middle ﬁngers
of both hands to provide the responses; the exact color-to-ﬁnger mappings were counterbalanced across the participants (mapping 1: left
middle-blue,
left index-red, right index-green, right middle-yellow;
mapping 2: left middle-yellow, left index-green, right index-red, right
middle-blue).  Each stimulus was categorized as congruent (e. g. , BLU
presented in blue) or incongruent (e. g. , BLU in red). 
The task consisted of two blocks of 64 trials each with a short break
between the blocks.  Congruent and incongruent trials were randomly
and equally distributed.  To minimize both positive and negative
priming confounds, only complete alternation sequences were employed, meaning that neither the color nor the word presented on trial n
were used in either way (color or word) on trial n + 1 (see Ref.  [26], for
details).  Trials consisted of stimulus presentation in the center of the
screen for 500 ms, a 2000 ms blank response screen, and an additional
blank screen beyond the response time limit, which was jittered randomly and continuously between 250 and 700 ms.  Prior to the experimental blocks, participants completed a training block to ensure
that they understood the task.  This training block was composed of 16
items representing all possible word-color combinations.  Items were
presented on screen until a response was given.  Feedback about accuracy and speed followed the response and lasted on screen for 1200 ms,
followed by a 500 ms inter-trial interval.  Participants moved on to the
experimental blocks after performing at least 10 correct trials out of 16
(one participant repeated the training block twice to reach this criterion). 
2. 4.  Spatial Stroop
This paradigm was similar to that used in previous studies [23]. 
Stimuli consisted of arrows pointing to the upper-left, upper-right,
lower-left, and lower-right corners presented in one of the four quadrants of the screen.  Participants were asked to ignore the position and
indicate the direction of the arrow through a spatially compatible key
press (R, O, V, M) as quickly and accurately as possible by using the
index and middle ﬁngers of both hands.  As in the verbal Stroop task,
stimuli were categorized as congruent (e. g. , upper-right pointing arrow
in the upper-right quadrant) or incongruent (e. g. , upper-right pointing
arrow in the lower-right quadrant).  The details of the task and training
procedures were identical to the ones used in the verbal Stroop task. 
Three participants repeated the training block twice, and another participant repeated it three times to reach the criterion to begin theA.  Vallesi Name
experimental trials (i. e. , 10/16 correct trials). 
2. 5.  Behavioral data analyses
Analyses were conducted to verify the presence of a Stroop eﬀect,
that is, worse performance on incongruent than congruent trials, in the
accuracy and response time (RT) data.  For the accuracy data, Wilcoxon
signed-ranked tests were used to compare the trial types, with the ﬁrst
item of each block excluded.  For the RT data, the ﬁrst item of each
block, error trials and trials following an error, to avoid confounds of
post-error slowing (e. g. , [28]), were excluded.  Additionally, for each
participant, trials with an RT more than 3 standard deviations (SD)
from their individual mean were excluded.  Paired samples t-tests were
used to compare performance on congruent and incongruent trials. 
2. 6.  Neuroimaging procedures
Participants completed a neuroimaging session that included the
acquisition of T1-weighted images, as well as other sequences, which
are not considered here. 
2. 7.  MRI acquisition
Images were acquired for 54 participants on a 3-T Philips Achieva
whole-body scanner at the Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital in
Udine, Italy.  T1-weighted images were acquired using an 8-channel
head coil and a 3D ultrafast gradient echo sequence (TR = 8. 2050 ms,
TE = 3. 78 ms, ﬂip angle = 8°, ﬁeld of view = 240 mm, acquisition

the remaining 57 participants were acquired using a 3-T Philips Ingenia
whole-body scanner with a 32-channel head-coil at the Neuroradiology
Unit, University-Hospital of Padova, Italy.  The scanning parameters for
21 participants of this Padova group were as follow: TR = 8. 1194 ms,
TE = 3. 71 ms, ﬂip angle = 8°, ﬁeld of view = 220 mm, acquisition

2. 8.  MRI data analysis
We used both cortical thickness and surface area as two complementary measures of grey matter microstructure, since they are
genetically and phenotypically independent [29,30], with the surface
area showing more inter-subject variability [30].  Cortical surface area
depends on the number of columns, whereas cortical thickness is inﬂuenced by the number and size of cells within a column, by their
packing density, as well as by the number and myelination level of
connections [31,32].  It therefore follows that cortical thickness and
surface areas should be considered separately, since they are independent neuroanatomical features. 
In our study, surface area and cortical thickness estimations as well
as statistical analysis were carried out using the FreeSurfer software
suite version 5. 3. 0 (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical
School; http://surfer. nmr. mgh. harvard. edu) [33]. 
Image processing
was performed according to the standard pipeline described in previous
publications [34–36].  Brieﬂy, images were registered with an aﬃne
transformation to the MNI305 atlas and resampled to 1 mm isotropic
voxels, corrected for the bias ﬁeld and stripped of the skull.  During this
step, a tessellated ellipsoidal template was deformed into the shape of
the inner surface of the skull taking into account a priori knowledge
about the smoothness of this surface.  The deformed template was then
used to remove all voxels outside the inner surface of the skull from the
MRI volume.  Based on voxel intensity and neighbor constraints, images
were segmented into subcortical white matter and deep gray matterBehavioural Brain Research 335 (2017) 167–173
structures.  Two cutting planes were used to separate the hemispheres
and remove subcortical structures.  This was followed by white matter
surface tessellation and automated topology correction.  The tessellated
white matter surface was used as the starting point during the surface
deformation step, which employed the intensity gradients to optimally
place the gray/white interface and pial surface at the location where
the greatest shift in intensity deﬁned the transition between tissue
classes. 
Cortical thickness was quantiﬁed at each vertex of the cortex as the
shortest distance between the white and pial surface, whereas the area
of a vertex on the tessellated pial surface was deﬁned as the average
area of the triangles of which the vertex was a member.  Following
Greve Name [37], individual right and left hemisphere surface maps
were registered to a symmetric template (fsaverage_sym) by the FreeSurfer spherical registration algorithm.  We then smoothed the maps on
the surface using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width at half-maximum
of 15 mm.  For each subject, the Laterality Indices (LI) for both the
surface area and the cortical thickness at each vertex was computed
according to the formula (L − R)/(L + R) [37]. 
2. 9.  MRI statistical analysis
In the following paragraph, we shall describe the procedure to assess correlations between surface MRI measures and behavioral data. 
First, the mean accuracy data of each participant for the congruent and
incongruent conditions of both the verbal and spatial Stroop tasks were
arcsin square-root transformed to improve normality.  We then took
their diﬀerence as a measure of the accuracy Stroop eﬀect.  The diﬀerences between the mean RT for the incongruent and congruent conditions of both the verbal and spatial Stroop tasks (i. e. , the RT Stroop
eﬀects) were mean-centered with respect to the corresponding mean
value of all the participants.  Statistical surface maps were generated by
contrast analysis based on general linear models (GLM) for the RT and
accuracy Stroop eﬀect measures at each vertex of the cortical surface
model, with either thickness or area LI as the dependent variable. 
Covariates describing the three diﬀerent acquisition procedures were
also added to the GLM.  In order to minimize Type I errors, all the MRI
analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster size
inference by means of the Monte Carlo Null-Z simulation method
adapted for cortical surface analysis, as implemented in FreeSurfer
[38,39].  The null distribution was developed across 10,000 iterations of
simulation.  Only clusters with cluster-wise corrected p-values < 0. 05
with respect to the simulated null distribution were considered as signiﬁcant and reported. 
3.  Results
3. 1.  Behavioral results
Table 1 reports the behavioral results.  The analysis on accuracy data
revealed that, for both the verbal and spatial Stroop tasks, the participants’ performance was signiﬁcantly worse on incongruent than congruent trials, thus resulting in signiﬁcant verbal and spatial StroopPerformance on the verbal and spatial Stroop tasks.

Wilcoxon T = 1223. 5 and 56. 5,

The analyses on the RT data revealed the same pattern of results; for
both the verbal and spatial Stroop tasks, response times were signiﬁcantly longer on incongruent than congruent trials.  Again, this resulted in signiﬁcant verbal and spatial Stroop eﬀects (respectively,
mean = 70 and 105 ms, SD = 55 and 46 ms;
t(110) = 13. 102 and
23. 835, both ps < 0. 001). 
3. 2.  Cortical thickness and surface area results
The analysis on the surface area revealed a cortical region showing a
signiﬁcant relation between the area LI and the verbal RT Stroop eﬀect. 
Fig.  1 shows the corresponding signiﬁcant cluster, corrected for multiple comparisons, resulting from the GLM testing the linear eﬀect of
verbal RT Stroop eﬀect on area LI
(cluster-wise corrected pvalue = 0. 032).  The cluster was located in the middle-posterior temporal lobe (cluster size: 1688. 15 mm2, range: x = −64. 2 to −47. 9,
y = −63. 5 to 28. 3, z = −23. 6 to −0. 4, maximum vertex: x = −58. 4,
y = −48. 0, z = −8. 4, in Talairach coordinates) and was partially
overlapping with the so-called VWFA.  Speciﬁcally, the posterior region
of the signiﬁcant cluster (accounting for approximately 46% of the
cluster extent and including the maximum vertex) overlapped with the
VWFA region identiﬁed by an automated term-based meta-analysis of
98 functional studies performed using Neurosynth (reverse inference
map FDR-corrected at a 0. 01 level; http://neurosynth.
