Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious illness that aﬄicts up
to 10% of the adult population in the United States and represents one
of the leading causes of disability around the world [1].  With an estimated lifetime prevalence of more than 3. 5% in China [2], it is predicted to become the second leading cause of disability by the year
2020 [3].  Aside from mortality associated with suicide, depressed patients are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and type 2
diabetes than non-depressed patients [4]. 
Current treatments of MDD are based on improving clinical symptoms, such as low spirits, lack of lucidity, activity decline, and some
somatic symptoms.  Several eﬀective treatments for depressed patients
have been established, such as cognitive therapy [5], interpersonal
therapy [6], electroconvulsive therapy [7], electrical stimulation of the
vagus nerve [8], and pharmacotherapy with antidepressants.  Drug
therapy is currently the ﬁrst-line treatment.  Many antidepressants have
been approved for the treatment of MDD, such as selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, and norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors.  The
main SNRIs are duloxetine and venlafaxine [9].
