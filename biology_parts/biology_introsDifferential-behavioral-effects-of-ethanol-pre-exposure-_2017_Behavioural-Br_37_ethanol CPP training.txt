Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) measures drug reward, especially the appetitive quality of a reward stimulus that drives the subject
to seek out environmental cues previously paired with a rewarding
substance.  A baseline preference for each conditioned stimulus or CS
(e. g.  environmental context) in the absence of a paired unconditioned
stimulus or US (e. g.  drug) is determined prior to conditioning.  For the
conditioning trials that follow, the US is paired with the initially nonpreferred CS, determined from a baseline preference assessment, according to a biased stimulus assignment procedure.  After conditioning,
a choice test is performed in which both previously conditioned contexts are presented in the absence of the US, and the subject is unrestricted so that it may move between each CS [1].  CPP tasks also
allow for locomotor behavior of the animal to be investigated in the
presence of the rewarding stimulus (US) during conditioning when it is
under the inﬂuence of the drug of interest, compared to behavior in the
reward-paired context (CS), when the drug is not present [2,3]. 
CPP is induced in rodents in response to various stimuli including:
food, water, sweet ﬂuids, conspeciﬁc social stimuli, access to wheelrunning, opportunities to copulate, novel objects, brain stimulation,
and addictive drugs [1,4–8], including ethanol [9].  CPP induction in
zebraﬁsh was ﬁrst reported in a study using cocaine as the US [10].  The
number of stimuli evoking CPP in zebraﬁsh has increased extensively to
also include food, morphine, amphetamine, ethanol, nicotine, and salvinorin A [11–16], all of which also induce CPP in rodents.  CPP in
zebraﬁsh is often induced by a single exposure/conditioning trial,
though increasing the number of conditioning cycles potentiates this
response in a drug-speciﬁc manner [14]. 
A single exposure to ethanol induces dose-dependent CPP in zebraﬁsh at concentrations of 0. 25%, 0. 50%, and 1. 00% [12].  CPP in
zebraﬁsh is also reported in response to 1. 50% ethanol [11,16].  Zebraﬁsh display an U-shaped dose response in locomotor activity when
exposed to (0. 00, 0. 25, 0. 50, or 1. 00%) ethanol [17], while ethanol
induces an inverted U-shaped temporal trajectory of locomotor activity
(distance traveled) [18].  Similarly, adolescent rats receiving ethanol
show divergent behavioral preferences for the same dose of ethanol and
require increased ethanol doses, compared to adults, in order to induce
CPP [19].  However, studies in mice indicate that pre-treatment with
ethanol every 48 h for a week before conditioning does not alter CPP,
but it does sensitize locomotor activation to ethanol [20].  These results
suggest that long-term exposure to ethanol may have additional, potentially confounding eﬀects that impact CPP. 
Diminished predator avoidance occurs in control zebraﬁsh acutely
treated with 0. 50% ethanol or in ﬁsh chronically treated with 0. 25%
ethanol for 2 weeks and then acutely treated with 1. 00% ethanol. 
Chronic 0. 25% ethanol exposure also diminishes hyperactivity in zebraﬁsh receiving 0. 25% or 0. 50% acute ethanol treatment, which the
authors suggest to be a consequence of neural adaptation due to suppression of reinforcing and anxiolytic eﬀects of ethanol by prolonged
alcohol exposure [21].  Alcohol’s anxiolytic eﬀects have been demonstrated in zebraﬁsh in the form of diminished predator avoidance,
startle reaction, inter-ﬁsh distance, and area occupied by a group of
zebraﬁsh [11,21].  In this study, zebraﬁsh undergo a novel tank test
(dive test) and shoaling test directly prior to ethanol CPP training, as
have been used previously to assess trait anxiety in zebraﬁsh [18]. 
Thus, rodents and zebraﬁsh pre-exposed to ethanol display altered
locomotor and anxiety-like behavior at baseline along with altered
behavioral responses to ethanol, suggesting neuroplastic changes.
