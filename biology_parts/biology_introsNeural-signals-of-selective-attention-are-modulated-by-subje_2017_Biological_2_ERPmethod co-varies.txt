Recent evidence has shown that brain activity measured with the
event-related potentials (ERP) method co-varies with preferences for
consumer goods (Junghöfer Name, 2010; Pozharliev, Verbeke, Van
Strien, & Bagozzi, 2015; Schaefer, Buratto, Goto, & Brotherhood, 2016;
Telpaz, Webb, & Levy, 2015).  This is an important development in an
emerging ﬁeld – consumer neuroscience – that aims to investigate
consumer behaviour (CB) with neuroscience methods.
