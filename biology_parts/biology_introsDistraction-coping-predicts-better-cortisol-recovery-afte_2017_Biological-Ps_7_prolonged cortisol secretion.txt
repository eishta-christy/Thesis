Psychosocial stressors such as being exposed to social evaluative
threat have repeatedly been shown to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which plays an important role linking stress
and inﬂammation.  Importantly, chronic exposure to stressful life circumstances is often accompanied by systemic low-grade inﬂammation
which constitutes an antecedent of stress-related disease (Rohleder,
2014), thus illustrating the importance of being able to cope eﬀectively
with everyday stress in order to anticipate adverse health outcomes.  In
light of these relationships, research has focused on coping styles or
traits to explain inter-individual diﬀerences in HPA axis regulation in
order to provide an explanatory approach for individual vulnerability
to pathophysiological consequences of repeated physiological stress
reactions. 
HPA axis activity during stress as characterized by a quick rise and
decline of glucocorticoid levels is thought to be adaptive in terms of
maintaining physiological stability when facing environmental demands.  As described by the allostatic load model (McEwen, 1998;
Sterling & Eyer, 1988) these allostatic processes have a potential cost to
the body, when regulated ineﬃciently or when repeated or chronic
stress requires adaptational reactions to be activated too frequently
(McEwen, 2000; McEwen & Stellar, 1993). 
On the one hand, associations between physiological stress responses and mental and physical health impairments such as major
depression (for a review, see Burke, Davis, Otte, & Mohr, 2005) or
chronic fatigue syndrome (for a review, see Tomas, Newton, & Watson,
2013) have been elucidated cross-sectionally, while prospective studies
revealing a direct path between heightened stress induced HPA axis
responses and disease progression in later life, on the other hand, are
lacking.  However, a prolonged cortisol secretion as a consequence of
repeated or chronic stress experience or to an impaired down-regulation of the HPA axis after stress exposure is thought to prevent the body
from recovering from stress appropriately which leads to suppression of
immune functions (Sapolsky, Romero, & Munck, 2000) as well as increased susceptibility to diseases (Cohen, Janicki-Deverts, & Miller,Promising and indirect evidence arises from longitudinal studies
that account for an increased disease risk among individuals exhibiting
stronger stress-induced increases of inﬂammatory proteins such as interleukin-6 and ﬁbrinogen (Brydon & Steptoe, 2005) as well as greater
