d Time of axon outgrowth directs vagus topographic map
formation independent of hox5
In Brief
The development of topographic maps
classically relies upon spatial patterning
mechanisms.  Barsh Name show that in
zebraﬁsh vagus motor neurons, map
formation is determined by a hox5dependent spatial mechanism that acts in
parallel with a novel temporal mechanism
dependent upon the time of axon
outgrowth.

https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 022Many networks throughout the nervous system are
organized into topographic maps, where the positions
of neuron cell bodies in the projecting ﬁeld correspond
with the positions of their axons in the target ﬁeld.  Previous studies of topographic map development show
evidence for spatial patterning mechanisms, in which
molecular determinants expressed across the projecting and target ﬁelds are matched directly in a point-topoint mapping process.  Here, we describe a novel
temporal mechanism of topographic map formation
that depends on spatially regulated differences in the
timing of axon outgrowth and functions in parallel
with spatial point-to-point mapping mechanisms.  We
focus on the vagus motor neurons, which are topographically arranged in both mammals and ﬁsh.  We
show that cell position along the anterior-posterior
axis of hindbrain rhombomere 8 determines expression of hox5 genes, which are expressed in posterior,
but not anterior, vagus motor neurons.
