Is Friday ‘right’ and Monday ‘left’? Some individuals experience vivid
spatial forms for non-numerical sequences such as the weekdays, and most
would agree on a left-to-right arrangement, at least in Western societies
reading from left-to-right.  In fact, psychological experiments show that the
cognitive representation of sequence includes a spatial component: In
natural sequences such as numbers, months and weekdays (Dehaene,
Bossini, & Giraux, 1993; Gevers, Reynvoet, & Fias, 2003; Gevers,
Reynvoet, & Fias, 2004), but also in just rehearsed artiﬁcial sequences of
random numbers or objects (van Dijck & Fias, 2011), the primary/ﬁnal
items are mentally arranged to the left/right by healthy participants and
corresponding left-hand and right-hand responses are relatively faster in
simple classiﬁcation tasks.  Seeing these resembling behavioral patterns, a
concise theory could assume that the same neurocognitive process underlies the tendency to project all enumerable objects mentally onto space. 
The SNARC eﬀect (spatial-numerical associations of response codes)
oﬀers a reliable and insightful testbed for exploring spatial associations
and the eﬀect was originally observed in judgments of numerical symbols. 
Numerous studies replicated its central ﬁnding of relatively faster left-side
than right-side responding to smaller numbers, and vice versa for larger
numbers (Dehaene Name, 1993; see Wood, Willmes, Nuerk, & Fischer,
2008 for a meta-analysis).  Originally, the SNARC eﬀect was understood as
a long-term spatial representation of numerical magnitude resembling a
mental number line (Pinel, Piazza, Bihan, & Dehaene, 2004; Restle, 1970). 
However, this classical account would assume that a distinct spatial

representations
in the SNARC eﬀect
Notably, although SNARC and SNARC-like eﬀects were documented
for both numerical and non-numerical sequences (Dehaene Name, 1993;
Fias, Brysbaert, Geypens, & D’Ydewalle, 1996; Gevers Name, 2004), sequences such as the weekdays expose a clear ordinal structure with additional cyclic component (Zamarian, Egger, & Delazer, 2007) whereas the
number sequence includes mixed ordinal and cardinal magnitude features. 
For instance, the single-digit ‘2’ could refer to the second item in a row
(ordinality), but the same digit ‘2’ could also imply twice the amount of
something (cardinality).  In contrast, ‘Tuesday’ only refers to the second
day of the week and never implies the summed-up amount of two days.  A
conceptual controversy among numerical cognition researchers regards
therefore the distinction between number magnitude and sequential order
information (e. g. , Fitousi, 2010) and their respective roles in forming(e. g. , Nathan, Shaki,
Salti, & Algom, 2009).  A potentially unifying account was recently promoted by experimentally disentangling the cardinal and ordinal properties
of number: In a delayed working memory (WM) paradigm, participants
were asked to maintain randomized number sequences (e. g. , 4-1-6-8-3)
and performed a SNARC task on the memorized numbers in a delay
period.  In this experiment (and in several follow-up studies), it turned out
that spatial-numerical associations were based on the sequential order and
not on the semantic magnitude information of the numbers (van Dijck,
Abrahamse, Acar, Ketels, & Fias, 2014; van Dijck & Fias, 2011).  This
ﬁnding led to the WM account of the SNARC eﬀect: Here, numbers are
thought to elicit spontaneous adaptations of a general cognitive process to
arrange the present sequence with a spatial layout at the level of WM to
temporarily built an eﬀective (spatial) mental representation (Abrahamse,
van Dijck, & Fias, 2016).  The important contribution of verbal WM to the
SNARC eﬀect was highlighted even before in diﬀerent studies that showed
reversals of SNARC eﬀects by verbal labels positioned at physically incompatible locations (Gevers, Verguts, Reynvoet, Caessens, & Fias, 2006;
Gevers Name, 2010).  Moreover, compatibility eﬀects were observed between the parity concept and spatial responding in the MARC eﬀect
(Berch, Foley, Hill, & Ryan, 1999; Iversen, Nuerk, Jäger, & Willmes, 2006;
Iversen, Nuerk, & Willmes, 2004; Nuerk,
Iversen, & Willmes, 2004;
Schroeder & Pﬁster, 2015).  The assumption of the MARC eﬀect is based on
the principle of markedness: Linguistically, there is a default member in
opposite pairs which is deﬁned by semantic, distributional, or formal
characteristics.  If a classiﬁcation involves stimulus and response features
that share their markedness status, this can lead to faster performance than
when one feature is marked and the other is not.  This behavior can also
account for the standard numerical SNARC eﬀect because response features and verbal magnitude categorization share the marked members
(small-left) or unmarked linguistic members (large-right) in compatible
trials, which usually yield faster responses than incompatible trials.  In less
detail, the verbally mediated categorical correspondence principle is also
compatible with the proposal of polarity correspondence (Proctor & Cho,
2006) and the involvement of verbal circuits for magnitude processing
(Dehaene, Piazza, Pinel, & Cohen, 2003). 
Regarding the underlying functional neuroanatomy, the uniﬁed
theory also invites shifting the focus from the parietal regions bolstering
numerical representations and operations (Cohen Kadosh & Walsh,
2009; Dehaene Name, 2003; Piazza, Pinel, Le Bihan, & Dehaene, 2007)
to prefrontal cortex regions and their contributions to the processing of
sequential order (Marshuetz, Smith, Jonides, DeGutis, & Chenevert,
2000; Shimamura, Janowsky, & Squire, 1990), most likely in conjunction with distributed WM systems (Baddeley, 2000; D’Esposito & Postle,
2015; Hurlstone, Hitch, & Baddeley, 2014).  Furthermore, previous research identiﬁed especially frontoparietal networks for abstract quantity representations in non-human primates, possibly along a hierarchical gradient (Nieder, 2016; Tudusciuc & Nieder, 2009).  Prefrontal
activations were also often found in early neuroimaging studies of
number processing; however, they were often interpreted as subserving
only or predominantly non-numerical processes and were thus not (orless) considered in neurofunctional models (e. g.
