https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 10. 050The mouse retina contains a single type of horizontal
cell, a GABAergic interneuron that samples from all
cone photoreceptors within reach and modulates
their glutamatergic output via parallel
feedback
mechanisms.  Because horizontal cells form an electrically coupled network, they have been implicated
in global signal processing, such as large-scale
contrast enhancement.  Recently, it has been proposed that horizontal cells can also act locally at the
level of individual cone photoreceptors.  To test this
possibility physiologically, we used two-photon microscopy to record light stimulus-evoked Ca2+ signals
in cone axon terminals and horizontal cell dendrites as
well as glutamate release in the outer plexiform layer. 
By selectively stimulating the two mouse cone opsins
with green and UV light, we assessed whether signals
from individual cones remain isolated within horizontal cell dendritic tips or whether they spread across
the dendritic arbor.  Consistent with the mouse’s opsin
expression gradient, we found that the Ca2+ signals
recorded from dendrites of dorsal horizontal cells
were dominated by M-opsin and those of ventral
horizontal cells by S-opsin activation.  The signals
measured in neighboring horizontal cell dendritic
tips varied markedly in their chromatic preference,
arguing against global processing.  Rather, our experimental data and results from biophysically realistic
modeling support the idea that horizontal cells can
process cone input locally, extending the classical
view of horizontal cell function.  Pharmacologically
removing horizontal cells from the circuitry reduced
the sensitivity of the cone signal to low frequencies,
suggesting that local horizontal cell feedback shapes
the temporal properties of cone output. 
INTRODUCTION
Most neurons in the brain have elaborate dendritic arbors
capable of more than simply integrating synaptic input.  Studies
of neurons from different brain regions, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells [1], cortical pyramidal cells [2], hippocampal neurons
[3], and retinal amacrine cells [4, 5], have demonstrated that dendrites can be functionally highly compartmentalized.  Often,
multiple dendritic units can both process synaptic input and
generate synaptic output independently and at a local scale
(reviewed in [6]).  The cellular mechanisms supporting dendritic
processing include anatomical specializations, differential distribution of active channels, and the local restriction of intracellular
signaling (reviewed in [6]).  Moreover, computational work suggests that dendrites can even switch between local and global
signal processing [7].  Such functional compartmentalization of
dendritic arbors greatly increases the computational power of
single neurons and, therefore, that of the brain. 
In the retina, dendritic processing has been mainly studied in
ganglion cells [8, 9] and amacrine cells [4], where dendritic subunits vary dramatically in size and function.  For example, starburst amacrine cell dendritic arbors are divided in sections that
individually compute direction of visual motion [10, 11], while individual dendritic varicosities of A17 amacrine cells provide local
reciprocal feedback to individual rod bipolar cell terminals under
low-light conditions [4].  However, the outer retina also contains a
candidate for dendritic processing, the horizontal cell (HC).  This
is a GABAergic interneuron that provides reciprocal feedback
to photoreceptors and shapes their transmitter release [12–14]. 
The dendrites of HCs contact cone photoreceptors (cones),
whereas their axon terminal system contacts rod photoreceptors
(rods) [15]. 
Traditionally, HCs have been implicated in global processing,
such as contrast enhancement and the generation of antagonistic center-surround receptive ﬁelds (reviewed in [16]).  This is
consistent with the fact that HCs form a gap junction-coupled
network [17], which allows averaging signals across many
cones.  However, recent studies suggest that HCs support also
a local mode of operation and that HC feedback can act at the
level of a single synaptic contact between an HC dendritic tip
and a cone ([14, 18]; for discussion see [19]) (Figures 1A and 1B). 
Here, we test this idea by recording light stimulus-evoked signals at the HC-cone synapse in a slice preparation of the mouse
retina using two-photon Ca2+ [20, 21] and glutamate imaging
[22].  We exploited the particular retinal distribution of mouse
cone types to discriminate between global and local processing:
Mice express two types of cone opsins, a short (S, UV) and a
medium (M, green) wavelength-sensitive opsin.  So-called true
S-cones [23] exclusively express S-opsin and are homogenously

distributed across the retina, while M-cones co-express both
opsins at a ratio that changes from M- to S-opsin dominant along
the dorsoventral axis [24].  Thus, recording at different retinal
locations with different-wavelength stimuli makes it possible to
test if signals of neighboring cones mix in the postsynaptic HC
dendritic process.  We found that cone signals indeed remain
local in the contacting HC dendritic tips, suggesting that HCs
support a local mode of operation.

<Middle> RESULTS. 
Identiﬁcation of Cone Axon Terminals and HC Processes
in the Mouse Retinal Slice
We recorded Ca2+ signals in retinal slices prepared from transgenic mice (Cx57+/cre 3 Ai38; see the STAR Methods).  HC
processes could be identiﬁed in retinal slices by their GCaMP3
expression (Figure 1C).  To identify cone axon terminals, we
bath-applied SR101 [25], which is taken up from the extracellular
solution by the terminals of synaptically very active cells, such as
photoreceptors, during vesicle endocytosis [26].  We conﬁrmed
that the (larger) SR101-labeled structures in the outer plexiform
layer (OPL) were cone axon terminals with slices prepared
from HR2. 1:TN-XL mice [21], in which exclusively cones expressed TN-XL (Figure 1D). 
Light-Evoked Ca2+ Signals in HC Processes
To record light-evoked Ca2+ signals in HC dendritic segments,
we imaged ﬁelds in the OPL while presenting green, UV, or
white light ﬂashes (GUW protocol, STAR Methods) (Figures 1E
and 1F).  The resulting GCaMP3 ﬂuorescence image series was
averaged to anatomically deﬁned regions of interest (ROIs)
(STAR Methods).  We only considered ROIs that responded to
white ﬂashes and fulﬁlled two strict quality criteria, a quality index
(Qi) and a consistency index (Ci) (Figure S1; STAR Methods),
yielding 423 ROIs (4. 3% from a total of 9,912 ROIs) with reliable
light-evoked Ca2+ signals for further analysis (Figures S1B–S1D). 
Because the structural layout of the cone synapse is highly
stereotypical [27], we assumed that ROIs located close to the
cone axon terminal base are likely to be HC dendritic tips, since
this is where they make invaginating contacts with the cones
(reviewed in [19]).  ROIs well above the cone base are expected
to belong mostly to HC axon terminal tips (contacting rods),
whereas ROIs below the cone base should be located on HC primary dendrites [27].  To get an estimate of each ROI’s identity, we
manually determined the base of the cone terminals as a
landmark (solid lines in Figures 1A and 1C–1E) in each imaged
ﬁeld based on SR101 labeling.  We used the sharp transition
between the brightly stained cone axon terminals and the dimmer SR101 labeling below, which likely represented HC dendrites [26].  We estimated the distance (dbase) to the cone axon
terminal base for each ROI.  Responsive ROIs were most
frequent just above the cone axon terminal base (61. 5% ROIs
within 0 < dbase < 5 mm), within the OPL band occupied by
cone terminals.  Here, ROIs had the highest Qi values (Figure S1E)
and the largest light-evoked Ca2+ signals (Figure S1F), suggesting that we could indeed measure responses from HC dendritic
processes in or very close to the cone synapse. 
Mechanisms Underlying Light-Evoked Ca2+ ResponsesTo conﬁrm that the Ca2+ responses were mediated by glutamate
release from photoreceptors, we puff-applied the AMPA/KAtype glutamate receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3dione (NBQX; 200 mM) while presenting white ﬂashes (Figures
2A and 2B).  NBQX signiﬁcantly decreased the Ca2+ baseline
level (F0) in HC processes, and it virtually abolished light-evoked
Ca2+ signals, as indicated by a signiﬁcant reduction in response
amplitude (DF) and area under the curve (FArea) (Figures 2C–2E;
for statistics, see Table 1). 
Earlier experiments on isolated mouse HCs had shown that
intracellular Ca2+ is modulated by inﬂux through Ca2+-permeable
AMPA/KA receptors, L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
(VGCCs), and by release from internal Ca2+ stores [28].  To test
how these pathways contributed to the Ca2+ signals in HC
dendrites, we puff-applied a mixture of AMPA (50 mM) and KA
(25 mM) before and in the presence of blockers (Figure S2).  The
response amplitudes to AMPA/KA puffs alone decreased during
the experiment (Figures S2A and S2C), possibly caused by
downregulation of VGCCs and/or Ca2+ stores due to the strong
pharmacological stimulus.  We estimated this run-down from two
consecutive puffs by calculating the ratio of the response amplitudes (DF2/DF1).  When applying the L-type VGCC blocker verapamil (100 mM) 5 min before the second AMPA/KA puff, DF2/DF1
was signiﬁcantly reduced compared to control (Figures S2A,
S2B, and S2E; for statistics, see Table 1), conﬁrming that VGCCs
contributed to the signals. 
In separate experiments, we tested if
intracellular Ca2+
stores could be involved in amplifying Ca2+ signals in HC
processes.  We bath-applied the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum
inhibitor thapsigargin (5 mM), which
Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA)
blocks Ca2+ store reﬁll and leads to the depletion of Ca2+
stores [28], 20 min before the second AMPA/KA puff.  Thapsigargin decreased DF2/DF1 signiﬁcantly (Figures S2C, S2D, and S2F;
Table 1), suggesting that release from stores contributes to Ca2+
signals in HC dendrites. 
In summary, the observed light-evoked Ca2+ signals in HC
processes result from a combination of Ca2+ sources, in agreement with earlier ﬁndings [13, 28–31].  Moreover, they are modulated by GABA auto-reception (see Figure S3 and Table S1). 
Light-Evoked Ca2+ Signals in HCs Reﬂect the DorsalVentral Opsin Expression Gradient
Next, we recorded HC light-evoked Ca2+ responses at different
locations along the dorsoventral axis of the retina, using the
mouse opsin expression gradient as a tool to speciﬁcally activate
different combinations of S- and M-cones.  While the mouse
retina contains only 5% true S-cones [23], ontogenetic
M-cones in the ventral retina co-express large amounts of
S-opsin and, thus, are functional S-cones [24, 32].  Therefore, if
the spectral preference of the HC Ca2+ signals reﬂects this
gradient, this indicates that cones (and not rods) dominantly
drive these signals and that we are recording from HC dendrites. 
We determined the spectral contrast (SC; STAR Methods) of
each ROI as a function of its location along the dorsoventral
axis (Figure 3).  Consistent with the reported opsin gradient
[32], we found that dorsal HC responses were dominated by
M- and ventral HC responses by S-opsin activation (Figures 3A
and 3B).  ROIs located close to the cone axon terminal base

( 4 % dbase % 4 mm) had signiﬁcantly higher absolute SC
values (jSC-4. +4j = 0. 717 ± 0. 022; mean ± SEM; n = 342) than
ROIs below (dbase <  4 mm, jSC < 4j = 0. 417 ± 0. 045; n = 28;
p = 1. 611$10
(Figure 3C).  This
suggests that the HC distal tips reﬂect the contacted cone’s
chromatic preference and, thus, local signals.  More proximal
dendrites, on the other hand, average across cones, and, thus,
they show spatial integration, in agreement with the funnel shape
of the dbase versus SC plot (Figures 3A and 3B).  In the transitional
zone between dorsal and ventral retina halves, both a UV- and a
green-dominated ROI population co-exist (Figure 3D).  Opsin
immunostaining of slices from this zone conﬁrmed that the distribution of UV and green ROIs reﬂects cone opsin expression
(Figure 3E).  ROIs in the nasal part of the slice were UV sensitive,
and those in the temporal part were green sensitive, consistent
with the transitional zone running at a shallow angle relative to
the naso-temporal axis (Figure 3E, right scheme) [32].  Together,

our data indicate that the activity recorded in ROIs close to the
cone axon terminal base is mostly cone driven and likely reﬂects
activity in HC dendritic tips. 
Local Light-Evoked Ca2+ Signals in HC Dendritic Tips
Next, we assessed if signals from individual cones remain isolated within HC distal dendrites or if they spread across the cells’
dendritic arbors (or the electrically coupled HC network) (Figure 1B).  We looked for recording ﬁelds where neighboring
ROIs had different SC preferences (i. e. , contained ROIs with
SC > 0 and ROIs with SC < 0).  Indeed, this was the case for 15
of a total of 125 recording ﬁelds in both dorsal (5 ﬁelds; Figure 3F)
and ventral retina (10 ﬁelds; Figure 3G). 
To quantify this ﬁnding, we focused on purely UV and green
ROIs (jSCj > 0. 3; 7 ﬁelds, 22 ROIs), and we analyzed the distribution of the lateral distance between each UV ROI and its neighbors (Figure 3H).  We found that UV ROIs clustered in close
proximity (<10 mm) of each UV ROI, suggesting that they are
driven by the same cone, while the majority of green ROIs
3606 Current Biology 27, 3603–3615, December 4, 2017
clustered at larger distances (>10 mm).  The distribution of green
ROIs appeared to be periodic with the average distance approximating that between cone axon terminals (8 mm, cf.  Figures 1C
and 1D), indicating that these (green) ROIs were likely driven by
other cones. 
HC Dendritic Processes Inherit Properties of the
Presynaptic Cone
If HC dendritic tips reﬂect the local cone output, the measured
signals are expected to share properties with the cone signals
(see also Figure S4).  To test this, we presented a colored noise
stimulus (see the STAR Methods), and we measured correlations
between neighboring cone axon terminals and between neighboring HC dendritic tips in the dorsal retina (Figure 4).  If HCs
integrated signals globally, e. g. , by averaging across an HC’s
dendritic arbor or by electrical HC coupling, we would expect a
higher correlation between HC dendritic tips for the two stimulus
classes, due to the lateral signal spread, than for cone axon terminals.  The cone recordings were performed in HR2. 1:TN-XL

mice [21] in which cones expressed the Ca2+ biosensor TN-XL
(cf.  Figure 1D). 
We calculated the linear correlation coefﬁcient (r) between Ca2+
traces from cone ROIs (Figures 4A–4C) in the same recording
ﬁeld, in response to colored noise and to the GUW stimulus. 
Because the noise is a weaker stimulus compared to the GUW
ﬂashes, the correlation between cone terminal responses signiﬁcantly decreased for the noise (Table S2), both when only considering negative transients (Figure 4G) and when comparing whole
traces (Figure 4H).  We repeated this experiment on HCs in
Cx57+/cre 3 Ai38 mice (Figures 4D–4F), and, indeed, like for the
cones, the correlation between HC responses decreased for
colored noise compared to GUW stimulation (Table S2), for negative transients (Figure 4G) and whole traces (Figure 4H). 
A direct comparison between the two sets of experiments is
complicated by several factors that inﬂuence the estimation of
response correlation, including different scan rates for GUW
versus noise stimuli, different biosensors in cones versus HCs,
and different ROI sizes.  Nevertheless, our ﬁnding that noise
stimulation results in a similar (relative) decrease in correlation
for both the pre- (cone) and the postsynaptic (HC) signal
(see Dmedian in Table S2) argues in favor of relatively independent signals and possibly local processing in HC distal dendrites. 
This is further supported by the ﬁnding that nearby HC dendrites
possibly receiving input from the same cone show a higher degree of correlation (correlation between negative events versus
distance for noise: Spearman R =  0. 271, p = 2. 28$10Spearman rank correlation test; n = 1,125; Figure S5). 
We also used the Ca2+ responses to the noise stimulus to estimate the temporal receptive ﬁeld (time kernels, STAR Methods;
[33]).  In cone axon terminals (Figure 4I) and HC dendritic tips
(Figure 4J), the time kernels computed using negative Ca2+ transients (cf.  Figures 4C and 4F) displayed robust positive deﬂections.  Grouping cone ROIs by their spectral preference
(derived from their time kernels; STAR Methods) into green,
UV, and mixed revealed a fraction of 4% UV ROIs (Figure 4I),
closely matching the fraction of S-cones in the dorsal mouse
retina [23].  The averaged time kernels of the different groups
looked similar for cones and HCs (Figures 4I and 4J); cone kernels appeared to be slightly faster, likely due to differences in
biosensor properties (TN-XL: tdecay = 0. 2 s, KD in vitro =
2. 2 mM, from [34]; GCaMP3: tdecay = 0. 23 s, KD in vitro =
0. 66 mM, from [20, 35]).  HC kernels were noisier than those of
cones.  This may be related to differences in ROI area (cones:
9. 6 ± 0. 2 mm2, n = 457 ROIs; HCs: 1. 9 ± 0. 1 mm2, n = 344
ROIs) and, thus, different spatial averaging.  The fact that we
observed UV-selective kernels in HC dendritic tips just as in
cones adds further evidence to the notion that HC dendritic
tips show highly local Ca2+ signals (cf.  Figure 3). 
HC Morphology Supports Electrical Isolation of Distal
HC Dendrites
To test if the HC morphology supports electrically isolating at its
dendritic tips, we built a simple, biophysically realistic model of
a dendritic branch, including synapses with cones based on a
volume reconstruction from electron microscopy (EM) data (Figure 5; see the STAR Methods for details).  First, we stimulated a
single HC dendritic tip by injecting a current at the position of
its synaptic cone contact such that
the tip depolarized
to  25 mV.  We measured the resulting voltage and Ca2+ levels
in all other cone-contacting tips, and we found the membrane
voltage dropping rapidly with distance from the stimulated tip
(Figure 5B).  Only in directly neighboring tips (%15 mm distance),
the depolarization was sufﬁcient to activate VGCCs; however,
even then the resulting Ca2+ increase was two orders of magnitude smaller compared to the stimulated tip (Figure 5C).  We also
traced the voltage change from a stimulated tip to the soma (Figures 5D and 5E), showing that the tips were well isolated from the
rest of the HC’s dendritic arbor.  Finally, we tested if our model
could reproduce the light-evoked Ca2+ signals: We connected
a representative mixture of S- and M-cones to the HC, and we
presented full-ﬁeld light ﬂashes (Figure 5F).  The simulated
voltage responses resembled the Ca2+ signals we observed in
distal HC dendrites in terms of time course and spectral preference diversity (e. g. , Figure 3F).  Therefore, these modeling data
are in line with our experimental data, indicating that the HC

Local HC Feedback May Shape Temporal Properties of
Cone Responses
Finally, we assessed the effect of local HC feedback on the
cone response.  We presented a 60-Hz full-ﬁeld binary noise
stimulus to slices prepared from HR2. 1:TN-XL mice (Figures
6A and 6C) and iGluSnFR-transduced C57BL/6J mice (Figures
6B and 6D) (STAR Methods; [37]).  We estimated time kernels of
Ca2+ signals in cones and glutamate signals in the OPL as
described above (cf.  Figure 4).  The averaged time kernels
were more transient for iGluSnFR in comparison to those for
Ca2+ (Figure 6E), likely reﬂecting differences in signalversus glutamate) and biosensor kinetics (tdecayz200 ms for
TN-XL versus 92 ms for iGluSnFR; [22]).  For further analysis,
we computed the periodograms of the time kernels using
discrete Fourier transforms [14], and we examined the difference in their power spectral density for each frequency component
(STAR Methods; Figure 6F).  We ﬁrst performed two
consecutive recordings with an interval of 5 min as controls. 
No signiﬁcant differences were found between controls for
time kernels from both cone Ca2+ (n = 61 ROIs, 11 slices,
3 mice) and glutamate release (n = 76/15/3).  Next, we deprived
HCs from their input by bath application of NBQX, and we assessed the effect on the time kernels and their corresponding
periodograms for cone Ca2+ (n = 48/15/3) and glutamate
release (n = 47/18/3).  Although the time kernels looked narrower after NBQX application, no signiﬁcant differences were
found between these kernels with respect to time to peak
and FArea.  However, the analysis of the periodograms revealed
a signiﬁcant reduction of the power spectral density at low fre 4, dependent samples
quencies (cone Ca2+, at 1 Hz, p = 3$10
 7, at 1 Hz,
t test; glutamate release, at 0 Hz, p = 3. 2$10
 5), indicating that local HC feedback contributes
p = 4. 7$10
to temporal shaping of cone output by increasing the sensitivity
of the cone signal to low-frequency signal components. 
<Conclusion> DISCUSSION. 
HCs are traditionally thought to play a role in global processing
and to provide lateral inhibition, e. g. , for contrast enhancement
(reviewed in [19]).  Recent studies, however, suggest the existence of a local processing mode, in which HCs provide locally
tailored feedback to individual cones [14, 18], reminiscent of
the local dendritic processing in amacrine cells (e. g. , [4]). 
Here we recorded light stimulus-evoked pre- and postsynaptic activity at the cone-HC synapse in the mouse retina, and
we present three lines of evidence supporting that mouse HCs
can process cone input in a highly local and independent
manner.  First, neighboring dendritic tips, which presumably contact neighboring cones, differed in their chromatic preferences. 
While the ubiquitous GCaMP3 expression in HCs did not allow
us to assign ROIs to individual HCs, it is unlikely that our data
are solely explained by recording two overlapping kinds of
HCs with opposite spectral preference, simply because mice
feature only one type of HC, which indiscriminately contacts all
cones within its dendritic ﬁeld [29, 38].  Second, the correlation
levels of Ca2+ signals measured in neighboring HC dendritic
tips were similar to those recorded in neighboring cone axon terminals.  If cone inputs were already averaged at the level of the
distal HC dendrite, we would have expected an increase in correlation from cones to HCs.  Hence, our correlation data support
local signaling (and possibly processing) in HC dendritic tips. 
Third, a simple, biophysically realistic model conﬁrms that the
HC morphology supports electrical isolation between dendriticBy isolating HCs pharmacologically from their cone input, we
showed that the HC feedback may shape the temporal ﬁltering
properties of the cone synapse, i. e. , by modulating the power
at low-stimulus frequencies.  Taken together, our study extends
the traditional view of global HC signaling by a powerful local
component, indicating that dendritic processing already happens at the ﬁrst synapse of the retina. 
Local versus Global HC Feedback
Byzov and Shura-Bura [39] were ﬁrst to suggest that HCs provide local feedback to cones.  Following experimental conﬁrmation, it was then proposed that both local and global feedback
are triggered by the activation of AMPA/KA receptors on HCs
[18], but with local feedback being mediated by the local Ca2+
in the dendritic tip and global feedback relying on depolarization
and possibly ampliﬁcation by VGCCs [40].  While we did not ﬁnd
interactions between distal HC dendrites, the mixing of S- and
M-signals we observed in proximal HC dendrites hints at some
degree of global signal integration.  We cannot exclude the possibility that the slice preparation introduces a bias toward local
signaling; however, earlier work in rabbit HCs suggests that local
feedback suffers more from slicing than global feedback [18]. 
Furthermore, more global-scale interactions have been successfully demonstrated in mouse retinal slices; these include,
for instance, lateral inhibition between cones [12] and electrical
coupling within the AII amacrine cell network [41].  Global signal
integration within the HC network requires Cx57-mediated
gap-junction coupling [17].  In the Cx57+/cre 3 Ai38 mice used
here, one Cx57 allele is replaced by a cre gene, resulting in a
reduced Cx57 expression.  The HCs in these mice feature smaller
receptive ﬁelds (RFs) and elevated resting potentials; but, since
HC coupling is intact and cone-HC synapses seem unaltered
[42], we do not expect this genetic modiﬁcation to substantially
affect our conclusions. 
Mechanism(s) of Local Ca2+ Signaling in HC Dendrites
What is the cellular basis of the local Ca2+ signaling we observed
in HC dendrites? In line with previous studies [28, 29, 31], we
show that these signals are mediated by a combination of
(G and H) Average correlation per ﬁeld for events only (G) and full Ca2+ traces (H) for cones and HCs in response to green, UV, and white (GUW) light (cones, n = 6
ﬁelds; HCs, n = 60 ﬁelds) and to colored noise (cones, n = 65 ﬁelds; HCs, n = 57 ﬁelds). 
(I and J) Normalized time kernels of green ROIs (amplitude green kernel > 2 SD noise, left), UV ROIs (amplitude UV kernel > 2 SD noise, middle), and mixed ROIs

Ca2+-permeable AMPA/KA-type glutamate receptors, VGCCs,
and Ca2+ released from stores.  This combination is reminiscent
of another reciprocal synapse with local signaling, the synapse
between rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and A17 amacrine cells [43]. 
Here, Ca2+ enters a dendritic amacrine cell (AC) varicosity via
AMPA receptors and triggers GABA release, with the necessary
ampliﬁcation of the Ca2+ signal generated by Ca2+-induced Ca2+
release from stores.  To keep the signal from spreading to neighboring varicosities, A17 cells express Ca2+-activated potassium
(BK) channels that hyperpolarize the varicosity and suppress the
activation of VGCCs.  In addition, varicosities are spaced with an
average distance of 20 mm along the dendrite to increase electrical isolation. 
Local signaling in HCs may employ a similar mechanism.  (1)
As shown for several species, local HC feedback can be triggered by AMPA receptor activation without requiring VGCCs
[18].  If this is also true for mouse HCs is still unclear.  The
Ca2+ signals evoked by AMPA/KA puffs mainly involved
L-type VGCCs and Ca2+ stores; but, for weaker, more physiological stimuli (i. e. , light), the direct contribution of AMPA/KA
receptors to the Ca2+ signals may be greater, as it seems to
be the case in A17 cells [43].  Moreover, activity of VGCCs in
HCs is suppressed by dopamine, which is released in a lightdependent
fashion [44], suggesting that VGCCs contribute
less to the Ca2+ signal under our light conditions.  (2) HCs express BK channels that limit membrane depolarization in a
voltage- and Ca2+-dependent manner [45].  (3) Ca2+ signals in
HC dendrites partially rely on Ca2+ stores [28].  (4) The HC
morphology enhances electrical
isolation between dendritic
tips, as supported by our modeling data.

Do Rods Contribute to the Ca2+ Signals in HC Dendrites?
The transgenic mouse expresses GCaMP3 in all HC compartments, and because dendritic and axonal HC processes are intermingled, we could not distinguish them solely based on their
morphological appearance.  Yet, our conclusions rely on the
assumption that the measured Ca2+ signals reﬂect cone input
and that rod input (either mediated by direct rod-HC contacts
or by rod-cone coupling) can be neglected.  We think that this
was the case for three reasons.  (1) We measured the largest
Ca2+ signals at the OPL level where HC dendrites invaginate
the cone axon terminal base [19, 27].  (2) The chromatic tuning
of these Ca2+ signals reﬂected the local ratio of S- versus
3612 Current Biology 27, 3603–3615, December 4, 2017
M-opsin expression along the retina’s dorsoventral axis.  If rods
had substantially responded to either UV or green, we would
have expected an additional UV response in dorsal HCs and/or
an additional green response in ventral HCs.  (3) Laser-evoked
photoreceptor excitation alone generated a background illumination equivalent to 104 P*$s
 1/cone (STAR Methods; [32]),
which is probably similar in rods [25].  Electrical recordings
from mouse rods in slices indicate that rod photoresponses
disappear at 104 P*$s
 1/rod [46], suggesting that rods were
not operational under our stimulation conditions.  Our earlier
ﬁnding that RBCs respond to light-on stimuli under similar conditions [37] may be explained by direct (or indirect) cone input
to RBCs, as in mice 70% of the RBCs contact at least one
cone [47], and cones and rods are at least weakly coupled at
our light levels [48]. 
Functional Consequences of Local Dendritic Processing
for HC Feedback to Cones
What could be the purpose of local HC feedback to cones? Our
pharmacological data indicate that (local) HC feedback boosts
low-frequency signals in the cone output, consistent with a
general role of HC feedback in dynamically shaping/adapting
the time course of cone transmission, e. g. , as a function of
stimulus conﬁguration (e. g. , center versus surround stimulation;
[49, 50]).  Speciﬁcally, our ﬁnding is consistent with earlier work
showing that activation of HCs (by a dark annular stimulus)
shifts the frequency sensitivity of an HC in the stimulus center
toward lower frequencies [51].  That we could not also ﬁnd a
shift at higher frequencies may well be due to temporal
limthe imaging system and the biosensors
itations both of
(cf.  Results). 
In theory, the objective of sensory neurons is often considered to be the relative enhancement of relevant information
content from a sensory input, given a limited metabolic capacity [52].  Adaptational mechanisms allow the circuitry to robustly
meet this objective despite changing natural scene statistics
[53], whether by enhancing features (increasing information
content) or removing redundancy (reducing metabolic cost). 
For HCs, these elements have typically been considered for
adaptation to spatial properties, through mechanisms such as
the center-surround RF and background luminance subtraction.  Here, the local adaptation we observed appears to operate in the time domain; the effect is made visible by changes
in sensitivity to (at least but probably not solely) low-frequency
components, which might convey little information content in
natural scenes where they are strongly present and more information otherwise.  In this sense, local feedback may serve temporal contrast enhancement.  That the feedback can occur at
the level of individual photoreceptors is perhaps not surprising,
as such a cell driven in isolation is still subject to trade-offs in
information and metabolic cost.  In natural scenes, spatial and
temporal statistics are not independent, and the interplay between their
respective adaptational mechanisms, such as
here the potential interplay between local and global feedback
mechanisms in HCs, is an attractive subject for further study
(see discussion in [19]).  A promising approach to tackle these
questions may be a combination of voltage biosensors [54] to
probe the voltage distribution across an HC’s dendritic arbor
with biophysically realistic models.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILSFor the Ca2+ imaging experiments in retinal horizontal cells (HCs), we crossed the transgenic mouse lines Cx57cre/cre [31]
and B6;129S-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm38(CAG-GCaMP3)Hze/J (Ai38) [20], yielding Cx57+/cre x Ai38 mice, which express the Ca2+ biosensor
GCaMP3 [35] under the control of the promoter for the gap junction-forming connexin57 (Cx57) selectively in HCs.  For Ca2+ imaging
in cone axon terminals, we used the HR2. 1:TN-XL mouse line [21], which expresses the FRET-based Ca2+ biosensor TN-XL [57]
exclusively in cones.  TN-XL enables ratiometric Ca2+ measurements by determining the ratio between the signals of its two ﬂuorophores, eCFP (FRET donor) and citrine (FRET acceptor), which are linked by the Ca2+ sensor troponin C (for details, see [21]).  For
glutamate imaging, iGluSnFR [22] was ubiquitously expressed in the retina after intra-vitreal virus injection in C57BL/6J mice (see
Virus injection).  We observed iGluSnFR expression predominantly in HCs, likely because bipolar cells express AAV constructs
less efﬁciently [58].  Both male and female adult mice (4-18 weeks of age) were used.  Animals were deeply anesthetized with isoﬂurane (CP-Pharma, Germany) and killed by cervical dislocation.  All procedures were performed in accordance with the law on animal
protection (Tierschutzgesetz) issued by the German Federal Government and approved by the institutional committee on animal
experimentation of the University of Tu¨ bingen, Germany. 
METHOD DETAILS
Retinal tissue preparation
For all imaging experiments, mice were dark adapted for at least 2 hr and then killed.  Under dim red light, both eyes were marked at
the ventral side to maintain retinal orientation, quickly enucleated, and hemisected in carboxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2) extracellular
solution with (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2. 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1. 25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 20 glucose, 2 CaCl2, 0. 5 L-glutamine and 150 mM
pyridoxal 5-phosphate (a cofactor of the glutamic acid decarboxylase [59]) (Sigma-Aldrich or Merck, Germany).  Cornea, lens and
vitreous body were carefully removed.  The retina was separated from the eye-cup, cut in half, ﬂattened, and mounted photoreceptor
side-up on a nitrocellulose membrane (0. 8 mm pore size, Millipore, Ireland).  Using a custom-made slicer [60], acute vertical slices
(300 mm thick) were cut parallel to the naso-temporal axis.  Slices attached to ﬁlter paper were transferred on individual glass coverslips, ﬁxed using high vacuum grease and kept in a storing chamber at room temperature for later use.  For all imaging experiments,
individual retinal slices were transferred to the recording chamber, where they were continuously perfused with warmed (36carboxygenated extracellular solution containing 0. 5 mM sulforhodamine 101 (SR101; Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) to visualize cone
axon terminals. Virus injection
Before the injection of AAV9. hSyn. iGluSnFR. WPRE. SV40 (Penn Vector Core, PA, USA), mice (5-7 weeks) were anaesthetized with
10% ketamine (Bela-Pharm GmbH, Germany) and 2% xylazine (Rompun, Bayer Vital GmbH, Germany) in 0. 9% NaCl (Fresenius, Germany).  A Hamilton syringe (syringe: 7634-01, needle: 207434, point style 3, length 51 mm, Hamilton Messtechnik GmbH) containing
.  Then, 1 ml of the virus
the virus was ﬁxed on a micromanipulator (M3301, World Precision Instruments, Germany) at an angle of 15
was injected into the naso-ventral part of the vitreous body [37].  Recordings were performed 3 weeks after the injection. Two-photon imaging
Ca2+ and glutamate signals were recorded on a customized MOM-type two-photon microscope (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA;
designed by W.  Denk, MPI for Neurobiology, Martinsried, Germany) [25, 61], equipped with a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser
(MaiTai-HP DeepSee; Newport Spectra-Physics, Germany) tuned to either 860 or 927 nm for TN-XL and GCaMP3/iGluSnFR excitation, respectively, and a 20x water-immersion objective (XLUMPlanFL, 0. 95 NA, Olympus, Germany, or W Plan-Apochromat
20x/1. 0 DIC M27, Zeiss, Germany).  Two PMTs with appropriate band-pass ﬁlters were used to detect the ﬂuorescence emission
of (a) TN-XL/citrine, GCaMP3 (538 BP 50, AHF, Germany) or iGluSnFR (510 BP 84), and (b) TN-XL/eCFP (483 BP 32) or SR101
(630 BP 60).  We acquired time-lapsed image series with the custom software ScanM (by M.  Mu¨ ller, MPI for Neurobiology, and
T.  Euler) running under IgorPro 6. 37 (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA).  Images of 128 3 64 pixels (51. 8 3 28. 2 mm or
38. 7 3 20. 8 mm) at a frame rate of 7. 8125 Hz were recorded for all visual stimuli except the ‘‘coloured noise’’ and binary noise stimuli
(see below), where we used images of 128 3 16 pixels (51. 8 3 7. 1 mm or 38. 7 3 5. 2 mm, at 31. 25 Hz; Figure S1A).  Recording ﬁelds
were always located at the outer plexiform layer (OPL) to prevent bleaching of the cone outer segments by the scanning laser [21, 32]. 
Because SR101 is endocytosed by terminals of synaptically active cells such as photoreceptors [26], we performed control experiments to rule out that SR101 ﬂuorescence in the ‘‘red’’ channel contributed to the activity signals measured in the ‘‘green’’ channels. 
To this end, we presented light ﬂashes to retinal slices from C57BL/6 mice bathed in SR101 and recorded the ﬂuorescence signal in
Current Biology 27, 3603–3615. e1–e5, December 4, 2017 e2
both channels.  Indeed, we did not ﬁnd any light stimulus-dependent signal modulation in the red channel (data not shown).  Furthermore, we did not detect any substantial SR101 ﬂuorescence in the green channel. 
Light stimulation
Full-ﬁeld light stimuli were generated by two band-pass-ﬁltered LEDs (UV, 360 BP 12; green, 578 BP 10; AHF) driven by an opensource microprocessor board (http://www. arduino. cc) and synchronized with the scanner retrace to avoid light stimulus artifacts during image acquisition.  The light from the two LEDs was combined by a beam-splitter (400 CDLP, AHF) and focused on the retinal slice
through the bottom of the recording chamber via a condenser lens (H DIC, 0. 8 NA, Zeiss).  The intensity of each LED was adjusted
such that the photoisomerisation (P*) rate in S-cones elicited by the UV LED was equal to the P* rate elicited by the green LED in
M-cones [62, 63].  The light intensity generated by each LED was equivalent to P* rates (in P*s-1/cone) ranging from 0. 5$103 (IMIN)
to 6. 5$103 (IMAX) for all stimuli except the binary noise stimulus (IMIN = 0. 6$103, IMAX = 19$103), where a different light stimulator
was used (for details, see [37]).  Note that the two-photon excitation laser caused an additional steady background illumination
(IBKG) of approx.  104 P*s-1/cone [21, 32], which likely amounts to a similar P* rate in rods [25].  Under these stimulus conditions, it
is unlikely that rods are operational (see Discussion). 
Note that we use the term ‘‘white’’ to refer to the simultaneous stimulation with both LEDs with the same P* rate.  All following 5 stimulus protocols were preceded by a 15 s period that allowed the photoreceptors adapting to the background (IMIN + IBKG):
(a) A white ﬂash protocol consisting of 1 s bright ﬂashes (from a background of IMIN to IMAX) of ‘‘mouse-white’’ (both LEDs on)
at 0. 2 Hz.  This protocol was used to assess drug effects on light-evoked Ca2+ responses. 
(b) A color ﬂash protocol consisting of bright green, UV and white 1 s ﬂashes (‘‘GUW’’) at 0. 2 Hz and repeated 10 times for each
color (same intensity levels as for (a)).  This protocol was used to determine the spectral contrast (SC, see below) preference. 
(c) A contrast and color ﬂash protocol consisting of 1 s bright and dark ﬂashes, with the respective LED combinations (green, UV,
and white) at IMAX or IMIN, respectively, at 0. 2 Hz and repeated 8 times for each condition (Intensity between ﬂashes: 3$103
P*s-1/cone).  This protocol was used to determine the SC and the dark-light index (DLi, see below). 
(d) A ‘‘coloured noise’’ stimulus protocol consisting of a 25 Hz pseudo-random sequence of green, UV, white, and dark ﬂashes. 
This protocol was used to probe correlation between neighboring cones and HC processes and to calculate time kernels
(see below). 
(e) A binary noise stimulus protocol consisting of a 60-Hz pseudo-random sequence of dark and bright ﬂashes.  This protocol was
also used to calculate time kernels. Immunohistochemistry
After two-photon imaging, a subset of retinal slices were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0. 1 M phosphate-buffered salineC for 15 min.  Slices were then washed in 0. 1 M PBS, and submerged in blocking solution (0. 1 M PBS, 0. 3% Triton X-100,
(PBS) at 4
C with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-M-opsin
10% donkey serum) over night at 4
(1:1,000) from EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; goat anti-S-opsin (1:500) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Germany) in 0. 1 M PBS,
0. 3 Triton X-100, and 5% donkey serum.  The following day, slices were washed in 0. 1 M PBS and incubated with the secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 (1:1000) and donkey anti-goat conjugated to Alexa Fluor 660 (1:1000),
both Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).  Image stacks (15 frames of 1024 3 1024 pixels, 15 mm Z-steps) were acquired on a confocal
laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP8, Germany) which was equipped with green (552 nm) and far-red (638 nm) lasers and a
10x 0. 3 NA objective lens (Leica).  Maximum-intensity projections of the image stacks were performed using Fiji (http://ﬁji. sc/Fiji). C.  Afterward, slices were incubated for 4 days at 4Pharmacology and drug application
All drugs were prepared as stock solutions in distilled water or, in the case of thapsigargin, in DMSO (0. 1% in the extracellular
medium), and were stored at  20
C.  Before each experiment, drugs were freshly diluted from stock solution in carboxygenated
extracellular solution.  For puff application, a glass electrode (tip diameter: 1-2 mm) was placed approx.  100 mm above the recorded
region of the slice and drug solution was puffed for 10 s using a pressure application system (0. 2-1 bar, Sigmann Elektronik GmbH,
Germany).  The lateral spread of the puff was about 200 mm in diameter, as measured by pufﬁng a ﬂuorescent dye (SR101).  For bath
application, the tissue was perfused with the drug added to the bathing solution for 5 min or, in the case of thapsigargin, for 20 min
(perfusion rate of 1. 5 mL/min).  For puff application, the following concentrations were used (in mM): 200 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3dione (NBQX), 50 a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), 25 kainic acid (KA), 100 muscimol and 100
SR-95531 hydrobromide (gabazine).  For bath application, we used (in mM): 100 verapamil, 5 thapsigargin and 100 NBQX.  All drugs
were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, England) except for KA, which was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 
Data analysis
To analyze light-evoked Ca2+ signals in HCs and cones, as well as glutamate release in the OPL, we used custom-written scripts in
IgorPro (Wavemetrics) and SARFIA [55].  For GCaMP3 and TN-XL ﬂuorescence (Ca2+ in HCs and cones, respectively), regions-of-interest (ROIs) were anatomically deﬁned using SARFIA’s automatic Laplace operator feature on the averaged, ﬁltered image series
and manually corrected if required (e. g. , if two nearby structures shared one ROI); ROIs with an area < 10 pixels were discarded. 
e3 Current Biology 27, 3603–3615. e1–e5, December 4, 2017
For iGluSnFR ﬂuorescence (glutamate release), the correlation over time between neighboring pixels was measured and ROIs were
determined based on a correlation threshold (deﬁned for each recording depending on the signal-to-noise ratio).  ROI diameters were
limited to range between 5 to 8 mm (diameter of a cone axon terminal). 
To determine the spatial resolution of our system, we measured the point spread function (PSF) using ﬂuorescent beads (0. 17 mm in
diameter; Invitrogen) and found the resolution (Abbe) limited to 0. 6 mm in the x-y plane and 4. 1 mm along the z axis (FWHM of Gaussian
ﬁt, green channel).  Cone axon terminals measure approx.  5 mm in diameter, distal HC dendrites between 1 to 2 mm [38].  Therefore,
both can be resolved in the x-y plane.  Due to the limited z resolution, it is possible that a ROI averaged across multiple ﬁne distal HC
dendrites stacked along the z axis.  In case of the much larger cone axon terminals, averaging across two stacked ones is unlikely but
cannot be excluded.  In any case, however, since such averaging is not expected to increase functional diversity between individual
ROIs, it should not have affected our conclusions. 
To estimate each ROI’s ‘‘vertical’’ position within OPL, the positions of cone axon terminals were visualized using SR101 ﬂuorescence (Figures 1C and 1D).  Here, cone axon terminals can be identiﬁed because they are more brightly stained compared to rod axon
terminals and HC processes, and because they are organized along the OPL like beads on a string.  A ROI’s distance to the cone axon
terminal base (dbase) was estimated relative to a manually drawn straight line tracing the base of all cone axon terminals in a recorded
ﬁeld, using the shape transition in brightness between the cone axon terminals and the weakly labeled HC dendrites below as a
landmark. 
For TN-XL, the ratio between acceptor (citrine) and donor ﬂuorescence (eCFP) was calculated on the image series, prior to signal
extraction.  For all indicators, time traces were extracted for each ROI, de-trended by high-pass ﬁltering at 0.
