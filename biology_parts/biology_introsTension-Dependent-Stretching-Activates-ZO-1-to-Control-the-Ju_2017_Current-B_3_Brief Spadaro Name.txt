In Brief
Spadaro Name use super-resolution
microscopy to show that ZO-1, a protein
that connects tight junction membrane
proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, exists
in either stretched or folded
conformations, depending on
actomyosin-dependent force, resulting in
changes in the localization, stability, and
downstream signaling of its interactors. 
Highlights
d The tight junction protein ZO-1 exists in stretched and folded
conformations
d Actin organization, myosin activity, and heterodimerization
control ZO-1 conformation
d The stretched conformation of ZO-1 recruits DbpA and
occludin to junctions
d Barrier function and proliferation are controlled by
actomyosin through ZO proteins
