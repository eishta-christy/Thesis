Weight gain and obesity are a great health concern of the modern
Western world, in both Europe (Berghöfer Name, 2008) and the US
(Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, & Curtin, 2010) obesity has reached a prevalence of 30%.  Emotional eating, which is overeating during stress or
negative aﬀect seems to be an important factor in weight gain while it
increases food intake of speciﬁcally high fat and/or sweet foods
(Gibson, 2012; Greeno & Wing, 1994; Schepers & Markus, 2015).  The
cause of this unhealthy habit has not decisively been determined, although over the last years in both cognitive and biological scientiﬁc
ﬁelds this topic has been explored extensively.  For instance diﬀerences
in behavioral disinhibition (Guerrieri Name, 2007), attention bias
(Shafran, Lee, Cooper, Palmer, & Fairburn, 2007), restrained eating
styles (Greeno & Wing, 1994), heightened responses of reward areas of
the brain towards food related cues (Bohon, Stice, & Spoor, 2009) and
genetics (Keskitalo Name, 2008; Sung, Lee, Song, Lee, & Lee, 2010;
Tholin, Rasmussen, Tynelius, & Karlsson, 2005) all seem to partly explain emotional eating.  A system that is greatly involved in stress
resilience and therefore might play an important part in emotional
eating is the brain serotonergic (5-HT) system.  Dysfunction of this
neurotransmitter is associated with decreased stress resilience and increased intake of carbohydrate rich foods (Markus, 2008).  The serotonin transporter gene contains a polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) that inﬂuences availability of serotonin transporters thereby inﬂuencing 5-HT
eﬃcacy.  Carrying an S-allele of this gene (opposed to an L-allele) causes
increased hormonal and behavioral stress responsiveness (Gotlib,
Joormann, Minor, & Hallmayer, 2008; Markus & De Raedt, 2011;
Markus & Firk, 2009; Mueller, Brocke, Fries, Lesch, & Kirschbaum,
2010), greater brain responses to fearful stimuli (Hariri & Holmes,
2006; Murphy Name, 2013) and increased chances of aﬀective disorders
in response to stressful life events (Karg, Burmeister, Shedden, & Sen,
2011; Miller, Wankerl, Stalder, Kirschbaum, & Alexander, 2013).  There
is indirect support for this gene’s inﬂuence on emotional eating as an Sallele is associated with overweight and obesity (Erritzoe Name, 2010;
Sookoian Name, 2007) and also seems to mediate the eﬀect of stressful
events on the incidence of eating disorders (Di Bella, Catalano,
Cavallini, Riboldi, & Bellodi, 2000; Fumeron Name, 2001).  However

direct associations between this allele and bodyweight are not always
reproduced (Hinney Name, 1997; Racine, Culbert, Larson, & Klump,
2009; Sundaramurthy, Pieri, Gape, Markham, & Campbell, 2000), suggesting that its role in emotional eating is more contributing than deterministic.  Ancillary to brain 5-HT function, stress vulnerability also
depends on cognitive evaluation of
stressful events
(Folkman & Lazarus, 1988).  A possible important interacting cognitive
factor in 5-HTTLPR’s eﬀect on emotional eating is neuroticism.  Neuroticism is a personality trait that inﬂuences the frequency and intensity(Kendler, Kuhn, & Prescott, 2004;
Luteijn & Bouman, 1988).  This cognitive stress vulnerability seems to
play a role in the eﬀect of 5-HTTLPR on eating behavior while particularly S/S-carriers who score high on neuroticism show an increased
body mass index (BMI) (Markus & Capello, 2012).  However a 5-HTTLPR by neuroticism interaction on food intake could not be found in
response to a natural (Capello & Markus, 2014a) or experimental
(Capello & Markus, 2014b) stressor.
