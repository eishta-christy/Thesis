https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 003Considerable evidence implicates the basal ganglia
in interval timing, yet the underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood.  Using a novel behavioral
task, we demonstrate that head-ﬁxed mice can be
trained to show the key features of timing behavior
within a few sessions.  Single-trial analysis of licking
behavior reveals stepping dynamics with variable
onset times, which is responsible for the canonical
Gaussian distribution of timing behavior.  Moreover,
the duration of licking bouts decreased as mice
became sated, showing a strong motivational
modulation of licking bout initiation and termination. 
Using optogenetics, we examined the role of the
basal ganglia output in interval timing.  We stimulated a pathway important for licking behavior, the
GABAergic output projections from the substantia
nigra pars reticulata to the deep layers of the superior
colliculus.  We found that stimulation of this pathway
not only cancelled licking but also delayed the initiation of anticipatory licking for the next interval in a
frequency-dependent manner.  By combining quantitative behavioral analysis with optogenetics in the
head-ﬁxed setup, we established a new approach
for studying the neural basis of interval timing. 
INTRODUCTION
Time perception is unique because there are no dedicated sensory organs or receptors for time.  The brain appears to create the
subjective sense of time by integrating a variety of sensory inputs
and internal states [1].  Many studies have implicated corticobasal ganglia networks in interval timing in the seconds to minutes range [2–5].  However, it remains unclear how basal ganglia
output contributes to timing behavior. 
Traditional studies examining interval timing have two major
limitations.  First, the behavioral methods are time consuming
and yield results that are difﬁcult to interpret.  For example,
operant procedures using lever pressing as the behavioral
readout are commonly used across many species [6]. 
Training typically takes months and produces complex stereotyped behaviors between lever presses.  Second, techniques
commonly used in animal timing studies, like lesion, electrical stimulation, and pharmacological manipulations, cannot
precisely manipulate speciﬁc neuronal populations and neuroimaging timing studies in humans rely on correlational
analyses of brain activity and behavioral data [4, 7].  To overcome these limitations, we designed a novel task for studying
interval timing in head-ﬁxed mice during optogenetic manipulation of deﬁned neuronal populations.  Using a ﬁxed time
schedule of reinforcement, we trained mice to exhibit accurate timing behavior within a few hours.  Mice rapidly showed
licking behavior that peaks at the expected time of reward
delivery in accordance with previous studies using lever
presses as a behavioral measure [8, 9].  Licking on this task
can be precisely quantiﬁed and shows the hallmarks of interval timing. 
Licking is also a behavioral measure with well-characterized
neural circuits [10–12].  Previous work demonstrates the importance of a cortico-basal ganglia circuit, including the ventrolateral striatum and lateral substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in
orofacial behavior [10, 13].  In particular, a subset of GABAergic
projections from the SNr to the deep layers of the superior
colliculus (SC)
is critical for the initiation and termination of
self-paced licking behavior [10, 14].  The basal ganglia output
regulates SC neurons in regulating licking bouts.  The SC output,
in turn, regulates central pattern generators in the brainstem to
generate orofacial and other movements [15, 16]. 
Optogenetic stimulation of
the nigrotectal pathway can
directly terminate licking behavior by uniformly increasing
inhibition of tectal projection neurons, thus disrupting descending motor commands [10].  By stimulating channelrhodopsin
(ChR2)-expressing GABAergic projection neurons in the SNr,
we could uniformly increase SNr output and interfere with the
normal pattern of nigrotectal signaling, which is time locked to
the licking bout [17].  Using this procedure combined with quantitative behavioral analysis, we examined the contribution of the
basal ganglia output to interval timing behavior in mice.

In agreement with previous work in freely moving mice [10],
voluntary licking behavior was highly stereotyped, consisting of
bouts of rhythmic protrusion and retractions of the tongue at a
relatively ﬁxed rate (6–10 Hz) for both anticipatory and consummatory licking [17].  After training, all mice showed anticipatory
licking prior to each reward delivery (Figure 1C, left), starting
4–6 s before the reward and peaking at roughly the expected
time of reward delivery.  Consummatory licking stopped 2–4 s
after the reward delivery.  As the mouse became sated during
the session, anticipatory licking gradually decreased and
consummatory licking decreased more abruptly (Figure S1).  After training, all mice showed anticipatory licking prior to each
reward delivery (Figure 1C, left), starting 4–6 s before the reward
and peaking at roughly the expected time of reward delivery. 
Peak Probe Trials
After 5–10 days of training on the ﬁxed-time task, peak probe
trials were introduced (Figure 1B, right).  During these trials,
reward delivery was omitted, followed by an extended period
of no reward delivery.  Probe trials lasted for 30–40 s and were
randomly inserted with 20% probability.  Mice readily learned
this peak procedure with maximal response rates occurring
around 10 s (i. e. , the expected reward time) within a few days
(Figure 1C, right). 
A hallmark of interval timing is the spread in timing of behavior
scales linearly with the temporal duration being timed.  This ‘‘scalar property’’ is analogous to the Weber-Fechner law in psychophysics [1].  To test whether mice also exhibit the scalar property
using our novel behavioral paradigm, three mice were trained on
the peak procedure with two additional intervals: 7. 5 and 15 s
(Figure 2A).  All mice tested were highly accurate in timing these
intervals (Figure 2B; 7. 5-s condition: 8. 09 ± 0. 10 s; 10-s condition: 10. 33 ± 0. 14 s; 15-s condition: 15. 26 ± 0. 19 s; n = 13 for
each condition; 3–5 sessions for each duration for three mice). 
Performance on these three durations was normalized by the
peak response time and maximum lick rate and then superimposed across all three intervals (Figure 2C).  The resulting data
clearly demonstrate the scalar property (Figure 2D; 7. 5-s condition: 0. 55 ± 0. 04; 10-s condition: 0. 56 ± 0. 03; 15-s condition:
0. 59 ± 0. 02; n = 13 for each condition; 3–5 sessions for each
duration for 3 subjects).  This result establishes that the headﬁxed peak procedure is a powerful method that not only expedites training but also produces results with the essential
features of interval timing behavior. 
Stepping Dynamics and Motivational Modulation of
Licking Behavior
To reveal ‘‘single-trial’’ dynamics of the licking behavior [17, 19],
we analyzed behavioral data during each interval using statistical
methods previously used for ﬁtting latent dynamical spike-train
models [19].  Our analysis revealed that behavior during the
ﬁxed-time-schedule task is well described by a ‘‘stepping’’
model for both the start and end of the licking bout (Figures 3A
and 3B).  In other words, the licking behavior displays stepping
dynamics with variable step onset and offset times.  In accordance with traditional lever-pressing data from rodents, the canonical Gaussian distribution found on peak trials, a key feature
of interval timing behavior, is a product of averaging many trials. 
This conclusion is in agreement with a recent study that found

Behavioral Performance
Mice were trained on a 10-s ﬁxed-time-schedule task (Figures
1A and 1B, left).  Head-ﬁxed mice voluntarily licked a blunt-tipped drinking needle placed in front of their mouth that delivered
a 10% sucrose solution every 10 s.  A solenoid connected to an
Arduino slaved to a custom-written MATLAB Psychtoolbox
scripts controlled sucrose delivery.  No external conditioned
stimulus was presented.  Individual
licking contacts between
mice and the drinking needle were recorded with a contact
lickometer [18].

similar stepping dynamics in the lever-pressing behavior of
rats [20]. 
Our single-trial analysis also made it possible to analyze how
changes in internal states during a single session affect timing
behavior [21].  Early in the session, when water-deprived mice
were highly motivated, licking started earlier and ended later
with higher rates (Figure 3C).  As mice became sated, anticipatory licking and bout duration gradually decreased, but the
center of the bout, which reﬂects the expected timing of the
reward delivery, did not change signiﬁcantly.  Bout duration
was strongly modulated by motivational state (n = 10 mice;
p < 0. 05, unpaired t test), but the peak of the licking response
was not (Figure 3D; n = 10 mice; p > 0. 05, unpaired t test). 
Thus, motivational state has a strong impact on the variance
of timing behavior.  Traditionally, data from the entire session
are used to analyze the peak and variance.  Because the
observed variance can be partly attributed to motivational modulation, traditional methods systematically underestimate the
precision of timing behavior. 
Effect of Nigrotectal GABAergic Pathway Stimulation onWe previously showed that optogenetic stimulation of the SNrSC GABAergic pathway disrupts self-paced licking behavior by
uniformly increasing inhibition of deep/intermediate-layer tectal
neurons and interfering with motor commands from SNr neurons
[10].  To examine the function of the SNr-SC GABAergic pathway
in timing, we expressed Cre-dependent ChR2 bilaterally with
AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP in the lateral SNr of
Vgat-IRES-Cre mice (Vgat::ChR2 SNr-SC; n = 6) and targeted
the axon terminals in the lateral SC with optic ﬁbers (Figures
4A–4C and S2). 
We used 3 different stimulation protocols to compare the effects of stimulation at different times during the interval: (1) 2 s
to 1 s before reward delivery; (2) 1 s before reward delivery;
and (3) 1 s after the reward delivery.  We also varied the stimulation frequency in each condition: 10, 25, 50, and 100 Hz.  Stimulation of nigrotectal projections signiﬁcantly reduced the number
of licks for the duration of the stimulation in a frequency-dependent manner (Figure 4D; n = 6 mice; p < 0. 05, one-way ANOVA
with post hoc Tukey test).  In agreement with previous work
[10], this result shows that the nigrotectal pathway is important
for both anticipatory and consummatory licking. 
We conducted slice experiments to conﬁrm that photo-stimulation of SNr neurons can evoke spiking in a frequency-dependent manner.  Using the same stimulation frequencies and pulse
width, we showed that SNr neurons were able to follow the pulse
train at high frequencies (Figures 5A and 5B; n = 4 mice).  Spike
ﬁdelity was nearly perfect up to 50 Hz.  At 100 Hz, although
more spiking was produced than at 50 Hz, the spiking could
not follow the stimulation pulse train perfectly, showing a ceiling
effect.  In our experiments, perfect spike ﬁdelity is not necessary
so long as there is a frequency-dependent effect of stimulation. 
In fact, the evoked ﬁring rate at different stimulation frequencies

from our slice experiments could explain the behavioral data
from Figure 4 very well.  Using the evoked spiking from the slice
experiments as estimates of in vivo activation of the nigrotectal
pathway, we examined the relationship between spiking and
suppression of licking.  Estimated SNr spiking, based on results
from slice experiments, could account for most variance in the
suppression of licking behavior (Figure 5C; r2 > 0. 90, p < 0. 001
in each).  Thus, higher nigrotectal output results in stronger suppression of licking. 
To test whether nonspeciﬁc effects of laser stimulation or
infection contributed to the reduced licking rate duringstimulation in Vgat::ChR2SNr-SC mice, we injected Vgat-IRESCre mice (n = 5) with an AAV-Flex-eYFP control vector (Vgat::
eYFPSNr-SC).  Under the same experimental conditions, laser
stimulation in the absence of ChR2 had no effect on licking
behavior (Figure S3; n = 6 mice; p > 0. 05, one-way ANOVA). 
Interestingly, photo-stimulation of nigrotectal GABAergic projections at 100 Hz not only transiently suppressed licking but also
altered the timing ofVgat::ChR2 SNr-SC mice (Figure 6A).  Based on the ﬁtting of the
stepping model by the single-trial analysis, we could deﬁne the
start and end of the licking bout on each peak probe trial. 
the response on the nextPhoto-stimulation 1 s after the reward signiﬁcantly delayed the
licking bout on the next trial (Figure 6B; n = 5; p < 0. 05, unpaired
t test).  Photo-stimulation 1 s before the reward signiﬁcantly delayed the center of the bout (peak) and start of the bout (Figure 6C; n = 5; p < 0. 05, unpaired t test).  Yet stimulation at an
earlier point (2 s to 1 s) before the reward delivery resulted in
an earlier peak (Figure 6D; n = 5; p < 0. 05, unpaired t test; Figure S4).  Furthermore, when the stimulation frequency was lowered to 50 Hz 1 s after the reward condition, signiﬁcant delays
in consummatory licking were still evident in three of the four
mice, whereas shifts on subsequent peak trials were only found
in a single mouse (p < 0. 05, unpaired t test; data not shown). 
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the resetting/pausing effect on peak trials is not due to delays in the termination of consummatory licking.  Cancelation of the current
licking bout is relatively independent of the delay in the next
bout of licking. 
Photo-stimulation 1 s after the reward is thus most effective at
delaying consumption licking (Figures 6 and S3; n = 5; p > 0. 05,
unpaired t test).  There was no correlation between the end
time of the consumption licking and start/end of the licking
bout in both stimulation or no stimulation conditions (Figure S5;

r2 < 0. 10, p > 0. 05).  These results indicate that the nigrotectal
GABAergic projection is also critical
timing behavior. 
Under the same experimental condition, photo-stimulation in
the absence of ChR2 expression in control animals (5 Vgat::
eYFPSNr-SC mice) had no effect on peak test performance (Figure 6; n = 5; p > 0. 05, unpaired t test). 
<Conclusion> DISCUSSION. 
We designed a novel behavioral task for studying interval timing
in mice.  Compared with the traditional freely moving operant
approach, this procedure has three major advantages: (1) by
eliminating complex behavioral sequences observed in freely
moving animals, the behavioral measure was simpliﬁed, allowing
focus on central timing mechanisms with a clearly deﬁned and
quantiﬁable behavioral readout; (2) behavioral training, which
only takes a few days, is more efﬁcient than traditional operant
procedures, which require months of training for the standard
peak procedure; and (3) mice display all the hallmarks of interval
timing, such as the scalar property.  Taking advantage of the
above features, we used optogenetics to interrogate the role of
a deﬁned neural pathway in timing. 
Using quantitative modeling of single-trial behavior, we show
that licking behavior can be described by a stepping model
[19].  The apparent Gaussian distribution of
the behavioral
timing function from peak trials is a result of averaging data
from many trials with variable step onset and offset times
[20].  The start and stop times on peak trials are of particular interest because they reﬂect the animal’s moment-to-moment
estimate of when the reward will arrive on each trial.  All animals
tested showed a ‘‘peak’’ around the timing of the target duration (Figures 2A and 2B).  The variance is also proportional to
the time interval (Figures 2C and 2D).  This scalar property, a
hallmark of interval timing, is thought to be analogous to the
Weber-Fechner law, which has been characterized for other
sensory modalities [4]. 
Traditional timing studies often rely on the ‘‘peak response,’’
which is a result of averaging behavior from many trials.  The
gradual ramping pattern of the anticipatory behavior could be
an artifact of averaging [20], creating a misleading picture of
the underlying mechanisms [22].  Our single-trial analysis produces a more accurate depiction of timing behavior.
