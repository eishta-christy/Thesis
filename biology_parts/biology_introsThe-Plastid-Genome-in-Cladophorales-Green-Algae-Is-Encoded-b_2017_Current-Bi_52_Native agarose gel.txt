In Brief
Del Cortona Name describe intriguing
features of the plastid genome of
Cladophorales, which is fragmented into
linear ssDNA molecules that fold into
hairpin conﬁgurations due to the
presence of inverted repeats.  This
architecture is unprecedented among
eukaryotes, and highlights unexpected
variation in plastid genome structure.

https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 004Virtually all plastid (chloroplast) genomes are circular double-stranded DNA molecules, typically between 100 and 200 kb in size and encoding circa
80–250 genes.  Exceptions to this universal plastid
genome architecture are very few and include the
dinoﬂagellates, where genes are located on DNA
minicircles.  Here we report on the highly deviant
chloroplast genome of Cladophorales green algae,
which is entirely fragmented into hairpin chromosomes.  Short- and long-read high-throughput
sequencing of DNA and RNA demonstrated that
the chloroplast genes of Boodlea composita are
encoded on 1- to 7-kb DNA contigs with an exceptionally high GC content, each containing a long inverted repeat with one or two protein-coding genes
and conserved non-coding regions putatively
involved in replication and/or expression.  We propose that
these contigs correspond to linear
single-stranded DNA molecules that fold onto themselves to form hairpin chromosomes.  The Boodlea
chloroplast genes are highly divergent from their
corresponding orthologs, and display an alternative
genetic code.  The origin of this highly deviant chloroplast genome most likely occurred before the
emergence of the Cladophorales, and coincided
with an elevated transfer of chloroplast genes
to the nucleus.  A chloroplast genome thatcomposed only of linear DNA molecules is unprecedented among eukaryotes, and highlights unexpected variation in plastid genome architecture. 
INTRODUCTION
Photosynthetic eukaryotes possibly originated 1. 9 billion years
ago following an endosymbiotic event in which a heterotrophic
ancestor of the Archaeplastida engulfed a cyanobacterium that
became stably integrated and evolved into a membrane-bound
organelle, the plastid [1, 2].  Following this primary endosymbiosis, an intricate history of plastid acquisition via eukaryoteeukaryote endosymbioses resulted in the spread of plastids to
distantly related eukaryotic lineages [3]. 
Plastids have retained a reduced version of the genome inherited from their cyanobacterial ancestor.  A core set of genes
involved in the light reactions of photosynthesis, ATP generation,
and functions related to transcription and translation is typically
retained [4].  Many genes have been lost or transferred to the nuclear genome and, as a result, plastids are dependent on nuclear-encoded, plastid-targeted proteins for the maintenance
of essential biochemical pathways and other functions such as
genome replication, gene expression, and DNA repair [5].  Nearly
all plastid genomes consist of a single circular-mapping chromosome, typically between 100 and 200 kb and encoding circa
80–250 genes [4, 6].  Diversity in size, gene content, density,
and organization of plastid genomes among different eukaryotic
lineages [7–9] is by and large limited, especially when compared
to mitochondria. 
Whereas fragmented mitochondrial genomes evolved several
times independently during the evolution of eukaryotes [8, 10],
fragmented plastid genomes are only known in dinoﬂagellates
[11] and a single green algal species [12].  In peridinin-containing
dinoﬂagellates,
the chloroplast genome is fragmented into
DNA minicircles of 2–3 kb, most of which carry one gene only
[11, 13].  Larger minicircles of up to 12 kb have also been
described [14], as well as minicircles containing two genes [15]
and ‘‘empty’’ minicircles without genes [16].  The genes located
on these minicircles mostly encode key components of the major
