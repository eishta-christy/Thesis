Prenatal riskNonreciprocal action of the parasympathetic (PNS) and sympathetic (SNS) nervous systems, increases susceptibility to emotional and behavioral problems in children exposed to adversity.  Little is known about the PNS and
SNS in interaction with early adversity during infancy.  Yet this is when the physiological systems involved in
emotion regulation are emerging and presumably most responsive to environmental inﬂuences.  We examined
whether parasympathetic respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and sympathetic pre-ejection period (PEP) response and recovery at six months, moderate the association between cumulative prenatal risk and physical
aggression at 20 months (N = 113).  Prenatal risk predicted physical aggression, but only in infants exhibiting
coactivation of PNS and SNS (i. e. , increase in RSA and decrease in PEP) in response to stress.  These ﬁndings
indicate that coactivation of the PNS and SNS in combination with prenatal risk is a biological marker for the
development of aggression. andbiological
Exposure to adversity during the prenatal period, such as maternal
psychiatric problems, substance (ab)use, single parenthood and poverty, has been shown to predict aggression in childhood that persists
into adolescence
and adulthood (Côté, Vaillancourt, LeBlanc,
Nagin, & Tremblay, 2006; Hay Name, 2011; NICHD Early Child Care
Research Network, 2004).  Yet, not all children seem to be equally affected by adversity.  Guided by theories of diﬀerential susceptibility
(Belsky & Pluess,(Boyce & Ellis, 2005), a number of studies have demonstrated that individual diﬀerences in stress reactivity, as measured by indices of the
cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS), can predispose or protect
against the eﬀects of adversity on children’s behavioral maladjustment
(e. g.  El-Sheikh & Erath, 2011).  Although these studies provide important insights into physiological measures of susceptibility, they have
focused mostly on older children.  Little is known about the role of the
cardiac ANS in interaction with early adversity during infancy when the
physiological systems involved in emotion regulation are emerging and
presumably most responsive to environmental inﬂuences (Beauchaine,
Neuhaus, Brenner, & Gatzke-Kopp, 2008; Laurent, Harold, Leve,
Shelton, & Van Goozen, 2016).

Altered ANS functioning has been consistently linked to aggression
in children,
(Van Goozen, Fairchild,
Snoek & Harold, 2008).  The ANS is comprised of a sympathetic (SNS)
and adults
adolescents
and parasympathetic (PNS) branch.  PNS activity is often assessed by
respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA).  RSA is the heart rate variability at
the frequency of respiration (Cacioppo, Uchino, & Berntson, 1994), and
is considered to index the neural control of the heart via the vagus
nerve (Porges, 2007).  During restful periods, the vagus exerts an inhibitory inﬂuence on the heart acting as a ‘brake’ by increasing vagal
output to the sino-atrial (SA) node of the heart and limiting sympathetic
inﬂuences which contribute to a slow and steady heart rate.
