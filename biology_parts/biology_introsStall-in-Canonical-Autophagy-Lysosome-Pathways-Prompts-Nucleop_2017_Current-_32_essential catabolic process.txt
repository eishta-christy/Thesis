In Brief
Golgi-mediated degradation and
excretion of LaminB1 promote cell
atrophy and death.  Baron Name
demonstrate that a block in canonical
autophagy signaling leads to activation of
alternative clearance routes.  Golgimediated degradation and excretion of
nuclear LaminB1 ﬁnally result in terminal
nuclear breakdown, cell atrophy, andBaron Name, 2017, Current Biology 27, 3626–3642

The terminal stages of neuronal degeneration
and death in neurodegenerative diseases remain
elusive.  Autophagy is an essential catabolic process frequently failing in neurodegeneration.  Selective autophagy routes have recently emerged,
including nucleophagy, deﬁned as degradation of
nuclear components by autophagy.
