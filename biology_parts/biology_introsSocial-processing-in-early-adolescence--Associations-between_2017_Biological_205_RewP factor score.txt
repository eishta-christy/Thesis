Examining dimensions of social processing at multiple levels of
analysis (e. g. , self-report, behavior, physiology, circuits) has the potential to inform understanding of both typical and atypical development (e. g. , Morris & Cuthbert, 2012).  Yet, measurement of social processes, such as aﬃliation and attachment (National Institute of Mental
Health, 2017), poses unique challenges for multi-method assessment. 
That is, special consideration is needed in order to develop methods
that simulate real-world social interactions while also allowing for the
collection of levels of data that require specialized equipment (e. g. ,
electroencephalogram [EEG] or functional magnetic resonance imaging
[fMRI]). 
Adolescence marks a period of increasing importance of peer relationships and the development of more supportive, close friendships
(Steinberg & Morris, 2001).  In addition, risk for many internalizing
disorders increases in adolescence (Costello, Egger, & Angold, 2005;
Kessler, Avenevoli, & Ries Merikangas, 2001), and extensive data support a connection between social processes and the development of
both depression and anxiety.  For example, positive peer relationships
appear protective against the development of symptoms, whereas interpersonal stressors, including maladaptive social interactions, peer
victimization, and loss of relationships are consistently linked to risk for
internalizing symptoms (Hammen, 2005; Hawker & Boulton, 2000; La
Greca & Harrison, 2005; Vrshek-Schallhorn Name, 2015). 
There has been growing interest in tasks to assess social processes in
youth at the neural level.  Some of the earliest work on brain circuits
used the Cyberball task, a computerized ball-tossing game that elicits
reactivity to social exclusion Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams, 2003;
Williams, Cheung, & Choi, 2000), with more recently developed fMRI
tasks involving the exchange of personal information and pretense of
more direct feedback from peers.  For example, in the Chat Room task,
participants rate how interested they are in participating in an online
chat with peers, and then receive feedback regarding whether those
peers were interested in chatting with them (Guyer Name, 2008).  In the
Social Network Aggression Task, participants are told that peers reviewed their personal proﬁles, and then receive positive, negative, and
neutral feedback on their proﬁles, followed by the chance to retaliate
against simulated peers (Achterberg Name, 2017).  In the Virtual School
Paradigm, participants create personal proﬁles and avatars that they
then use to interact live with simulated peers who direct both positive
and negative evaluative comments to the participant (Jarcho Name,
2016).  Findings from these task have begun to reveal circuits involved
in social feedback processing, including regions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), insula, striatum and
amygdala (Achterberg Name, 2017; Guyer, Choate, Pine, & Nelson,

Though still in the early stages, evidence from neuroimaging suggests that social feedback tasks may be useful for examining altered
social processing in relation to depression and anxiety in youth.  For
example, youth with major depressive disorder (MDD) have been
shown to exhibit altered patterns of neural activation to rejection in the
Chat Room Interact task (Silk Name, 2014), and preliminary evidence
indicates that youth at risk for depression show blunted responses to
social acceptance in reward processing regions such as the ventral
striatum (Olino, Silk, Osterritter, & Forbes, 2015).  There is also some
evidence to suggest that anxiety and anxiety risk are associated with
altered patterns of brain activation during anticipation and receipt of
negative peer feedback (Jarcho Name, 2013, 2016; Lau Name, 2012), and
social feedback tasks may be particularly relevant to the development
of social anxiety (Jarcho Name, 2013). for

applicationsbe
(Banaschewski & Brandeis,Nelson & McCleery, 2008).  Yet, little work has examined EEG measures
of social feedback processing in youth.  The reward positivity (RewP),
also known as the feedback negativity, is an ERP component that appears as a relative positivity in response to positive or rewarding
feedback compared to negative feedback approximately 300 ms after
feedback over frontocentral sites (Foti, Weinberg, Dien, & Hajcak, 2011;
Gehring & Willoughby, 2002).  In monetary reward tasks, RewP is reliably assessed across development (Bress, Meyer, & Proudﬁt, 2015) and
correlates with activation in reward-related brain regions, including
ventral striatum and mPFC (Becker, Nitsch, Miltner, & Straube, 2014;
Carlson, Foti, Mujica-Parodi, Harmon-Jones, & Hajcak, 2011), as wellreward sensitivity
(Bress & Hajcak, 2013).  RewP to monetary rewards appears to be altered in those higher in internalizing symptoms, with evidence of a
blunted reward response in youth with elevated symptoms of depression and some evidence of an enhanced RewP in children with elevated
symptoms of social anxiety (Bress Name, 2015; Kessel, Kujawa,
Proudﬁt, & Klein, 2015). 
and behavioral measures of
self-report
We developed a novel task called Island Getaway to measure ERPs
including RewP to social acceptance and rejection feedback in youth
(Kujawa, Arfer, Klein, & Proudﬁt, 2014).  During the task, participants
vote to reject and accept simulated co-players, while also receiving a
combination of rejection and acceptance feedback from peers.  To simulate real
life interactions, participants and co-players exchange
personal information (e. g. , photograph, likes/dislikes, and interests)
throughout the task, and participants are led to believe that peer
feedback may be based on this information.  Following the task, participants complete a self-report measure of task engagement.  Our initial
pilot study (N = 19) indicated that an enhanced RewP was observable
following social acceptance feedback, a pattern that has also been observed in adult studies of social feedback processing (Dekkers, van der
Molen, Moor, van der Veen, & van der Molen, 2014; van der Molen,
Dekkers, Westenberg, van der Veen, & van der Molen, 2016).  Moreover,
our preliminary correlations indicated that this task may be useful for
examining eﬀects of depression and social anxiety on social feedback
processing.  Though these eﬀects were limited by the small sample size,
greater socieal anxiety symptoms correlated with a larger RewP to acceptance feedback, and greater depressive symptoms were associated
with a trend for a blunted RewP to acceptance (Kujawa, Arfer Name,The goals of the current study were to replicate and extend our
previous ﬁndings in a large sample of young adolescents (N = 412) and
reﬁne methods for applying ERPs to understanding social processes
across development.  Given limited data on ERPs to social feedback in
youth, our ﬁrst goal was to use principal components analysis (PCA) to
identify distinct components sensitive to social feedback and to bettercharacterize the timing and scalp distribution of the RewP in response
to social feedback.  Building on our previous work (Kujawa, Arfer Name,
2014), our second goal was to evaluate correlations between neurophysiological measures of sensitivity to social feedback (i. e. , RewP),
self-report (i. e. , task engagement), and behavioral measures (i. e. , tendency to reject peers) from the Island Getaway task.  Our ﬁnal goal was
to test the relevance of these measures to individual diﬀerences by
examining correlations with symptoms of depression and social anxiety.

2. 1.  Participants
Participants were part of a larger community sample of children
initially recruited when the children were 3 or 6 years old (Kujawa,
Proudﬁt, & Klein, 2014; Olino, Klein, Dyson, Rose, & Durbin, 2010). 
Participants were invited back to the laboratory when they were approximately 12 years old and completed a series of EEG tasks in a
counterbalanced order (descriptions and results of other tasks will be
presented in future manuscripts).  A total of 439 youth completed the
social feedback task.  Informed consent was obtained from all parents
and assent was obtained from participants.  Data were unavailable for 4
participants due to technical errors and 23 were excluded for excessive
noise in the EEG data, leaving data for 412 participants.  The mean age
was 12. 64 years (SD = 0. 47 years), and the sample was 46. 8% female,
13. 1% Hispanic/Latino, 89. 1% Caucasian, 7. 8% African American,
2. 4% Asian American, 0. 2% Native American, and 0. 5% other race. 
2. 2.  Measures
2. 2. 1.  Social feedback task
Participants completed the Island Getaway task (modiﬁed from
Kujawa, Arfer Name, 2014) while EEG data were recorded.  The task
code is available at: http://arfer. net/projects/survivor.  Participants
were told that they would be playing a game with eleven age-matched
co-players in which they would be travelling in the Hawaiian Islands,
and at each island, they would have to vote whether they wanted each
co-player to continue on with them to the next island and would then
receive feedback on how co-players voted for them.  Trials were divided
into 6 rounds.  In the ﬁrst round, participants created a proﬁle including
their photograph and demographic information and reviewed proﬁles
of computerized co-players.  In subsequent rounds, participants ﬁrst
responded to a poll question (e. g. , “Who do you most admire?”) and
reviewed co-player responses in order to facilitate an exchange of
personal information for the remaining voting and feedback phases (see
Kujawa, Arfer Name, 2014 for a depiction of the poll phase). 
Following review of proﬁles and poll responses in each round,
participants completed a voting and feedback phase (Fig.  1).  Participants were prompted to vote to either accept (“Keep”) or reject (“Kick
out”) each co-player, and after each vote, they then saw feedback indicating whether that co-player had voted to accept or reject them. 
Acceptance feedback was indicated by an image of a green “thumbs up”
and rejection feedback was indicated by a red “thumbs down. ” Each
voting trial began with a co-player proﬁle presented until participants
voted.  To simulate variation in co-player response speed, a co-player
voting time was selected for each trial based on actual variability in
participants’ voting speeds from previously collected data.  If participants voted faster than the simulated voting time for that co-player, the
message “Waiting for [co-player’s name] to vote…” was displayed. 
Lastly, a ﬁxation “+” was presented for 1000 ms, followed by feedback
displayed for 2000 ms.  A blank screen was presented for 1500 ms before the start of the next trial. 
Co-players were randomly assigned a voting pattern for each participant, such that 2 co-players rejected the participant on most (4 or 5
out of 6) rounds, 2 co-players accepted the participant on most rounds,
and the remaining 7 co-players were equally likely to accept or reject

the participant.  To increase unpredictability of feedback, all co-players
voted both to keep and kick out the participant at least once (with the
exception of the co-player excluded after the ﬁrst round).  Variability in
co-player voting patterns allows for examining participant voting behavior in response to distinct patterns of peer feedback, but the task did
not include enough feedback trials to examine average ERP responses to
feedback from speciﬁc co-players. 
After each of the rounds, participants were told that one of the coplayers had been sent home, and after completing the sixth, participants
were informed that they made it to the “Big Island. ” The task included a
total of 51 feedback trials split evenly between acceptance and rejection, with the last trial type determined randomly, though the proportion of rejection and acceptance feedback in each round varied slightly
across participants.  The number of feedback trials in each round matched the number of co-players remaining in the game (e. g. , 11 in Round
1, 10 in Round 2). 
2. 2. 2.  EEG data collection and processing
Continuous EEG was recorded using a 34-electrode cap (32 channels
with the addition of FCz and Iz) and a BioSemi system (BioSemi,
Amsterdam, Netherlands).  The electrooculogram (EOG) generated from
eye movements and blinks was recorded using facial electrodes placed
approximately 1 cm above and below the eye and 1 cm from the outer
corners of the eyes.  Electrodes were also placed on the left and right
mastoids.  Recordings were digitized with a sampling rate of 1024 Hz. 
Oﬄine processing was conducted using BrainVision Analyzer software (Brain Products, Munich, Germany).  Data were referenced to an
average of the recordings from left and right mastoids, band-pass ﬁltered with cutoﬀs of 0. 1 and 30 Hz, and segmented for each trial
200 ms before feedback, continuing for 1000 ms after feedback onset. 
Eye-blink correction (Gratton, Coles, & Donchin, 1983) and semi-automatic artifact rejection procedures were conducted.  Criteria of a voltage
step of 50 μV between sample points, a maximum voltage diﬀerence of
300 μV within a 200 ms interval, and minimum activity of 0. 5 μV
within 100 ms intervals were used to automatically detect artifacts,
with additional artifacts removed by visual inspection.  ERPs were
averaged for acceptance and rejection feedback, and baseline corrected
to activity 200 ms prior to feedback. 
2. 2. 3.  Behavioral and self-report measures of social processing
During the task, participants were instructed to vote oﬀ a minimum
of 1 co-player per round, but were free to vote oﬀ as many co-players as
they chose.  Percentage of votes to reject peers was evaluated as a behavioral measure of social processing.  Similar to previous ERP research
using the Cyberball task (Kujawa, Arfer Name, 2014; McPartland Name,
2011), following completion of the task, participants responded to 3
self-report items rated on a 5-point scale to assess engagement in the
task (i. e. , “I really wanted to stay in the game,” “I would’ve liked to play
this game again,” and “After a while I lost interest in staying in the
game” [reverse scored]).  Scores on each item were averaged to derive a
combined measure of task engagement ranging from 1 to 5, with higher
scores indicating greater engagement.  Behavioral and self-report data
from Island Getaway were unavailable for 3 participants due to technical errors. 
2. 2. 4.  Internalizing symptoms
To measure current depressive symptoms, adolescents completed
the 27-item self-report version of the Children’s Depression Inventory
(CDI) (Kovacs, 1992).  Three participants chose not to respond to more
than 9 items on the CDI and were excluded from analyses of depressive
symptoms.  Cronbach’s alpha for the CDI in this sample was 0. 82.  To
measure anxiety, adolescents completed the 41-item self-report version
of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) (Birmaher
Name, 1997).  Consistent with our prior work (Kujawa, Arfer Name, 2014)
and theory that symptoms of social anxiety may be particularly relevant
to social feedback processing, analyses focused on the 7-item social
anxiety subscale.  Cronbach’s alpha for the social anxiety subscale was2. 3.  Data analysis
2. 3. 1.  PCA
Temporospatial PCA on averaged ERP data was conducted using the
ERP PCA Toolkit (Dien, 2010b).  First, temporal PCA was conducted
using all time points from each participant’s averaged data as variables,

and participants, trial types, and recording sites as observations.  A
Promax rotation was used to rotate to simple structure in the temporal
domain (Dien, 2010a; Dien, Khoe, & Mangun, 2007).  A parallel test
(Horn, 1965) was conducted on the resulting Scree plot (Cattell, 1966)
in which the Scree of the actual dataset was compared to a Scree derived from a fully random dataset.  The largest number of factors accounting for a greater proportion of variance than the random dataset
were retained (Dien, 2010a).  Based on this criterion, 10 temporal factors (TF) were retained.  Following the temporal PCA, a spatial PCA was
conducted on each temporal factor (Dien, 2010a; Dien Name, 2007). 
Variables consisted of all recording sites, and observations included
participants, trial types, and temporal factor scores.  Infomax was used
to rotate the spatial factors to independence (Dien, 2010a).  Based on
the results of the parallel test, 4 spatial factors (SF) were extracted.  The
temporospatial PCA resulted in 40 factor combinations, with combined
unique variance accounting for 32. 5% of variance in the ERP data.  To
aid in interpretation, factor score were translated into voltages using
the ERP PCA Toolkit (Dien, 2012), and robust analysis of variance
(ANOVA; Keselman, Wilcox, & Lix, 2003) was conducted on factors
accounting for greater than 1% of unique variance in order to identify
components that signiﬁcantly diﬀerentiated acceptance and rejection
feedback. 
2. 3. 2.  Correlations between measures and with symptoms
Subsequent analyses on microvolt-scaled factor scores exported by
ERP PCA Toolkit were conducted using SPSS 23.  Bivariate correlations
were computed to examine associations between ERP, self-report, behavioral measures, and symptoms of depression and social anxiety. 
3.  Results
3. 1.  PCA
Average ERPs to acceptance and rejection feedback at Cz prior to
PCA are presented in Fig.  2.  PCA revealed 7 temporospatial factors
accounting for a minimum of 1% unique variance in the ERP.  Of these,
5 components signiﬁcantly diﬀerentiated acceptance from rejection
feedback in robust ANOVA (Table 1; Fig.  3).  These components included an early negativity, followed by a series of relative positivities
for acceptance feedback.  The early negativity component (TF4/SF1)
appeared similar to an N1 component, possibly reﬂecting attentional
processing (Coch & Gullick, 2012), and was enhanced (i. e. , more negative) for rejection compared to acceptance feedback.  TF2/SF1,
maximal at Cz, appeared the most consistent with the RewP in terms of
timing and scalp distribution, though the distribution was somewhat
more posterior than observed in monetary reward tasks (Foti Name,
2011).  The remaining 3 positive components were similar to P300 and
late positive potential (LPP), and were consistent with observations in
adults of a series of P300/LPP responses to emotional images and
monetary rewards beginning around 300 ms after stimulus onset andemerging across stimulus duration (Foti, Hajcak, & Dien, 2009; Foti
Name, 2011).  All of the positivities in the current PCA were enhanced
for acceptance relative to rejection feedback. 
Consistent with our previous work on social feedback processing
(Kujawa, Arfer Name, 2014) and to reduce the number of analyses
performed, further analyses of correlations between measures focused
on the microvolt-scaled factor score corresponding with the RewP
component (TF2/SF1).  Given recent recommendations (Meyer, Lerner,
de los Reyes, Laird, & Hajcak, 2017), residual scores were computed for
the RewP factor score to acceptance adjusting for responses to rejection,
producing a diﬀerence measure that is uncorrelated with RewP to rejection feedback.
