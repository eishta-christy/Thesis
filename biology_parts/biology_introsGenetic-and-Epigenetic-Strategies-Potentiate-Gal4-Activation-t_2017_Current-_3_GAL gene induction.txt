In Brief
Sood and Brickner ﬁnd that faster GAL
gene induction during transcriptional
memory accelerates adaptation to
galactose and requires both previously
produced Gal1 to relieve Gal80
repression and the Gal4 central domain,
which potentiates stronger activation. 
Related yeasts use either genetic or
epigenetic means to alter GAL gene
activation rates.
