The Plastid Genome in Cladophorales Green Algae Is
Encoded by Hairpin ChromosomesHighlights
d The chloroplast genome of Cladophorales algae is
fragmented into hairpin chromosomes
d The hairpin chromosomes are short GC-rich ssDNA
molecules with one or two genes
d Chloroplast genes are highly divergent from their
corresponding orthologs
d Fragmentation of the chloroplast genome coincided with
gene transfer to the nucleusAndrea Del Cortona, Frederik Leliaert,

In Brief
Del Cortona Name describe intriguing
features of the plastid genome of
Cladophorales, which is fragmented into
linear ssDNA molecules that fold into
hairpin conﬁgurations due to the
presence of inverted repeats.  This
architecture is unprecedented among
eukaryotes, and highlights unexpected
variation in plastid genome structure.

https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 004Virtually all plastid (chloroplast) genomes are circular double-stranded DNA molecules, typically between 100 and 200 kb in size and encoding circa
80–250 genes.  Exceptions to this universal plastid
genome architecture are very few and include the
dinoﬂagellates, where genes are located on DNA
minicircles.  Here we report on the highly deviant
chloroplast genome of Cladophorales green algae,
which is entirely fragmented into hairpin chromosomes.  Short- and long-read high-throughput
sequencing of DNA and RNA demonstrated that
the chloroplast genes of Boodlea composita are
encoded on 1- to 7-kb DNA contigs with an exceptionally high GC content, each containing a long inverted repeat with one or two protein-coding genes
and conserved non-coding regions putatively
involved in replication and/or expression.
