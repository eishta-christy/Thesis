Public health messages delivered in video format are the mainstay
of smoking-cessation campaigns that have contributed to the decline in
smoking prevalence in the US (Woloshin, Schwartz, & Welch, 2008). 
Yet, despite these eﬀorts, smoking remains a leading cause of mortality
and morbidity worldwide, and is responsible for more than 480,000
deaths annually in the United States alone (U. S.  Department of Health
and Human Services, 2014).  Therefore, it is imperative to identify the
factors that inﬂuence audiences’ cognitive processing of smoking-cessation videos (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). 
Sensory features, which attract viewer’s attention through engaging visuals, edits, and music, have been hypothesized to be one such factor
(D’Silva and Palmgreen, 2007; Helme, Donohew, Baier, & Zittleman, 2007;
Morgan, Palmgreen, Stephenson, Hoyle, & Lorch, 2003).  Message sensation
value (MSV) is a validated measure that has been developed to quantify
such sensory features in health promotion videos (Morgan Name, 2003).  The
prevailing assumption that higher MSV improves cognitive processing and
eﬀectiveness of health promotion videos has been challenged by recent
neuroimaging studies, which found that videos with lower MSV were better
remembered and elicited greater prefrontal and temporal
response
(Langleben Name, 2009; Seelig Name, 2014).  These ﬁndings are consistent
with predictions of the limited cognitive capacity theories.  These theories
suggest that although high MSV attracts viewers’ attention, it also diverts
cognitive resources from processing the health information content in the
videos (Petty and Cacioppo, 1986; Wilson and Wolf, 2009). 
While these studies question the value of utilizing high MSV as an
eﬀective communication tool, they do not address the possibility that
individual diﬀerences in attention to sensory stimulation may be responsible for the lack of eﬀectiveness of high-MSV videos at a population level (Everett and Palmgreen, 1995; Stephenson and Palmgreen,
2001).  Such diﬀerences would have been of purely academic interest in
the era of network television, but as media becomes more personalized,
individual diﬀerences in the neurocognitive processing of health promotion videos begin to acquire real life relevance (Chua Name, 2011). 
Yet, experimental data on the biological basis of individual diﬀerences
in the cognitive processing of health messages are very limited.  Many
key traits that may aﬀect individual ability to process health messages,
such as selective attention, working memory and reward sensitivity, are
inﬂuenced by dopaminergic neurotransmission (Gordon, Devaney,
Bean, & , Vaidya, 2015).  The dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) has a
variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism that modulates
dopaminergic neurotransmission, with the 10-repeat (10R) and 9-repeat (9R) alleles as the most common forms (Mitchell Name, 2000).  The

10R/10R homozygosity has been linked to a higher level of novelty
seeking, a trait that indicates greater reactivity to novel external stimulation (Sabol Name, 1999).  The 10R allele has also been consistently
implicated in increased susceptibility to attention deﬁcit disorder
(ADD) (Cook Name, 1995; Gill, Daly, Heron, Hawi, & Fitzgerald, 1997;
Gizer, Ficks, & Waldman, 2009; Kebir, Tabbane, Sengupta, & Joober,
2009; Newman Name, 2014).  Although it remains unclear whether this
association is mediated by the dopamine or dopamine transporter levels
(Yang Name, 2007), it suggests that homozygous 10R allele carriers are
more likely than others to exhibit poor attentional processing, e. g. 
diﬃculty ﬁltering out irrelevant sensory stimuli, which is a key
symptom of ADD (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).  Therefore,
it is possible that when exposed to public health video messages with
high MSV, 10R DAT1 homozygotes would be more engaged by the attention-grabbing sensory features compared to carriers of other genotypes. 
The present study sought to examine the eﬀect of DAT1 polymorphism on the brain response to high MSV format.  The value of such
candidate gene approach is limited by the a priori assumptions about
the relationship between the gene and the phenotype (Tabor,
Risch, & Myers, 2002).  However, it remains useful as the practical approach to generate initial data on the eﬀects of individual genetic
makeup on the neurocognitive processing of public health communication in a small sample (Simon Name, 2011).  Such studies would help
to demonstrate the relevance of genetics to the processing of public
health video ads and to determine the feasibility of the larger and much
more expensive genome-wide association studies.  Building on the link
between the 10R DAT1 allele and attentional processing deﬁcits described above, we hypothesized that smokers with two copies of the
10R allele (10/10) would diﬀer from smokers without the 10R homozygosity (non-10/10) in the neural response to high-MSV smokingcessation videos.  Speciﬁcally, we hypothesized that the 10/10 smokers
would show greater neural response to high-MSV vs.  low-MSV videos
than the non-10/10 smokers in two brain regions: the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
(rVLPFC).  These regions form the strongly right lateralized “ventral
attention network” that underlies bottom-up, stimulus-driven attentional processing (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Fox, Corbetta, Snyder,
Vincent, & Raichle, 2006; Petersen and Posner, 2012; Vossel,
Geng, & Fink, 2014), and are thus likely to be modulated by the greater
attention-grabbing sensory content in high-MSV videos.  The secondary
aim of the present study was to explore the contribution of the diﬀerences between 10/10 and non-10/10 smokers’ ventral attention network response during one-time exposure to smoking-cessation videos to
individual variation in future smoking behavior.  Smoking was indexedSchoﬁeld-Hurwitz, Hardt,
Levasseur, & Tremblay,Brody, & Benowitz, 1990) and objective (urine levels of the nicotine
metabolite cotinine) measures of smoking (Pokorski, Chen, & Bertholf,
1994; Wall, Johnson, Jacob, & Benowitz, 1988), immediately before
and approximately one month after the one-time exposure to 16
smoking-cessation videos.

2. 1.  Participants
Seventy-four non-treatment-seeking adult daily smokers participated in the study.  Eight participants were excluded due to excessive
(>1 voxel) head motion during the MRI scan and 15 participants declined to be genotyped, leaving 53 participants (23 female; 3 lefthanded) who passed MRI quality control and were genotyped. 
Participants reported their racial-ethnic characteristics as follows: 28
White, 19 African American, 4 Asian, and 2 Hispanic.  Their ages ranged(M ± SE = 31. 34 ± 1. 33), with
14. 16 ± 0. 26 years of education.  All participants gave writtenand49
informed consent to participate in the protocol approved by the
University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.  Exclusion criteria were (1) presence of any DSM-IV-TR Axis 1 psychiatric disorder
except tobacco use disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2000);
(2) urine drug screen positive for illicit opioids, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, or methamphetamine; (3) baseline urinary cotinine
levels <50 ng/ml (SRNT Subcommittee on Biochemical Veriﬁcation,
2002); (4) presence of medical or neurological disorder or treatment
that may aﬀect the cerebrovascular system; and (5) safety-related
contraindications for MRI scanning. 
2. 2.  Task
The video-viewing task is described in the Supplementary materials
and in Wang Name (2013).  Each participant viewed eight smokingcessation videos with Low MSV and eight with High MSV in a random
order, separated by a 16 s rest period (gray cross-hair on a homogenous
black background).  A 16 s rest period was also presented at the beginning of the task.  Each video was 30 s long and presented only once. 
2. 3.  Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from anti-coagulated venous blood
samples using a standard salting out method (Lahiri and Nurnberger,
1991).  Genotyping of
the DAT1 40 bp repeat polymorphism
(rs28363170) was performed as previously described (Franklin Name,
2009; Vandenbergh Name, 1992) (see Supplementary material).  Participants were divided into two cohorts by the DAT1 genotype: 26
homozygous (two copies) for the 10-repeat allele, and 27 with one or no
10R alleles (21 with 10R/9R, 2 with 9R/8R, and 1 each with 10R/8R,
9R/9R, and 3R/3R). 
2. 4.  Procedure
The study included a phone screening, baseline assessment, fMRI
session, and a follow-up session 1 month later.  Participants were asked
to avoid nicotine-replacement products throughout the study and to
report any use of such products.  At the baseline session, participants
were evaluated for eligibility, demographics, and handedness (Oldﬁeld,
1971).  One hour before the fMRI session, participants provided urine
samples for baseline cotinine levels, reported the average number of
cigarettes smoked per day in the past 30 days, and completed the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) (Heatherton, Kozlowski,
Frecker, & Fagerstrom, 1991) and other behavioral assessments (see
Supplementary material).  Approximately 30–45 min before the fMRI
session, participants were given an opportunity to smoke one of their
own cigarettes outdoors under observation.  This minimized individual
diﬀerences in craving for cigarettes during fMRI session, and avoided
this potential confound to the brain response to smoking-cessation videos.  All participants took the opportunity to smoke.  Before the video
task began, participants were instructed to attend to the videos.  At the
follow-up± SE = 32. 08 ± 2. 10 d), urine samples for cotinine level were again
obtained.  Participants were debriefed about the cotinine assay and the
study hypotheses only after completion of all assessments.

MRI imaging was performed using Siemens Tim Trio 3T (Erlangen)
system and a 32-channel receive-only head coil.  Blood oxygenation
level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI was performed, using a whole-brain,
single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar sequence with the following
parameters:
matrix = 64 × 64, slice thickness/gap = 3. 4/0 mm, 32 slices, eﬀective
voxel resolution of 3. 4 × 3. 4 × 3. 4 mm.  After BOLD fMRI, 5-min
MPRAGE T1-weighted images were acquired with the following

parameters:
matrix = 256 × 192, eﬀective voxel resolution of 1 × 1 × 1 mm.  An
oblique acquisition, oriented along the anterior commissure–posterior
commissure line, allowed coverage of the entire brain with the exception of the lower cerebellum. 
FOV = 250 mm,
2. 6.  Functional imaging data analysis
Functional imaging data were analyzed using SPM 8 (Wellcome
Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK).  Images were adjusted for
slice timing, realigned to the ﬁrst scan to correct for head motion,
normalized into stereotactic Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
space with 3-mm cubic voxels, and spatially smoothed by a Gaussian
ﬁlter with full-width/half-maximum parameter (FWHM) set to 8 mm. 
Voxelwise individual-level statistical analyses were performed by
modeling High-MSV and Low-MSV videos using a canonical hemodynamic response function.  Six rigid body motion parameters were included as covariates, and the rest periods were treated as the baseline. 
The eﬀects of MSV were tested by contrasting High-MSV videos with
Low-MSV videos.  To test the diﬀerence in MSV eﬀect between 10/10
and non-10/10 participants, contrast images were subjected to independent-sample t-tests to examine the eﬀect of DAT1 genotype (10/
10 vs.  non-10/10).  The MSV eﬀect across all participants was examined
by one-sample t-test and is reported in the Supplementary material as a
replication of a previous study (Wang Name, 2013). 
Two key regions of the ventral attention network, the right temporoparietal
junction (rTPJ) and the right ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex (rVLPFC), were tested as a priori regions of interest (ROIs).  Based
on a previous meta-analysis (Fox Name, 2006), the rTPJ and rVLPFC
ROIs were deﬁned as 6-radius spheres centered at x/y/z = 59/–47/22
and x/y/z = 41/21/–6 (MNI coordinates converted from Talairach
space (Lancaster Name, 2007).  We also conducted a preliminary wholebrain search for the 10/10 vs non-10/10 group diﬀerences in other
brain regions.  We used a common procedure that included a 2000iteration Monte-Carlo simulation that determined the combined “voxellevel p < 0. 005” and “cluster size > 52” thresholds required for a
whole-brain corrected p < 0. 05.  Similar threshold has been shown to
produce a balance in Type I and Type II errors (Lieberman and
Cunningham, 2009).  Contrast values of parameter estimates were extracted from signiﬁcant clusters using MarsBaR 0. 42 (http://marsbar. 
sourceforge. net) for post hoc correlation and mediation analyses. 
2. 7.  Predictability analysis
We used the leave-one-out cross-validation analysis to test whether
brain response could predict future smoking behavior measured by
cotinine levels at the follow-up session (Hastie, Tibshirani, & Friedman,
2009).  We performed a regression analysis on all except one participant, with follow-up cotinine levels (adjusted for baseline levels) as the
dependent variable, and the brain response as the independent variable. 
The parameter estimates obtained from the regression model were thenSummary of behavioral measures (M ± SE). 
applied to the omitted participant, yielding a predicted value of his/her
follow-up cotinine level.  After repeating this procedure over every
participant, the inaccuracy of prediction was estimated by the mean
squared error (MSE), that is, MSE = [Σi(Ŷ−i − Yi)2]/N, where N is the
number of participants, Yi is the actual follow-up cotinine level for the ith participant, and Ŷ−i is the predicted follow-up cotinine level for the
i-th participant based on the regression model with all but the i-th
participant.  The signiﬁcance of MSE was determined by a permutation
test.  For each of the 10,000 permutations, a random MSE (i. e.  MSEnull)
was calculated after permuting the correspondence between follow-up
cotinine levels and brain response.  This yielded an empirical distribution of prediction inaccuracy under the null hypothesis that there was
no association between brain response and follow-up cotinine levels. 
The signiﬁcance of the original MSE was then calculated as Prob
(MSE ≥ MSEnull). 
2. 8.  Mediation analysis
To determine whether brain response to MSV in the ventral attention network mediated eﬀects of DAT1 genotype on cotinine levels at
the follow-up session, we conducted mediation analysis using the
PROCESS macro for SPSS 22 (Model 4; http://www. processmacro. org). 
The signiﬁcance of the indirect eﬀect was determined by a 5000iteration bootstrapping procedure (Preacher and Hayes, 2004, 2008). 
Although the direct and total eﬀects have had less weight in recent
literature, we examined them as well, to better connect with the earlier
literature (Rucker, Preacher, Tormala, & Petty, 2011; Shrout and
Bolger, 2002; Zhao, Lynch, & Chen, 2010).  Listwise deletion was used to
manage missing values.  This procedure removed ﬁve 10/10 participants and eight non-10/10 participants leaving a total of 40 participants in the model.  We also used multiple imputations as an alternative
way to manage missing values (Allison, 2001).

3. 2.  fMRI resultsLow-MSV smoking-cessation
Analysis of the a priori ROIs showed that, compared to the non-10/
10 participants, the 10/10 participants showed greater rTPJ response to
the High-MSV vs. ± SE = 0. 20 ± 0. 06 vs.  0. 00 ± 0. 05; t(51) = 2. 42, p < 0. 02).  A trend
in the same direction was found for the rVLPFC (−0. 02 ± 0. 05 vs. 
−0. 19 ± 0. 07; t(51) = 1. 92, p = 0. 06).  Whole-brain analysis showed
that, compared to the non-10/10 participants, the 10/10 participants
showed greater neural response to High-MSV vs.  Low-MSV videos at the
left TPJ (lTPJ), rTPJ, rVLPFC, and right middle temporal gyrus (rMTG)
(see Fig.  1 and Table 2).  No regions showed greater MSV eﬀect in the
non-10/10 compared to 10/10 participants.  These ﬁndings remained
signiﬁcant after controlling for race and gender (see Supplementary
results). 
(r = 0. 37, p < 0. 02) (see Fig.  2A).  Leave-one-out cross-validation
conﬁrmed the predictive power of the rTPJ neural response, which
produced signiﬁcantly smaller MSE compared to that obtained from
randomization (p < 0. 02) (see Fig.  2B).  The rVLPFC response was not
correlated with cotinine levels (r = 0. 18, p = 0. 26).  Similarly, there
was no correlation between the rTPJ response and self-reported cigarettes per day (r = 0. 21, p = 0. 18). 
Next, we tested the mediation model using DAT1 genotype as the
independent variable (1 = 10/10, −1 = non-10/10), follow-up cotinine levels as the dependent variable, rTPJ response to High-MSV vs. 
Low-MSV videos as the mediator, and baseline cotinine levels as a
covariate.  There was a signiﬁcant indirect eﬀect of DAT1 genotype on
follow-up cotinine levels through the rTPJ neural response (indirect
eﬀect = 146.
