According to the current thinking, schizophrenia is the result of a
functional dysconnection between various integrative cerebral regions
[1,2] which, for a number of cases at least, has a neurodevelopmental
origin [3,4].  One of these regions, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), appears
to be especially aﬀected [5], as suggested by cytoarchitectural, morphological and functional anomalies described in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in the left hemisphere [6–8].  These anomalies
could be due to perinatal changes occurring during cerebral development, in particular in cellular migration, with changes expressed in the
form of defective connectivity which leads to the characteristic psychic
dissociation observed in schizophrenia. 
Concerning the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the existence of a
transmission is
striatal dopaminergic (DAergic)
dysregulation of
generally acknowledged [9] and is supported by a number of studies of
brain imaging performed over the past 20 years which highlighted an
enhanced basal level of striatal dopamine (DA) as well as an increase in
its release in non-treated patients with schizophrenia compared to
healthy subjects [10].  These data that suggest an increase in DAergic
transmission are in keeping with the common property of typical and
atypical antipsychotics, which is to block type D2 DAergic receptors. 
However, the increase in basal DA transmission may not be uniformly
distributed in the striatum, and some authors have suggested diﬀerences between sub-regions of the striatum, namely an increase in the
anterior dorsal striatum, but not in the ventral striatum [11,12].  The
striatum is the principal region of projection of mesencephalic DAergic
neurons and comprises two regions, the dorsal striatum and the ventral
striatum.  The main component of the ventral striatum is the nucleus
accumbens (Nacc), usually subdivided into two subsections which can

be diﬀerentiated from an anatomo-functional point of view.  These two
subsections are an external part, the shell sub-region, which surrounds a
central part, the core sub-region, located near the anterior commissureIn neuroimaging studies [11,12], no subdivision was made between
the core and shell sub-regions of the ventral striatum.  As regards differentiation between the core and shell parts of the Nacc in humans,
post-mortem anatomical studies suggest that the DA synthesis, as assessed in terms of the density of tyrosine hydroxylase labelling, is similar for the two sub-regions of the Nacc in control subjects and patients with schizophrenia [14].  However, in contrast to that, recent
human post-mortem ultrastructural
investigations revealed an enhancement in the density of asymmetric synapses, typical of excitatory
aﬀerents, in the core part of the Nacc but not in the shell of patients with
schizophrenia, compared to controls [15].  A reduction in the postsynaptic density (PSD) area of asymmetric synapses was also observed
in both core and shell parts of the Nacc, but more markedly so in the core
sub-region of patients [15].  Whatever the exact meaning of the ultrastructural data, they may suggest that control of DA release by excitatory inputs may be aﬀected diﬀerently in the two parts of the Nacc
in patients with schizophrenia (and preferentially in the core part). 
As regards the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, a dysfunction of
glutamatergic transmission involving N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors has also been suggested [16].  Based on the results of several
studies carried out in humans it has been established that at sub-anesthetic doses, administration of non-competitive antagonists of NMDA
receptors induced symptoms comparable to those observed in schizophrenia in healthy subjects [17,18] and aggravated such symptoms in
patients with schizophrenia [19,20].  These observations led several
authors [16,21] to propose that the dysregulation of the striatal
DAergic transmission in schizophrenia could result from defective
prefrontal-striatal connectivity involving NMDA receptors. 
Improving our knowledge of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia
is vital for the development of new treatments.  The nature of the disease is such, however, that it is not easy to conduct clinical investigations with non-treated patients, which is why animal modeling of the
pathophysiology of schizophrenia is so important [22].  The aforementioned data suggest several hypotheses should be taken into account
with a view to achieving the best possible animal modeling of the
disease.  In particular, it is important to bear in mind that rather than
being evenly dysregulated, striatal DAergic transmission in schizophrenia may be dysregulated diﬀerently in the striatal sub-regions.  In
this context, and also taking into account the hypothesis of a neurodevelopmental impairment of the left PFC as well as that of defective
prefrontal-striatal connectivity involving NMDA receptors in schizophrenia, we previously investigated DAergic responses to challenge
with NMDA antagonists in the anterior dorsal striatum [23] and in the
dorsomedial shell part of the Nacc [24] in adult rats microinjected with
tetrodotoxin (TTX) at postnatal day 8 (PND8).  The results showed that
in adult animals neonatally inactivated with TTX, compared to respective PBS control animals, treatment with the NMDA antagonist
ketamine induced a greater increase in DA release in the anterior dorsal
striatum [23].  As regards the dorsomedian shell, at adulthood the
NMDA antagonists ketamine and MK 801 induced a decrease in DA
release below basal levels in PBS controls, whereas administration of
the two NMDA antagonists induced a reversal of the DA reduction
observed in PBS controls followed by an increase in DA levels in animals neonatally microinjected with TTX in the PFC [24].
