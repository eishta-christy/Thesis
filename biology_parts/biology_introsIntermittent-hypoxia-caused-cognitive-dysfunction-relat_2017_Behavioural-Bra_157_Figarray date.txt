Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a common prevalent disorder which is
associated with increased cardiovascular morbidities and mortality,
metabolic dysfunction and neurocognitive impairments [1].  With the
progress of OSA, patients will suﬀer from daytime sleepiness, depression, decline in memory, emotional disorders, cognitive loss, decline in
the ability of language understanding and expressing [2].  Intermittent
hypoxia (IH), as one of the major pathophysiological changes of OSA,
plays a signiﬁcant role in the processing of OSA [3].  Exposure to IH is
associated with neurodegenerative changes in addition to alterations in
brain regions and neurotransmitter systems involved in learning and
memory, attention, and locomotor activity.  Multiple pathophysiological
processes appear to be involved in the mechanistic aspects of the behavioral and neuronal susceptibility to IH, and include pathways
leading to increased oxidative stress and inﬂammation, altered gene
regulation, and decreases in the cellular and molecular substrates of
synaptic plasticity [4].  In addition, both environmental and genetic
factors modulate the end-organ susceptibility to IH-induced cognitive
dysfunction.  Collectively, the available data indicated that the cognitive
impairment could be the consequence of IH in the brain [5]. 
MicroRNA (miRNA) which is the endogenous non-coding singlestranded small molecule RNA has the capacity for blocking a number of
target genes and suppressing their translation [6].  Research on stroke
and brain injury found that regulating miRNA expression in brain could
alleviate the neuronal apoptosis and improve neurobehavioral functions [7–9].  Thus intervening the target genes through up/down-regulating the expression of target miRNA could be a potential way to
protect from cognitive impairment after IH.  It is important to analyse
the miRNA expression in rat hippocampus after chronic intermittent
hypoxia.  As far as we know, miRNA expression in rat hippocampus after
IH has not been reported yet.  In our study, we investigate the microarray based analysis of microRNA expression proﬁling in rat hippocampus after IH which could lay some foundation for future study of the
miRNA functional mechanism involved in the complex course of OSAreduced cognitive impairment.

2. 1.  Animal model of intermittent hypoxia
Animal care and experiments were conducted in accordance with
the Policy of Animal Care and Use Committee of Tianjin Medical
University.  Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 280–300 g, 3 month-old)
were purchased from the Department Of Laboratory Animal Science
(Peking University Health Science Center).  The animals were housed on
a 12-h light/dark cycle in a temperature controlled animal facility with
food and water available ad libitum.  Animals were divided into four
groups (n = 12/group) for microarray, RT-PCR and western blot, including control (normoxia) group, IH 1 week group, IH 2 weeks group
and IH 4 weeks group.  Furthermore, we added 32 rats to detect spatial
learning and memory by MWM after IH 2 weeks and 4 weeks.  Rats
underwent intermittent hypoxia (IH) at a rate of 30 cycles/h (nadir 5%
O2 to peak 21% O2 with 0% CO2), or room air breathing (control) in
the same plastic cage placed next to the cage equipped with the IH
apparatus for 8 h/d during the “light on” period of 12 h.  In each cycle,
for the ﬁrst 30 s, the oxygen concentration inside was lowered to 5%
and maintained for 50 s, followed by an increase in the oxygen concentration to 21% for 40 s [10].  The IH rats were allowed free access to
food and water, while the amount of food for control rats was restricted
to adjust their average body weight comparable to that of the IH rats
every week.

caspase-3 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), GAPDH (1:1000, Cell
Signaling Technology), Bcl-2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) and
Bax (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), all dissolved in TBST. 
Subsequently, blots were washed 3 times by TBST and incubated with
second antibody HRP goa tanti-rabbit
(1:1000, Cell Signaling
Technology) for 1 h at room temperature.  Protein bands were detected
with Immolilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore,
USA).  Chemiluminesence was imaged in a Molecular Imager Chemi
Doc™ XRS + WB with Image Lab™ software (Bio-Rad, CA, USA), and
band intensity was measured by Image J software. 
2. 5.  MiRNA microarray analysis
We used Onearray (by Phalanx Biotech Group, china) to analysis the
miRNAs regulated after IH.  MiRNAs were enriched from total RNA
extracted using a mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit and labeled with a
mirVana Array Labeling Kit (Ambion).  The labeled miRNAs were used
for hybridization on each miRNA microarray, to determine the diﬀerential expression of miRNAs.  This procedure was repeated twice.  Target
labeling, hybridization, imaging and data processing were performed at
Phalan Biotech according to the protocols described by the manufacturers using the Mouse & Rat miRNA OneArray Microarray and
Sanger miRBase 19.  Data were acquired using Agilent Feature
Extraction software version 10. 7.  Further data analyses were performed
using GeneSpring GX 10. 0. 
2. 2.  Morris Water Maze test
2. 6.  RNA isolution and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
The Morris Water Maze test was used to assess spatial reference
learning and memory in the animals.  An escape platform (10 cm in
diameter) was positioned 1 cm below the water surface.  Distinctive,
geometric, extramaze cues were aﬃxed at speciﬁc locations and were
visible to the animals while in the maze.  The spatial acquisition trial
was performed on 15–19 d and 29–33 d post-IH, and the reference
memory probe trail was conducted 24 h after the last spatial acquisition
training as previously reported [11].  Each spatial acquisition trial session consisted of four trials separated by a 15 min inter-trial interval.  In
each training trial, the rat was placed in the maze from a quasi-random
start point and allowed a maximum of 90 s to ﬁnd the escape platform,
where it remained for 15 s.  Rats that failed to locate the platform at the
end of 90 s were manually guided to the platform.  On the day following
acquisition testing, memory retention was evaluated in a single 60sprobe trial in which the submerged platform was removed and the
animal released from the quadrant opposite the former platform-containing quadrant.  The entire procedure in the pool was monitored by a
tracking system (Ethovision 3. 0, Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands) to record the latency-time to reach the platform
and calculate the time spent in the goal quadrant and the average
swimming speed. 
2. 3.  Tissue preparation
Rats were sacriﬁced by transcardiac perfusion with cold PBS to
eliminate the RNA and protein expressed by blood cells.  Brieﬂy, the
brain was dissected and the hippocampus was removed.  The tissues
were then ﬂash-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA
examination and protein extraction [12]. 
2. 4.  Western blot
The protein concentrations were detected with Pierce BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Thermo, USA).  According to the manufacture's protocol,
equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto PVDF membrance (Millipore, Bedford, MA).  Then blots
were blocked by 5% nonfat milk dissolved in TBST for 2 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the following primary antibodies: cleavage
The RNA was harvested from acquired tissues using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.  cDNA generation and RT-PCR was performed using Hairpin-itTM
miRNA/mRNA RT-PCR Quantitation kit
(GenePharma, Shanghai,
China).  All PCR reactions were performed using standard PCR conditions.  U6 served as the internal control for miR-26b and miR-207, and
the primer sequences showed in Table 1.  The cycle threshold (Ct value)
was acquired using the Opticon Monitor Analysis Software (MJ Research, St.  Bruno, Quebec, Canada).  The data were analyzed using the
2−△△Ct method, in which the RNA levels of the normoxia group were
used as controls. 
2. 7.  Statistical analysis
The data are expressed as mean ± SD.  Statistical analysis was
performed with SPSS19. 0 and GraphPad Prism 5.  Data from the spatial
acquisition trial of the MWM test were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA.  For other data, statistical comparisons were analyzed
using a one-way ANOVA followed by a LSD post hoc analysis.  When p
values were less than 0. 05, statistical signiﬁcance was considered.

learning performance in these rats using Morris water maze tasks.  As
shown in Fig.  1, the results of the escape latency of the tested animals to
IH signiﬁcantly increased the escape latency on the last four training
days (days 16–19 and 30–33) in comparison to the control group
(*p < 0. 05, **p < 0. 01).  This ﬁnding indicates that exposure to IH
negatively aﬀects task performance in comparison to the control animals post-IH 2 and 4 weeks.  For the swimming speed, our results revealed that there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence among the IH and control group.  These results indicate that there was no eﬀect of IH at the
tested doses on the motor activity of the animals.  The percentage of
time spent in the target quadrant diﬀered signiﬁcantly between the IH
group and control group (p = 0. 0331 for 2 W, p = 0. 0231 for 4 W). 
3. 2.  Western blot for the expression of markers for apoptosis
Since the IH induced memory and learning dysfunction was mostly
hippocampus-dependent, we investigated the apoptosis and anti-apoptosis proteins in the rat hippocampus after IH.  The expression levels of
Bcl-2, Bax and Cleaved Caspase-3 in hippocampus after IH injury were
detected by the western blot assay.  Our results showed that the expression level of Bax (P < 0. 0001) and Cleaved Caspase-3 (P = 0. 005)
were increased, while the expression level of Bcl2 (P < 0. 0001) was
decreased after IH injury (Figs.  2–3).  These data suggest that IH increases the apoptosis in the rat hippocampus. 
3. 3.  Total RNA quality
The purity of RNA was detected by ultraviolet spectrophotometer in
the ration of the readings at 260 nm and 280 nm (A260/A280).  A ratio
of absorbances at 260 nm and 280 nm (A260/A280) more than 1. 8 is
usually considered an acceptable indicator of RNA purity which indicates that there is no detectable protein contamination of the RNA
sample.  A ratio of absorbances at 260 nm and 230 nm (A260/A230)
greater than 1. 5 indicates that there is no detectable other organics in
the RNA sample.  The assessment of RNA Integrity Number (RIN) which
the ratio of 18 s to 28 s rRNA not less than 5 indicates the sample can be
used to detect.  The results showed that the A260/A280 ratio was in the
range of 1. 8–2. 0, the A260/A230 ration was in the range of 2. 3–2. 4,
and the RIN ration was in the range of 7. 7–8. 6, which indicated that the
purity and integrity of RNA extracted from rat brain hippocampus
tissue met the requirements for the following microarray experiments. 
3. 4.  Diﬀerences in the distribution of gene probe and microarray analysis
Volcano plot revealed the diﬀerences in the distribution of gene
probe in diﬀerent groups (Fig.  4).  As we used a single channel to scan
the array, the data we got from each group should be compared with
the data of sham group to discover the diﬀerent expression of miRNAs. 
Each point represents a gene probe, plots by log2 |Fold change| on the
horizontal axis represents fold change and the negative log10(P-value)
on the vertical axis represents signiﬁcance of diﬀerence.  The red and
green dotted line respectively represents P-value and fold-change
threshold screening.  We set the threshold screening of diﬀerential genes
log2 |Fold change| ≥ 0. 585 and p-value < 0. 05.  Our result revealed
that 15 miRNAs were up-regulated and 46 miRNAs were down-regulated after IH 1 week, 5 miRNAs were up-regulated and 14 miRNAs
were down-regulated after IH 2 weeks, and 10 miRNAs were up-regulated with 14 miRNAs were down-regulated after IH 4 weeks (Fig.  5). 
From the array date, we found that the expression of miR-26b-5p and
miR-148b-3p were up-regulated at all the three time points (1w, 2w,
4w) post IH.  The ratio of global up-regulation miR-26b and miR-148b3p against sham group were 1.
