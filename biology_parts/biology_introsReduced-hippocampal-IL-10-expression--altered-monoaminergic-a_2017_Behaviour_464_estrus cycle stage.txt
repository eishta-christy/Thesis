The incidence of stress-related disorders, such as depression, is approximately twice as high in women as in men [1,2].  In addition, the
symptoms and pharmacological treatments of these conditions diﬀer in
both sexes [3].  This disparity could be due to physiological and behavioral sexual diﬀerences in response to the same stressor or diﬀerences
in the stimuli perceived as stressful [4–6].  Despite these ﬁndings, the
contribution of these diﬀerences to the development of stress-related
disorders in women is poorly understood.  This lack of knowledge may
be due to bias toward males in research in this ﬁeld, perhaps because of
the need for a homogeneous sample devoid of hormonal ﬂuctuations
[7] or the lack of a social stress model appropriate for females. 
Chronic social stress is considered the most common etiological
factor in the precipitation of depressive disorders in humans [8].  In
preclinical studies, a commonly used animal model of social stress is

social defeat in male rodents.  This model is based on the resident-intruder paradigm, where subjects interact aggressively to establish
dominance over the territory [9].  This model has been very useful in
establishing the mechanisms underlying depressive symptoms [10,11]
but is not considered adequate to induce chronic social stress in females
because females do not exhibit territorial aggression [12,13].  Given the
importance of social support in coping with stress in females [6], the
disruption of the social network may be a more valid social stressor. 
Thus, the chronic social instability stress model used in rats [12] and
mice [14] seems to be a better suited stress model given the social
nature of females.  This model consists of interrupting the animals’ social network, alternating periods of
isolation and crowding with
membership rotation.  Although few studies have used this model and
the protocols used in these studies diﬀer, the results have shown
changes in the HPA axis in both rats and mice.  These studies also describe anxiety and depressive-like behavioral changes in conventional

behavioral tests, but data are still inconclusive [14–17].  Moreover, the
eﬀects of CSI on the immune and monoaminergic systems, which play
an essential role in the pathology of depression [18,19], are unknown. 
A large body of evidence supports the association between increases
in the production of inﬂammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and the pathogenesis
of aﬀective disorders [20,21].  These data have been supported by animal models in which psychosocial stress, in addition to resulting in
inﬂammatory immune activation, produces behavioral changes associated with depression.  An increase in inﬂammatory cytokine levels has
also been observed in brain structures involved in aﬀective disorders,
such as the prefrontal cortex, amygdale and hippocampus [22,23]. 
Although most research has focused on the increase of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, several studies indicate that an imbalance between pro- and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines can produce lasting
changes in brain function and attribute a protective role to anti-inﬂammatory cytokines, such as IL −10, thereby highlighting their role
in depressive behavior [24,25]. 
Many studies have focused on the impact of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines on monoaminergic function.  Speciﬁcally,
the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), activated by pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, metabolizes TRYP into KYN, leading to serotonin reduction,
which has been implicated in depression [26].  In addition, the activation of kynurenine metabolic pathways may lead to the formation of
neurotoxic products, including 3-HK, a precursor of the quinolinic acid
[27] which increase has been associated with severe depression [28]. 
Pro-inﬂammatory cytokines may also aﬀect monoaminergic transmission by increasing the function of their reuptake pumps and/or decreasing the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a key enzyme cofactor in the synthesis of all monoamines [29]. 
In the context of this work, which analyzes the eﬀects of social stress
on females, in addition to the well-documented inﬂuence of the HPA
axis in the regulation of immune function [30], the role of female sex
steroids must be also considered.  The modulation of immune responses
by estrogen is complex because it may increase or decrease the production of inﬂammatory cytokines depending on the context, its concentration or type of receptor to which it binds [31].  Estrogens, similar
to other sex steroids, alter the functioning of immune cells by binding to
speciﬁc receptors that are expressed in the immune system.  In the brain,
ERα and ERβ have been identiﬁed in glial cells [32], and some studies
suggest that estrogen exhibits anti-inﬂammatory properties by binding
to ERβ [33].  In this sense, it has been observed that estrogens modulate
inﬂammation in the hippocampus and anxiety and depressive-like behaviors via ERβ [34]. 
In this work, we studied in female mice the eﬀect of CSI on behavior
and diﬀerent systems associated to stress related aﬀective disorders.  For
this purpose, we assessed behavior in the FST and sucrose preference
test (SPT), as well as barbering behavior, since this behavior was observed in stressed mice throughout the experiment.  We also measured
hippocampal changes in the expression of the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and the anti-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-10
as well as monoaminergic activity.  Taking into account the relationship
between monoaminergic and immune activity, the expression of IDO
and the levels of TRYP, KYN and 3-HK in the same brain structure were
measured.  The hippocampus was chosen because, in addition to interacting with other structures related to depression, such as the prefrontal
cortex, amygdala and striatum, it is also a structure that is particularly
sensitive to the eﬀects of stress and sex hormones [35].  Moreover, it
plays an important role in the stress-induced inﬂammatory response
[36].  Finally, we assessed the eﬀect of this chronic stress model on the
HPA and HPG systems by measuring the levels of plasma corticosterone
and estradiol and their receptors in the brain.  In addition, estrous cycle
was also studied. 
<Middle> Materials and methods. 
2. 1.  Animals
Sixty-two 8-week-old female CD1 mice (Janvier Labs, France) were
housed in groups of three for 7 days in transparent plastic cages measuring 24. 5 × 24. 5 × 15 cm.  Food and water were available ad libitum. 
The holding room was maintained at a constant temperature of 20 °C
with a reversed 12-h light/dark cycle (white lights on from 20:00 to
08:00 h), to enable mouse manipulation during the animal’s active
phase (dark).  All experimental procedures were conducted under dim
red light conditions in a room adjacent to the holding facility.  The
European regulations for the care and treatment of experimental animals were followed, and the procedures were controlled and approved
by the Diputación Foral de Gipuzkoa, Spain, in compliance with the
European Directive (2010/63/EU) on the protection of animals used for
scientiﬁc purposes (22 September 2010).  The procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee for animal welfare of the Basque
Country University (CEBA). 
2. 2.  Experimental procedure
The experiment began after a 7-day adaptation period.  A control
group (n = 30) and a group of socially stressed mice (n = 32) were
established.  Chronic social instability stress was applied to the stress
group during a 28-day period.  The control mice remained in same
conditions as the habituation time.  Blood was collected via submandibular vein puncture on days 1 and 25 for all subjects (N = 62) to
measure plasma corticosterone levels.  Body weight was measured at the
beginning and at the end of stress period.  Vaginal smears were collected
at the start (days 1–4) and at the end (days 25–28) of the procedure to
determine the estrous cycle phase.  On day 29, half of the animals from
the control group (n = 15) and half from the stressed group (n = 16)
were sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation.  Blood was immediately collected by cardiac puncture to determinate plasma estradiol concentration, the brain was removed, and the whole hypothalamus and hippocampi were dissected and analyzed.  All dissections were performed
under sterile conditions and stereomicroscopic observation with reference to the mouse brain atlas [37].  These samples were stored at
−80 °C until they were used for biological measurements.  After the
mice were sacriﬁced, a barbering assessment was performed.  On day
29, the remaining stressed (n = 16) and control (n = 15) mice were
singly housed to perform the sucrose preference and food intake test for
24 h.  Then, the control mice were returned to their original cage mates,
while the stressed mice remained isolated until the forced swimming
test was performed on day 31.  Finally, the animals were sacriﬁced. 
Barbering was not assessed in this case, because isolation prevented this
behavior.  (Fig.  1). 
2. 3.  Stress procedure
The female mice were stressed using the chronic social instability
stress model, which was adapted and modiﬁed from a protocol described by Haller Name [12] in rats and by Schmidt Name [14] in mice. 
The mice were exposed to a highly unstable social situation with alternating phases of isolation (1 day) and crowding (4 per cage, during
3 days) over 28 days.  During each crowding phase, we ensured that
four diﬀerent mice that had no previous contact were placed together in
a new clean cage. 
2. 4.  Behavioral assessment
2. 4. 1.  SPT and food intake
The control and stressed mice that were assigned to the behavioral
tests were individually housed and were oﬀered a free choice between
two bottles for 24 h; one bottle contained a 0. 8% sucrose solution, andA.  Labaka Name

Fig.  1.  Experimental procedure. 
one bottle contained water.  To prevent the possible eﬀects of a side
preference in drinking, the position of the bottles was counterbalanced. 
At the same time, the mice were provided four pellets.  The animals
were not deprived of food or water before the test.  The consumption of
the sucrose solution, water and food was measured by weighing the
bottles and the pellets at the beginning and end of the test.  The consumption of sucrose and food was expressed in relation to body weight. 
The sucrose preference was calculated as percentage of sucrose consumption vs.  sucrose plus water consumption. 
2. 4. 2.  FST
Individual mice were placed in glass cylinders (height 18. 5 cm and
diameter 12. 5 cm) containing 13. 5 cm of water at 25 ± 1° C for 6 min. 
The test was performed 24 h after the SPT and was recorded for subsequent assessment.  The following behaviors were assessed:
immobility, swimming and climbing.  The latency, frequency and time
spent engaged in each behavior were recorded manually by an experimenter blinded to the stress condition, using The Observer 4. 0
program (Noldus, ITC, Wageningen, Netherlands). 
2. 4. 3.  Whisking assessment
As the mice showed no traces of barbering on any body parts other
than the snout, we speciﬁcally examined whisking signs at the moment
of sacriﬁce.  Whisking is a type of hetero-barbering in which the socalled barber holds a cage mate down and cuts its vibrissae with its
incisors [38,39].  Whisker length was assessed by a trained observer and
classiﬁed using the following two-point scale: (1) intact whiskers— for
no deterioration of the vibrissae and (2) shortened whiskers—for
shortening or removal of the vibrissae. 
2. 5.  Physiological determinations
2. 5. 1.  Blood collection and plasma isolation
The blood was collected from all subjects (N = 62) by submandibular vein puncture on days 1 and 25 between 9:00 and 10:00
a. m.  for the corticosterone measurement.  On day 29, after analyzing
vaginal smears, the blood was collected by cardiac puncture (n = 31)
for the estradiol measurement.  The blood was stored in heparinized
containers and then centrifuged at 1800 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.  The
resulting plasma was collected and stored at −70 °C until it was assayed. 2. 5. 2.  Determination of plasma corticosterone concentrations
The plasma corticosterone concentrations (ng/ml) at days 1 and 25
were determined using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay
kit (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and a Synergy HT microplate
reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc. , Winooski, VT, USA).  The sensitivity of
the assay was 5 pg/ml, and the intra- and inter-assay variation coeﬃcients were 7% and 8%, respectively. 
2. 5. 3.  Determination of plasma estradiol (E2) concentrationsavailable
commercially
The plasma estradiol concentrations (ng/ml) at day 29 were determined using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Calbiotech, Spring Valley, CA, USA) and a Synergy
HT microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc. , Winooski, VT, USA). 
The sensitivity of the assay was 3 pg/ml, and the intra- and inter-assay
variation coeﬃcients were 3. 1% and 9. 9%, respectively. 
2. 5. 4.  Determination of estrous cycle phases
The vaginal smears were collected during days 1–4 and 25–28 from
all subjects using a cotton swab dampened with saline.  Then, the smears
were microscopically analyzed to identify the phases of the estrous
cycle using the following standard criteria [40]: (a) proestrous was
characterized by a predominance of nucleated epithelial cells; (b) estrous was characterized by large clumps of anucleated corniﬁed cells;
(c) metestrous was characterized by the same proportions of leukocytes,
corniﬁed, and nucleated epithelial cells; and (d) diestrous was characterized by a predominance of leukocytes. 
2. 5. 5.  Real-Time RT −PCR measurements of mRNA expression in the
hypothalamus and hippocampus
The total RNA of each structure was isolated using the NucleoSpin
RNA Plus kit (Macherey Nagel, Germany).  A UV spectrophotometric
analysis was performed at 260 nm to determine the RNA concentrations, while the 260:280 absorbance ratio was utilized to assess the
nucleic acid purity.  (Synergy HT, BioTek Instruments, Inc. , Winooski,
VT, USA).  The total RNA was then reverse-transcribed with the
PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara Bio Inc. , Madrid, Spain).  The resulting
SYBR Green-based
(SYBR®Premix Ex TaqTM, Takara Bio Inc. , Madrid, Spain) real-time
PCR, and the formation of PCR products was monitored using the 7500
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Madrid, Spain).  The cDNA
sequences were obtained from GenBank at the National Center for
cDNA levels were

transferase (HPRT) and glyceraldehyde-6phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were used as the reference genes. 
The primer sequences were designed using Primer Express Software
v3. 0 (Applied Biosystems, Madrid, Spain), and obtained from Applied
Biosystems (Table 1).  The relative gene expression was determined
using the 2−DΔt method [41]. 
2. 5. 6.  Determination of hippocampal monoamines, their metabolites and
amino acids by HPLC(DOPAC),
To determine the monoaminergic activity in the hippocampus, the
dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) levels were
analyzed, as well as their respective metabolite levels, including: 3,4dihydroxyphenylacetic
3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA).  The
serotonin precursor TRYP, KYN, and 3-HK were also determined.  All the
analytes were analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC).  The HPLC equipment comprised an Agilent 1200 LC system
(Agilent Technologies, Madrid, Spain) equipped with a vacuum degasser, quaternary pump, cooled autosampler, thermostted column
compartment, and ﬂuorescence and variable wavelength detectors.  The
chromatographic separation was performed on a Poroshell 120 EC-C18
column (100 × 4. 6 mm, 2. 7 μm) protected by a cartridge guard column
(Agilent Technologies).  The mobile phase comprised 0. 05% triﬂuoroacetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B).  The ﬂow was
maintained at a constant rate of 0. 5 ml/min.  The gradient elution
program was as follows: from 0 to 8 min, 6% solvent B (v/v); from 8 to
15 min, 10% solvent B (v/v); from 15 to 22 min, 20% solvent B (v/v);
and from 22 to 25 min, 2% solvent B (v/v).  The column was maintained
at 30 °C during the analysis, and the samples were maintained at 4 °C in
an autosampler unit.  The eﬄuent was monitored with the ﬂuorescence
detector at the emission wavelengths of 320 nm for DA, DOPAC, NA
and MHPG and 366 nm for 5-HT, 5-HIAA and TRYP.  For these analyses,
the excitation wavelength was 210 nm.  The eﬄuent of KYN and 3-HK
was monitored with variable wavelength detector set at 360 nm.  The
total sample analysis time was 25 min. 
Prior to the sample preparation, the frozen tissues were weighed on
AG204 analytical scales (Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. , Columbus,
OH, USA).  The tissues were homogenized and deproteinized in 60 μl
homogenization solution (1% formic acid in acetonitrile) in a Bullet
Blender homogenizer (BBY24 M Bullet Blender Storm, Next, Advance,
New York, USA).  The homogenate processing, calibration curve preparation, and data processing were performed as previously described
[42].  The ﬁnal data were expressed as pg/mg wet tissue.  Regarding the
KYN data, the samples for which the absorbance intensity was very low
and could not be converted to an observed concentration (16 of 31
samples) were assigned the lowest detectable concentration. 
2. 6.  Statistical analysis
All the statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 22 for
Windows (SPSS Inc. , Chicago, Ill. , USA) with the level of signiﬁcance
set at p < 0. 05.  The criterion of normality and homogeneity was respected, and outliers were eliminated in accordance with the boxplot
outlier labeling rule.  The behavioral and physiological variables were
analyzed using one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA for repeated
measures.  Diﬀerences in estrous cycle phases duration and whisking
behavior were analyzed using McNemar’s test and Fisher’s exact test,
respectively. 
3.  Results
3. 1.  Eﬀect of CSI on the SPT, food intake and body weight
The analysis of variance showed that chronically stressed mice
consumed less sucrose solution in relation to body weight than the
control group (F[1,30] = 5. 174; p = 0. 031).  When sucrose preference
was analyzed, the control mice showed a preference of 72,6%, compared to the 60,4% of the stressed mice, but this diﬀerence did not
reach the signiﬁcation level (F[1,30] = 2. 38; p = 0. 133) (Fig.  2).  No
diﬀerences were found for food intake (F[1,30] = 0. 03; p = 0. 854) or
body weight gain (F[1,30] = 1. 17; p = 0. 28). 
3. 2.  Eﬀect of CSI on the FST
The analysis of variance showed that stressed mice performed
climbing with a higher frequency (F[1,29] = 6. 75; p = 0. 015) and that
they spent more time engaged in this behavior (F[1,29] = 6. 24;
p = 0. 018) (Fig.  3a, b).  No diﬀerences were found between the groups
as regards either frequency of immovility (F[1,29] = 0. 03; p = 0. 856) or
swimming (F[1,29] = 1. 78; p = 0. 192).  Nor were any diﬀerences in the
immobility (F[1,29] = 0. 30; p = 0. 582) and swimming

Fisher’s exact test showed that CSI aﬀected the whisker length.  In
the stress group, 83% of the subjects showed shortened whiskers,

3. 4. 1.  Plasma corticosterone concentration
Two-way ANOVA (group and time) with repeated measures showed
signiﬁcant diﬀerences for the time factor (F[1,60] = 23. 08; p < 0. 001)
and for the time x group interaction (F[1,60] = 10. 04; p = 0. 002).  In
relation to time factor, the analysis revealed an increase in corticosterone in both groups.  Regarding the time x group interaction, the data
showed a higher increase in the corticosterone levels from day 1 to day
25 in the stressed group than in the control group.  Accordingly, the
change variable showed a signiﬁcantly pronounced increase for the
stress mice compared with the control mice (F[1,60] = 4. 18;
p = 0. 045) (Fig.  5a). 
Hypothalamic mRNA expression of GR and MR.  The stressed group
showed lower GR expression levels (F[1,29] = 11. 43; p = 0. 002) than
the control group when ANOVA was performed.  No diﬀerences were
found for the MR mRNA expression levels (F[1,29] = 2. 20; p = 0. 151) or
the ratio between the two receptors (F[1,29] = 3. 32; p = 0. 081) in the
hypothalamus (Fig.  5b). 
3. 5.  Eﬀect of CSI on plasma estradiol levels, the hypothalamic and
hippocampal mRNA relative expression levels of ER-α and ER-β and the
estrous cycle
The analysis of variance revealed no diﬀerences between the groups
as regards either plasma estradiol levels (F[1,30] = 0. 75; p = 0. 099)
(Fig.  6. a) or mRNA expression levels of ER-α and ER-β in the hypothalamus (F[1,29] = 1. 16; p = 0. 292 and F[1,29] = 0. 97; p = 0. 333
respectively) (Fig.  6. b) or hippocampus (F[1,29] = 0. 23; p = 0. 631 and
F[1,29] = 0. 84; p = 0. 367, respectively) (Fig.  6. c).  Nor were any differences observed in the ratio between them in either the hypothalamus
(F[1,29] = 0. 17; p = 0. 684) or
(F[1,29] = 1. 48;
p = 0. 236).  McNemar’s test showed that the phases of the estrous cycle
of the experimental group at the end of the stress model lasted longer
than at baseline.  Speciﬁcally, in 80% of control mice phases were observed to last for the same amount of time (df = 1, N = 30; p = 0. 687),
while this was true for only 41% of the stressed mice (df = 1, N = 32;
p < 0. 001).

<Conclusion> Discussion. (F[1,27] = 3. 68;
The analysis of variance showed that the stressed mice (n = 15) had
lower hippocampal IL-10 mRNA levels than the control mice (n = 13)
(F[1,27] = 5. 55; p = 0. 027) (Fig.  7a).  The remainder of the measured
cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) did not show signiﬁcant diﬀerences
F[1,27] = 1. 04;
between the
p = 0. 315 and F[1,27] = 1. 20; p = 0. 283, respectively).  However, when
studying the cytokine balance, the stressed mice showed higher overall
IL-1β/IL-10(F[1,27] = 11. 42; p = 0. 002), IL-6/IL-10 (F[1,27] = 5. 39; p = 0. 029) and
TNF-α/IL10 (F[1,27] = 27. 17; p < 0. 001) (Fig.  7b).  The mRNA expression level of IDO did not diﬀer between the groups (F[1,27] = 1. 60;

(Fig.  8a).  In addition, the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was higher in the stress

groups, but the MHPG/NA ratio was higher (F[1,26] = 6. 34; p = 0. 019)
in the stressed mice (Fig.  8c,d).  Stress mice showed lower DA
(F[1,26] = 4. 98; p = 0. 035) and DOPAC (F[1,26] = 7. 07; p = 0. 018) levels, while the groups did not diﬀer
in the DOPAC/DA ratio
(F[1,26] = 0. 14; p = 0. 710) (Fig.  8e,f).  No diﬀerences were found in
TRYP, KYN and 3-HK (Table 2). 
To our knowledge, the results of the present study show, for the ﬁrst
time, that CSI produces in female mice a decrease in the expression of
hippocampal IL-10 and changes in the central monoaminergic activity
and HPA axis accompanied by behavioral changes that suggest an anxiety and depressive-like phenotype. 
In this study, we observed that CSI produced anhedonia, considered
a central symptom of depression.  Stressed mice presented a reduction in
sucrose solution (0. 8%) consumption measured over a 24-h.  This reduction was not a consequence of a decrease in the volume of ﬂuids
ingested or a decrease in eating behavior since the consumption of
water and food did not vary with stress.  An anhedonic eﬀect produced
by this stress paradigm has been previously described in rats [17], but
not in all studies [43,44].  Among other factors, these discrepancies may
be due to diﬀerences in the stress protocol and the method used to
assess anhedonia.  However, as in Herzog Name [17], the FST did not
show changes in immobility, which is considered a depressive-like behavior.  Nevertheless, we did observe an increase in the frequency and
time dedicated to climbing behavior in stressed mice.  Climbing is
considered an active behavior, but its increase has also been previously
interpreted as an anxiety index in male rats following CSI administration [45].  In this regard, corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) overexpressing mice display increased active behaviors in the FST, interpreted as active-coping behavior related to a high arousal state [46],
something which may indicate a transition towards a pathological response to stress [47]. 
Other authors observed that CSI exposure resulted in an increase in
anxiety-like behaviors in females, as evidenced by an increased inhibition of consumption in the novel palatable food test, although a
comparable eﬀect was not observed in the plus maze [14].  Jarcho Name
[16] also did not ﬁnd diﬀerences between stressed female mice and
controls in the time invested in center/periphery or open/closed arms,they did identify diﬀerences in rearing behavior, which is

considered an indicator of anxiety [48,49].  Interestingly, during behavioral tests for depression and anxiety, a series of behaviors diﬀerent
from those routinely used to describe anxiety and depressive-like behaviors are manifested, such as rearing, climbing, and head shaking. 
Detecting changes in these behaviors can be important in interpreting
behavior and adjusting behavioral indexes to correctly reﬂect anxiety
and depressive status in both sexes [50].  This adjustment is important
because, in humans, sexual diﬀerences have been reported in the
symptoms of depression, being more likely to occur in women along
with anxiety symptoms [3,51]. 
Moreover, assessing the behaviors of mice interacting with each
other during exposure to social instability may help to elucidate the
eﬀects of stress.  Thus, the present study assessed barbering or fur/
whisker trimming, which when excessive and repetitive, may represent
pathological behavior such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in
mice [52,53], and which is accompanied by an increase in central dopaminergic activity [54].  However, the mice in this experiment displayed only whisking behavior, with no generalized barbering of the
whole body being observed.  Whisking aﬀects the vibrissae of the
muzzle when directed at a conspeciﬁc and depends on sex and the
mouse strain [39,53,55].  It has been linked to the establishment of
social hierarchies and may also represent a stress-induced behavioral
response [39].  Vibrissae cutting, on the other hand, is an essential behavior since rodents actively use their whiskers to interact with the
environment [56,57], which is why altering their status in mice may
disorient the animal, thereby contributing to a state of anxiety [39]. 
Thus, we observed that a very high percentage of stressed mice had
shortened vibrissae in this study, whereas they remained intact in allA.  Labaka Name

control animals, a ﬁnding which supports the hypothesis of increased
anxious behavior in stressed females. 
Notably, the behaviors manifested in various behavioral tests and
physiological variables have been shown to diﬀer based on the sex
hormone levels corresponding to each phase of the estrous cycle, although not all data point in this direction [58–60].  Although CSI
resulted in a high percentage of females presenting longer-lasting cycle
phases in this study, the estradiol levels and the expression of hypothalamic and hippocampal ERs did not diﬀer either depending on
stress.  Thus, estrogens did not seem to inﬂuence anhedonic behavior or
other biological variables measured at day 29.  However, it would have
been interesting to have measured the estrus cycle stage on each behavioral testing day as an indirect measure of estradiol and also progesterone, the eﬀects of which on the variables analyzed cannot be
ruled out [61]. 
Stress also produced an increase in noradrenergic and serotoninergic activity, as evidenced by increases in the MHPG/NA and 5HIAA/5-HT ratios in the hippocampus, which have been associated
with active FST behaviors, such as climbing and swimming, respectively [45,62,63].
