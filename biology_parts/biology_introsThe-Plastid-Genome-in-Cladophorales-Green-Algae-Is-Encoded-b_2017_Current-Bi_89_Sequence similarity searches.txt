https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 004Virtually all plastid (chloroplast) genomes are circular double-stranded DNA molecules, typically between 100 and 200 kb in size and encoding circa
80–250 genes.  Exceptions to this universal plastid
genome architecture are very few and include the
dinoﬂagellates, where genes are located on DNA
minicircles.  Here we report on the highly deviant
chloroplast genome of Cladophorales green algae,
which is entirely fragmented into hairpin chromosomes.  Short- and long-read high-throughput
sequencing of DNA and RNA demonstrated that
the chloroplast genes of Boodlea composita are
encoded on 1- to 7-kb DNA contigs with an exceptionally high GC content, each containing a long inverted repeat with one or two protein-coding genes
and conserved non-coding regions putatively
involved in replication and/or expression.  We propose that
these contigs correspond to linear
single-stranded DNA molecules that fold onto themselves to form hairpin chromosomes.  The Boodlea
chloroplast genes are highly divergent from their
corresponding orthologs, and display an alternative
genetic code.  The origin of this highly deviant chloroplast genome most likely occurred before the
emergence of the Cladophorales, and coincided
with an elevated transfer of chloroplast genes
to the nucleus.  A chloroplast genome thatcomposed only of linear DNA molecules is unprecedented among eukaryotes, and highlights unexpected variation in plastid genome architecture. 
INTRODUCTION
Photosynthetic eukaryotes possibly originated 1. 9 billion years
ago following an endosymbiotic event in which a heterotrophic
ancestor of the Archaeplastida engulfed a cyanobacterium that
became stably integrated and evolved into a membrane-bound
organelle, the plastid [1, 2].  Following this primary endosymbiosis, an intricate history of plastid acquisition via eukaryoteeukaryote endosymbioses resulted in the spread of plastids to
distantly related eukaryotic lineages [3]. 
Plastids have retained a reduced version of the genome inherited from their cyanobacterial ancestor.  A core set of genes
involved in the light reactions of photosynthesis, ATP generation,
and functions related to transcription and translation is typically
retained [4].  Many genes have been lost or transferred to the nuclear genome and, as a result, plastids are dependent on nuclear-encoded, plastid-targeted proteins for the maintenance
of essential biochemical pathways and other functions such as
genome replication, gene expression, and DNA repair [5].  Nearly
all plastid genomes consist of a single circular-mapping chromosome, typically between 100 and 200 kb and encoding circa
80–250 genes [4, 6].  Diversity in size, gene content, density,
and organization of plastid genomes among different eukaryotic
lineages [7–9] is by and large limited, especially when compared
to mitochondria. 
Whereas fragmented mitochondrial genomes evolved several
times independently during the evolution of eukaryotes [8, 10],
fragmented plastid genomes are only known in dinoﬂagellates
[11] and a single green algal species [12].  In peridinin-containing
dinoﬂagellates,
the chloroplast genome is fragmented into
DNA minicircles of 2–3 kb, most of which carry one gene only
[11, 13].  Larger minicircles of up to 12 kb have also been
described [14], as well as minicircles containing two genes [15]
and ‘‘empty’’ minicircles without genes [16].  The genes located
on these minicircles mostly encode key components of the major

plasmid-like DNA that has been observed
in the chloroplasts of several species
[29, 30].  These plasmid-like DNA molecules represent a low-molecular-weight
(LMW) DNA fraction, visible on agarose
gels of total DNA extracts (Figure 1D).  Pioneering work revealed that these structures are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
molecules of 1. 5–3. 0 kb that fold into a
hairpin conﬁguration and lack sequence
similarity to the nuclear DNA [31, 32]. the hairpin-like DNAs contain
putatively transcribed sequences with
similarity to chloroplast genes encoding
(psaB, psbB, psbC, and
subunits of photosystems I and II
psbF) [31]. 
Here we describe intriguing features of the plastid genome of
Cladophorales, focusing on Boodlea composita.  Through the
integration of different DNA sequencing methods, combined
with RNA sequencing, we found that chloroplast protein-coding
genes are highly expressed and encoded on 1- to 7-kb linear
ssDNA molecules.  Due to the widespread presence of inverted
repeats, these molecules fold into a hairpin conﬁguration.  A chloroplast genome that is composed only of linear DNA molecules is
unprecedented among eukaryotes, and highlights unexpected
variation in plastid genome architecture. 
<Middle> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. 
DNA and RNA Sequencing Data
Our reconstruction of the chloroplast genome of B.  composita is
based on different high-throughput DNA sequencing methods
(Figure S1; STAR Methods).  The choice of short-read DNA
sequencing of isolated intact chloroplasts (chloroplast-enriched
fraction) using Roche 454 technology was based on comparable
sequencing approaches in other plants and algae that successfully resulted in assembly of chloroplast genomes [25].  To overcome possible assembly artifacts in a hypothetical scenario of
an inﬂated chloroplast genome bloated by repetitive elements,
long-read sequencing ofDNA fraction using the Paciﬁc Biosciences Single-Molecule
Real-Time (SMRT) method was applied, whereas long-read
sequencing of the LMW DNA fraction allowed characterization
of the previously observed plasmid-like DNA in the chloroplast
[29, 30].  To allow comparison of the results of Boodlea with
the high-molecular-weight
photosynthetic complexes, including subunits of photosystems I
and II, the cytochrome b6f complex, and ATP synthase, as well
as rRNAs and a few tRNAs [11].  The only other alga with a fragmented chloroplast genome is the green alga Koshicola spirodelophila, but here the level of fragmentation is minor: the plastid
genome is divided into three large circular chromosomes totaling
385 kb, with a gene content comparable to other green algae
[12].  In addition, plastid minicircles that coexist with a conventional plastid genome have been observed in a few algae,
including dinoﬂagellates with haptophyte-derived plastids [17]
and the green alga Acetabularia [18, 19]. 
Although plastid genomes generally assemble as circularmapping DNAs, they can take multiple complex conformations
in vivo, including multigenomic, linear-branched structures with
discrete termini [20, 21].  The alveolate Chromera velia is the
only known alga with a linear-mapping plastid genome with telomeric arrangement [22], and is also atypical in that several core
photosynthesis genes are fragmented.  Linear plastid genomes,
however, may be more widespread, as several plastid genomes
currently do not map as a circle [23]. 
Currently, and in stark contrast to other algae [9, 24–26], little
is known about the gene content and structure of the chloroplast genome in the Cladophorales (Ulvophyceae), an ecologically important group of marine and freshwater green algae,
which includes several hundreds of species.  These macroscopic multicellular algae have giant, multinucleate cells containing numerous chloroplasts (Figures 1A–1C).  Most attempts
to amplify common chloroplast genes have failed [27], with only
one highly divergent rbcL sequence published thus far for
Chaetomorpha valida [28].  An atypical plastid genome in
the Cladophorales is suggested by the presence of abundant

other species of Cladophorales, we generated additional DNA
sequence data from nine other species using Illumina HiSeq 2000
technology.  Finally, two deep-coverage RNA-seq (sequencing)
libraries, a total-RNA library, and an mRNA library enriched for
nuclear transcripts were generated to conﬁrm the transcription
of genes and to inform whether genes are nuclear versus plastid
encoded. 
A Prodigious Chloroplast Genome with a Reduced
Gene Set
Assembly of the chloroplast-enriched DNA reads generated using Roche 454 technology did not result in a typical circular chloroplast genome.  Instead, 21 chloroplast protein-coding genes
were found on 58 short contigs (1,203–5,426 bp): atpA, atpB,
atpH, atpI, petA, petB, petD, psaA, psaB, psaC, psbA, psbB,
psbC, psbD, psbE, psbF, psbJ, psbK, psbL, psbT, and rbcL. 
All but the rbcL gene code for components of the major thylakoid
transmembrane protein complexes (ATP synthase, cytochrome
b6f, and photosystems I and II).  The contigs contained inverted
repeats at their termini and, despite high coverage by sequence
reads, could not be extended by iterative contig extension. 
Sequence similarity searches and a metagenomic binning
approach (distribution analysis of 4-mers) demonstrated that
the inverted repeats were also found on contigs with no
sequence similarity to known proteins, raising the number of
contigs of chloroplast origin to 136.  These contigs are further
referred to as ‘‘chloroplast 454 contigs.
