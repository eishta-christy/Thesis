https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 018Sleep is an essential and evolutionarily conserved
behavioral state whose regulation remains poorly understood.  To identify genes that regulate vertebrate
sleep, we recently performed a genetic screen in
zebraﬁsh, and here we report the identiﬁcation of
neuropeptide Y (NPY) as both necessary for normal
daytime sleep duration and sufﬁcient to promote
sleep.  We show that overexpression of NPY increases sleep, whereas mutation of npy or ablation
of npy-expressing neurons decreases sleep.  By
analyzing sleep architecture, we show that NPY
regulates sleep primarily by modulating the length
of wake bouts.  To determine how NPY regulates
sleep, we tested for
interactions with several
systems known to regulate sleep, and provide
anatomical, molecular, genetic, and pharmacological evidence that NPY promotes sleep by inhibiting
noradrenergic signaling.  These data establish NPY
as an important vertebrate sleep/wake regulator
and link NPY signaling to an established arousal-promoting system. 
INTRODUCTION
Sleep is among the most basic needs of living organisms, yet
mechanisms that regulate sleep remain poorly understood. 
Several neuropeptides have been implicated in regulating
mammalian sleep [1], including hypocretin [2–4], which promotes wakefulness, and galanin [5–8] and melanin-concentrating hormone [9–12], which promote sleep, suggesting that
examining additional neuropeptides may identify novel mechanisms that regulate sleep.  Identifying these mechanisms using
mammalian models has been challenging due to their poor
amenability for large-scale screens, although such screens are
possible [13].  As an alternative approach, several groups have
used behavioral criteria to study sleep-like states in simpler
model organisms that are amenable to screens,
including
Drosophila [14–22], C.  elegans [23–25], and zebraﬁsh [26–30]. 
In particular, several groups have demonstrated behavioral,
anatomical, genetic, and pharmacological conservation of sleep
between zebraﬁsh and mammals, establishing zebraﬁsh as a
vertebrate sleep model [26–28, 30–33].  We previously described
a screen for genes whose overexpression affects zebraﬁsh
sleep, and reported that the neuropeptide neuromedin U is
necessary and sufﬁcient for normal levels of arousal [29].  Here
we demonstrate that another neuropeptide identiﬁed in the
screen, neuropeptide Y (NPY), is necessary for daytime sleep
and sufﬁcient to promote sleep. 
injection of
NPY is widely expressed in the brain and has been implicated
in regulating endocrine, behavioral, and circadian processes
[34], and is perhaps best known for its role in promoting feeding
[35–38].  NPY has also been shown to affect sleep, but its role in
this behavioral state remains unclear.  Several studies have
shown that
in vitro-synthesized NPY into the
rodent brain [39–45] or intravenously into young healthy [46] or
depressed [47] humans can induce sleep or reduce locomotor
activity.  However, other rodent studies reported the opposite effect [48–50].  The basis for these disparate reports is unclear, but
may be due to different sites and doses of NPY injection, or the
use of in vitro-synthesized peptide that may vary in different
preparations and from endogenous NPY.  Understanding the
role of NPY in mammalian sleep is also confounded by links
between mechanisms that regulate feeding and sleep [48–51]. reports of wake promotion by injected NPY also
observed increased feeding [48–50], suggesting thatincreased wakefulness may result
from increased feeding. 
npy mutant mice exhibit several phenotypes, including increased
anxiety, depression-like behavior, and cognitive deﬁcits [52, 53],
and are less susceptible to diet-induced obesity [54].  However,
an analysis of sleep in these animals and a role for npy-expressing neurons in sleep have not been described.  As a result, the
role of NPY in vertebrate sleep remains unclear. 
Here we show that NPY is sufﬁcient to promote sleep in zebraﬁsh, whereas loss of npy or npy-expressing neurons results in
less daytime sleep.  We also show that NPY promotes sleep by
inhibiting the wake-promoting noradrenergic system, providing
a mechanistic basis for sleep regulation by NPY.  Together with
the requirement of noradrenergic signaling for the wake-promoting function of hypocretin [55, 56], these results suggest that the
noradrenergic system integrates neuropeptidergic signals that
regulate sleep/wake states.

Figure 1.  Overexpression of Zebraﬁsh NPY Increases Sleep and Arousal Threshold
(A–G) Overexpression of zebraﬁsh NPY following a heat shock at 3 p. m.  resulted in decreased locomotor activity (A and B) and increased sleep (C and D), due to
more sleep bouts (E) and shorter sleep (F) and wake (G) bouts.  Yellow bars indicate heat shock (HS).  Pre-HS and post-HS quantify data for day 5 before and
after HS.  Mean ± SEM from four experiments is shown. 
(H) Representative stimulus-response curve for Tg(hsp:npy) animals compared to WT siblings following HS.  Data points represent mean ± SEM.  Dashed lines
mark ETP50 value for each genotype.  Tg(hsp:npy) animals had an ETP50 value of 24. 2 versus 8. 2 for WT siblings (293% increase, p < 0. 05 by extra sum-of-squares
F test).
