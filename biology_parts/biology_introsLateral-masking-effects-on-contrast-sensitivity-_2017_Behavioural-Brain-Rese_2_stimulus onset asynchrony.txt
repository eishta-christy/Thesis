Visibility of stimulus components may be enhanced or diminished
by the presence of adjacent stimulus elements.  Such eﬀects are evident
with high-contrast lateral masks [1], metacontrast with zero stimulus
onset asynchrony [2], and crowding of peripheral targets [3].  Contextual eﬀects on perceptual capacities may reﬂect neural interactions
among representations of targets and lateral masks.
