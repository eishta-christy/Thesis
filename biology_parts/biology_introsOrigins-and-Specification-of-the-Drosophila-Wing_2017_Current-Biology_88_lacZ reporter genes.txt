In Brief
By studying a cis-regulatory module that
is speciﬁcally active in the embryonic
dorsal (wing and haltere) primordia of
Drosophila, Requena Name demonstrate
that dorsal fates are derived from two
separate groups of cells, one of which
shares a lineage with the ventral
primordia.  These data are consistent with
a dual evolutionary origin of the wing.

https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 023The insect wing is a key evolutionary innovation that
was essential for insect diversiﬁcation.  Yet despite
its importance, there is still debate about its evolutionary origins.  Two main hypotheses have been
proposed: the paranotal hypothesis, which suggests
that wings evolved as an extension of the dorsal
thorax, and the gill-exite hypothesis, which proposes
that wings were derived from a modiﬁcation of a
pre-existing branch at the dorsal base (subcoxa) of
the leg.  Here, we address this question by studying
how wing fates are initially speciﬁed during
Drosophila embryogenesis, by characterizing a cisregulatory module (CRM) from the snail (sna) gene,
sna-DP (for dorsal primordia).  sna-DP speciﬁcally
marks the early primordia for both the wing and haltere, collectively referred to as the DP.  We found that
the inputs that activate sna-DP are distinct from
those that activate Distalless, a marker for leg fates. 
Further, in genetic backgrounds in which the leg
primordia are absent, the DP are still partially speciﬁed.  However, lineage-tracing experiments demonstrate that cells from the early leg primordia
contribute to both ventral and dorsal appendage
fates.  Together, these results suggest that the wings
of Drosophila have a dual developmental origin: two
groups of cells, one ventral and one more dorsal, give
rise to the mature wing.  We suggest that the dual
developmental origins of the wing may be a molecularappendage, in which cells of the subcoxa of the leg
coalesced with dorsal outgrowths to evolve a dorsal
appendage with motor control.

INTRODUCTION
It is estimated that nearly three-quarters of the species currently
living on Earth are insects.  Although there have been several hypotheses to explain this vast diversity, one likely contributing factor was the acquisition of ﬂight due to the development of wings
approximately 350 million years ago, long before any vertebrate
acquired the ability to ﬂy [1, 2].  However, despite their importance to life on Earth, there is still debate about the evolutionary
origins of insect wings [3].  One set of ideas, collectively termed
the paranotal hypothesis, suggests that wings evolved as an
extension from a part of the dorsal thorax called the thoracic
tergum, or paranotal lobe [4, 5].  According to this hypothesis,
this anatomical outgrowth initially gave insects the ability to
glide, creating the opportunity for the evolution of wing anatomy
and function.  However, the paranotal lobe was unlikely to have
any musculature or neural innervation, raising signiﬁcant questions about how motor control of these dorsal outgrowths would
have evolved.  An alternative hypothesis proposes that wings
were derived from a modiﬁcation of a pre-existing branch at
the dorsal base of the leg, a region referred to as the subcoxa
[6–10].  In aquatic arthropods, this structure may have initially
evolved as a gill, specializing in gas exchange, and subsequently
modiﬁed to become a wing following terrestrialization of some
crustacean lineages. 
Two principal approaches have informed our current view of insect wing evolution.  One approach, which depends on careful examination of the fossil record to trace the origins of the wing, has
provided support for both a paranotal lobe and a subcoxa origin
[5–7, 11].  One limitation of this approach is that there is a large
gap in the fossil record that spans the period of time when wings
ﬁrst appeared.  An alternative approach relies on comparing the
expression patterns of molecular markers of appendages in extant
insects and crustaceans that may represent the early steps of
wing evolution [3].  With this approach, for example, genes that
are expressed in the developing wing of Drosophila melanogaster
were also found to be expressed in the subcoxal gills of branched
appendages in two different crustaceans, consistent with a subcoxal origin for the insect wing [8, 12].  Although compelling, these
types of studies also have their limitations.  For one, the presence
of similar markers in the ﬂy wing and non-wing structures such as
the crustacean gill could represent examples of convergent,
instead of divergent, evolution.  Second, many of the markers
used in these studies are expressed in both leg and wing precursors, or at late stages of development, making them less deﬁnitive
[13].  More recently, in two insects, wing markers were found to be
expressed in two separate domains, corresponding to the positions of dorsal outgrowths and subcoxal branches, providing evidence for the idea that wings evolved from a fusion of these two
initially distinct structures [3, 14, 15].  This dual-origin hypothesis

has also been supported by functional studies and recent fossil
analysis [11, 16–18]. 
A complementary approach that may help inform the origins of
insect appendages are experiments that characterize how the
wing and leg primordia are initially speciﬁed during development
using cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that are active in the
appendage primordia.  Not only are these CRMs useful as
markers, but they also can be used to genetically label and trace
the progeny of these primordia.  For example, the characterization of an early CRM from the Distalless (Dll) gene in Drosophila,
called Dll304, has already provided evidence for a subcoxal
origin of the wing [19, 20].  Although Dll function is not required
for the establishment of wing fates, Dll304 is active in a group
of 30 ventral cells early in embryogenesis, and the progeny of
these cells contribute to both the ventral (leg) and dorsal (wing
and haltere) appendages [20, 21].  Slightly later in embryogenesis, a different Dll CRM, called DllLT, is active in a subset of
the cells that previously expressed Dll304 [19–21].  Unlike
Dll304, DllLT-expressing cells only give rise to part of the leg
and do not contribute to dorsal appendages [21, 22].  In sum,
these experiments reveal that Dll-expressing ventral cells in the
early embryo contribute to both leg and wing fates, but soon
thereafter, the only adult structures that Dll-expressing cells
give rise to are legs (reviewed in [23]). 
To the extent that developmental studies in extant organisms
can be used to inform evolution, these ﬁndings are consistent
with a shared evolutionary origin of legs and wings.  However,
an important but currently missing test of this idea is to characterize CRMs that are speciﬁcally active in the dorsal (wing and
haltere) primordia (DP).  Although several genes, including vestigial (vg), snail (sna), and escargot (esg), are well-known embryonic markers of the DP in Drosophila, no CRMs have yet been
described that speciﬁcally label these cells [24–29].  Here, we
describe the ﬁrst such CRM that is speciﬁcally active in both
the wing and haltere primordia during Drosophila embryogenesis.  We use this CRM, derived from the sna gene, to analyze
the signals and transcription factors that are required for the
speciﬁcation of the DP.  We ﬁnd that the inputs that activate
this CRM are distinct from those that activate Dll, suggesting
that the DP are, at least in part, speciﬁed independently of the
ventral (leg) primordia (VP).  Moreover, in genetic backgrounds
in which the VP are absent or ablated, DP fates are still partially
speciﬁed.  Together, these results demonstrate that the dorsal
appendages of Drosophila have a dual developmental origin:
although some DP cells share a lineage with the VP, much of
the DP is independently derived from non-VP cells.  Based on
these developmental data in Drosophila, we discuss the idea
of a dual evolutionary origin of wings, in which cells of the subcoxa migrated and coalesced with dorsal outgrowths to evolve
a dorsal appendage with motor control.

Identiﬁcation of the sna-DP CRM
The formation of
the wing and haltere primordia requires
the function of sna and esg [27].  Although sna expression is
restricted to the DP, esg is also expressed in the VP [24–27]
(Figures 1B and 2A).  Therefore, we searched for CRMs of the
sna gene speciﬁcally active in the DP. 
Although multiple sna CRMs have been identiﬁed [30–32],
none of them drive expression in the DP.  An unbiased scan
of the locus identiﬁed a single fragment that had such activity;
notably, this fragment overlaps with VT7914 from the Vienna
Drosophila Resource Center (VDRC) that also shows activity
in the DP (Figure 1A).  We named this CRM sna-DP and used
it to drive lacZ reporter genes and compare its activity with
Dll during embryonic development (Figure 1B).  sna-DP was ﬁrst
detected at stage 12/13 in a few cells dorsal to Dll-expressing
cells in the second and third thoracic segments (T2 and T3,
respectively), and, by stage 14, the number of sna-DP cells in
T2 and T3 increased to an average number of 20 and 14 cells,
respectively.
