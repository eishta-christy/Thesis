Weight gain and obesity are a great health concern of the modern
Western world, in both Europe (Berghöfer Name, 2008) and the US
(Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, & Curtin, 2010) obesity has reached a prevalence of 30%.  Emotional eating, which is overeating during stress or
negative aﬀect seems to be an important factor in weight gain while it
increases food intake of speciﬁcally high fat and/or sweet foods
(Gibson, 2012; Greeno & Wing, 1994; Schepers & Markus, 2015).  The
cause of this unhealthy habit has not decisively been determined, although over the last years in both cognitive and biological scientiﬁc
ﬁelds this topic has been explored extensively.  For instance diﬀerences
in behavioral disinhibition (Guerrieri Name, 2007), attention bias
(Shafran, Lee, Cooper, Palmer, & Fairburn, 2007), restrained eating
styles (Greeno & Wing, 1994), heightened responses of reward areas of
the brain towards food related cues (Bohon, Stice, & Spoor, 2009) and
genetics (Keskitalo Name, 2008; Sung, Lee, Song, Lee, & Lee, 2010;
Tholin, Rasmussen, Tynelius, & Karlsson, 2005) all seem to partly explain emotional eating.  A system that is greatly involved in stress
resilience and therefore might play an important part in emotional
eating is the brain serotonergic (5-HT) system.  Dysfunction of this
neurotransmitter is associated with decreased stress resilience and increased intake of carbohydrate rich foods (Markus, 2008).  The serotonin transporter gene contains a polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) that inﬂuences availability of serotonin transporters thereby inﬂuencing 5-HT
eﬃcacy.  Carrying an S-allele of this gene (opposed to an L-allele) causes
increased hormonal and behavioral stress responsiveness (Gotlib,
Joormann, Minor, & Hallmayer, 2008; Markus & De Raedt, 2011;
Markus & Firk, 2009; Mueller, Brocke, Fries, Lesch, & Kirschbaum,
2010), greater brain responses to fearful stimuli (Hariri & Holmes,
2006; Murphy Name, 2013) and increased chances of aﬀective disorders
in response to stressful life events (Karg, Burmeister, Shedden, & Sen,
2011; Miller, Wankerl, Stalder, Kirschbaum, & Alexander, 2013).  There
is indirect support for this gene’s inﬂuence on emotional eating as an Sallele is associated with overweight and obesity (Erritzoe Name, 2010;
Sookoian Name, 2007) and also seems to mediate the eﬀect of stressful
events on the incidence of eating disorders (Di Bella, Catalano,
Cavallini, Riboldi, & Bellodi, 2000; Fumeron Name, 2001).  However

direct associations between this allele and bodyweight are not always
reproduced (Hinney Name, 1997; Racine, Culbert, Larson, & Klump,
2009; Sundaramurthy, Pieri, Gape, Markham, & Campbell, 2000), suggesting that its role in emotional eating is more contributing than deterministic.  Ancillary to brain 5-HT function, stress vulnerability also
depends on cognitive evaluation of
stressful events
(Folkman & Lazarus, 1988).  A possible important interacting cognitive
factor in 5-HTTLPR’s eﬀect on emotional eating is neuroticism.  Neuroticism is a personality trait that inﬂuences the frequency and intensity(Kendler, Kuhn, & Prescott, 2004;
Luteijn & Bouman, 1988).  This cognitive stress vulnerability seems to
play a role in the eﬀect of 5-HTTLPR on eating behavior while particularly S/S-carriers who score high on neuroticism show an increased
body mass index (BMI) (Markus & Capello, 2012).  However a 5-HTTLPR by neuroticism interaction on food intake could not be found in
response to a natural (Capello & Markus, 2014a) or experimental
(Capello & Markus, 2014b) stressor.  These data suggest that neuroticism
does not directly inﬂuence the eﬀect of 5-HTTLPR on eating behavior,
however it might play a role through promoting a ruminative thinking
style (Lam, Smith, Checkley, Rijsdijk, & Sham, 2003; Watkins, 2008). 
Ruminative thinking is often deﬁned as (uncontrollable) perseverative
thinking about past or present negative events (Nolen-Hoeksema,
Wisco, & Lyubomirsky, 2008), even prolonging the biological stress
response as the body remains in a state of elevated levels of stress
hormones
stressor has disappeared
(Zoccola & Dickerson, 2012).  Consequently rumination is an important
factor in depression (Rood, Roelofs, B & gels, & Alloy, 2010) and eating
disorders (Birmingham & Firoz, 2006), is a solid predictor for negative
aﬀect in healthy subjects (Roelofs, Huibers, Peeters, Arntz, & van Os,
2008) and is even found to mediate the eﬀect of daily stress on food
intake among obese adults (Kubiak, V & gele, Siering, Schiel, & Weber,
2008).  Recent insights propose that a speciﬁc combination of high ruminative thinking and carrying an S-allele of 5-HTTLPR might increase
rewarding eﬀects of high caloric palatable foods and hence, the risk of
emotional eating (Schepers & Markus, 2015).  The aim of the current
study was to test whether this proposed increased risk of emotional
eating among high ruminative S-carriers is reﬂected in an increased
attention bias for high palatable foods during stress. 
(cortisol)longEmotional eating usually is accompanied by a preference for high
caloric sweet and/or fat foods (for a review see: Schepers & Markus,
2015), consumption of speciﬁcally these food types are associated with
activation of reward areas in the brain (Berridge, 1996; Small, JonesGotman, & Dagher, 2003).  Interestingly, seeing stimuli that are associated with reward when consumed can also already activate the brain
reward areas, thereby drawing attention towards these stimuli and
possibly induce craving (Carter & Tiﬀany, 1999).  These so called ‘attentional biases’ have been found for multiple types of drugs, for instance: caﬀeine (Yeomans, Javaherian, Tovey, & Staﬀord, 2005), tobacco(Townshend & Duka, 2001) and opiates
(Lubman, Peters, Mogg,
Bradley, & Deakin, 2000), but also for food cues, for instance particularly obese individuals show heightened vigilance for food related visual cues (Castellanos Name, 2009; Werthmann Name, 2011) and healthy
women were found to show an increased attention for food cues and
appetite after negative mood (Hepworth, Mogg, Brignell, & Bradley,Hudson, & Mogg,
(Bradley,2007),
Based on these ﬁndings our aim was to examine the combined inﬂuence of 5-HTTLPR genotype and ruminative thinking on visual attention for food cues during acute stress.  From a large genotype database (N = 827), 97 homozygous S’-and L’-allele carriers with either
high or low scores on a ruminative thinking scale were recruited and
tested for visual attention for food cues using an eye-tracking paradigm
before and after an acute laboratory stressor.
