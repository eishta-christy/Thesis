Despite on-going research, the progress in knowledge of pathogenesis and pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, remains unsatisfactory.  This emphasizes the need for animal
models to study the pathophysiology and treatment targets to overcome
the great heterogeneity of this disease due to its multifactorial background [1].  While there are a number of animal models, from rodents
[2–5] to ﬁsh [6], mimicking characteristic features of the pathology,
the validity of such models − particularly in light of the negative effects on the animals − is under controversial debate [7,8]. 
Since both perspectives need to be considered, the scientiﬁc and the
ethical, one needs to ﬁnd a good compromise to fulﬁll both criteria. 
Of course it is not possible to develop animal models mimicking the
human situation 1:1, but there are emotional, homeostatic and psychomotoric core symptoms of human depression that may be assessed
objectively in rodent models [9].  One approach could be an increased
awareness with regard to the optimal constellation of paradigms and
model organisms [10].  As a prerequisite, in mice this requires an adequate consideration of background strains, which may fundamentally
diﬀer with regard to a solid basis for the respective mutation [11–17]. 
Many in vivo studies involving genetic manipulations in mice are
conducted on a C57BL/6 background, which was recently described as
“gold standard” [18,19].  On the other hand, to model the human
condition in a more translational way it would be advisable not to use
inbred animals, but to work with mixed genetic backgrounds [20],
which resemble the heterogeneity of patients more closely.  This is
supported by a study by Ridder Name who was able to demonstrate a
helpless behavioral phenotype in GR+/− mice on a mixed C57BL/6N x
FVB/N background, not under basal, but stressed conditions [20]. 
Contrary, mice overexpressing the GR (on the mixed background as
well) showed the opposite phenotype when analyzed for respective

parameters [20,21], which emphasizes the impact of an appropriate
selection of background strains to increase the validity of in vivo studies. 
GR represents a target gene for depression and several publications
indicate its signiﬁcance in regulating the negative feedback in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system after stress-induced increase of corticosterone [22]. 
Since depression in humans and animals represents a multi-factorial
disease, that implies the interaction between a distinct genetic predisposition in the presence of a challenging environment [23,24], the
approach by Ridder Name was considered a suitable model with good
face- and construct validity.  In addition, stress physiological data and
the responsiveness of the model to DEX/CRH challenge underlined its
impact with regard to predictive validity [20,25]. 
What remains, however, a challenging aspect is the general validity
of diﬀerent animal models for depression and anxiety [26].  Considering
construct validity, i. e.  etiology of a disease, the learned helplessness
(LH) paradigm may be a workable compromise due to a rather artiﬁcial
− instead of straight translational − way to induce the depressive-like
state by uncontrollable and unpredictable foot shocks [27].  From this
point of view, the model of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)
may be better suited, but also bears some challenges [28,29]. 
The aim of our study here was to examine the transferability of a
heterozygous mutation of the GR to two commonly used background
strains, which naturally diﬀer in their basal characteristics [11].  Furthermore, it was our intention to compare two diﬀerent stress models to
be able to make a more valid, generalized statement about the role of
GR in depression. 
To follow up our hypothesis that, with our models, genetic traits can
evoke a stable depressive-like phenotype − reliable even on multiple
background strains, we investigated GR+/− animals on a C57BL/6N
and BALB/c background.  Assuming that a well-described stressor is a
decisive factor, the mice were divided in two cohorts, exposed to either
four weeks of UCMS or LH respectively, and were then analyzed in
standardized behavioral tests for emotional and depressive-like behaviors.

2. 1.  Animals and housing conditions
All experiments were conducted with male mice (12–15 weeks old
at the onset of the experiments) being either heterozygous for the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR+/−) or littermate controls
[30].  The founders of GR-heterozygous mice (GR+/−) were developed
by using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells as described earlier [30].  All mice were genotyped after weaning to check for
heterozygosity of the GR alleles (Primer sequences from 5′ to 3′: GR1:
GGC ATG CAC ATT ACG GCC TTC T; GR4: GTG TAG CAG CCA GCT
TAC AGG A GR8: CCT TCT CAT TCC ATG TCA GCA TGT).  Real-time
RT-PCR and Western Blot analyses by Ridder Name [20] revealed a
signiﬁcant down regulation of GR protein as well as mRNA level in GR
heterozygous mice.  Mice were bred either for a minimum of 10 generations on a C57BL/6N (N = 95) or on a BALB/c (N = 75) background strain in the animal facility of the Central Institute of Mental
Health (CIMH, Mannheim, Germany).  Mice were weaned at the age of 4
weeks, and were then housed in type III Macrolon® cages equipped with
nesting material, food and water ad libitum in littermate groups. 
At an age of 8 weeks, the litter groups were divided in two independent cohorts being either transported to the University François
Rabelais (Tours, France) for the unpredictable chronic mild stress
(UCMS) paradigm and the following behavioral experiments (see
Fig.  1A for details) or transferred from the CIMH breeding to housing
facility for the basic behavioral experiments and the subsequent learned
helplessness (LH) paradigm (see Fig.  1B for details). 
For the UCMS, the animals were randomly separated into speciﬁc
housing conditions as follows: unstressed control mice (C57BL/6N
GR+/+ N = 15, GR+/− N = 14, BALB/c GR+/+ N = 9, GR+/−
N = 10) were group housed up to a maximum of four littermates per
cage in type III Macrolon® cages equipped with red transparent igloos
and PVC plastic tunnels.  Mice exposed to the UCMS paradigm (C57BL/
6N GR+/+ N = 15, GR+/− N = 15, BALB/c GR+/+ N = 10, GR+/−
N = 10) were maintained single housed in disposable cages with a ﬂoor
area of 187 cm2 (Charles River) with standard bedding only (isolation
stress).  Stress group and control group were maintained in separated
rooms to avoid confounding eﬀects of the stress procedures in the
control group. 
In the LH paradigm group, mice were single housed with standard
bedding and nesting material (paper tissue) in type II Macrolon® cages,
arriving in the experimental unit 2 weeks prior to the onset of the behavioral experiments (C57BL/6N GR+/+ N = 15, GR+/− N = 14,
BALB/c GR+/+ N = 9, GR+/− N = 10). 
All behavioral procedures were conducted during the dark, e. g.  the
animals’ active phase with lights oﬀ at 9 am to 9 pm (UCMS paradigm)
or 7 am to 7 pm (LH paradigm).  Water and food pellets were available
ad libitum.  Bodyweight was assessed weekly when the cages were
changed.  All experiments were conducted blind to the genotype, which
was analyzed after the animals had undergone all behavioral tests.  All
animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines
of the European Commission (EC) Council Directive (2010/63/EU)
(Germany: Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, France: Comité Régional
d’Ethique en Expérimentation Animale (CREEA Centre Limousin)).  All
eﬀorts were made to minimize animal suﬀering and to reduce the
number of animals used. 
2. 2.  Unpredictable chronic mild stress procedure (UCMS) and behavioral
consequences
2. 2. 1.  UCMS
Mice were repeatedly subjected to various socio-environmental
stressors according to a balanced schedule for a total period of 4 weeks
as described previously (Fig 1A) [28].  The protocol applied involved
randomized, daily exposures to distinct stressors including: damp
bedding, removal of bedding, substitution of sawdust with 21 °C water
(shallow water bath), cage exchange (mice were placed in the empty
cage of another male); sawdust change, cage tilting (45°), predator
smell (rat feces) and predator bird sounds as well as an altered length
and time of the light/dark cycles, and restraint stress (1 h).  Mice were
subjected 3–4 h per day to these mild stressors.
