The human startle response is a reﬂexive contraction of the skeletal
and facial muscles in response to a sudden, intense stimulus and is regarded as a defensive rather than an orienting response (Braﬀ, 2010). 
The strength of the human eye blink reﬂex is assessed as a subcomponent of the whole body startle reﬂex using electromyography
(EMG) of the orbicularis oculi muscles.  PPI of the startle reﬂex is the
phenomenon that the startle magnitude as a result of a startle-eliciting
stimulus (or “pulse”, e. g.  a sound of approximately 118 dB) is decreased
whenever a less intense and non-startling stimulus (or “prepulse”, e. g.  a
sound of approximately 85 dB) is presented just before the intense stimulus.  PPI can, among others, be modulated by the interval that separates the prepulse and pulse stimuli, with the maximum inhibition
usually occurring between 100 and 120 ms (Graham & Murray, 1977;
Stitt, Hoﬀman, & DeVido, 1980).  Hence, it is regarded a useful tool to
investigate information processing, more speciﬁcally, a measure of
sensorimotor gating because the eye-blink reﬂex is based on a muscle
contraction (Braﬀ & Geyer, 1990; Braﬀ, 1993). 
For schizophrenia patients, there is ample evidence that PPI is reduced compared to healthy individuals when using unimodal paradigms (Braﬀ Name, 1978; Graham, 1975; see Braﬀ, Geyer, & Swerdlow,
2001; Braﬀ, 2010; Takahashi Name, 2011 for reviews). 
Previous studies have shown that PPI also occurs with other than
acoustic stimuli, particularly stimuli from the tactile and nociceptive
modality have been studied, both in healthy control
subjects
(Blumenthal, Burnett, & Swerdlow, 2001; Kumari, Antonova, & Geyer,
2008) and schizophrenia patients (Bolino Name, 1994; Kumari Name,
2003) by using either electrical stimulation or airpuﬀs.  There is also
evidence that PPI can be induced by using cross-modal paradigms in
healthy individuals from studies using acoustic prepulses and tactile
pulses (Hoﬀman, Cohen, & Stitt, 1981; Flaten, Firan, & Blumenthal,
2016; Sanes & Ison, 1979; Stitt Name, 1980), studies using tactile pre1987;(Blumenthal & Gescheider,and

Blumenthal & Tolomeo, 1989; Elden & Flaten, 2003; Hill & Blumenthal,
2005; Perlstein, Simons, & Graham, 2001) and studies using visual
prepulses and electrocutaneous (Rossi Name, 1995) or acoustic (Oranje,
Geyer, Bocker, Kenemans, & Verbaten, 2006) pulses.  Typically, the efﬁciency of those cross-modal pairings in eliciting PPI was lower compared to unimodal conditions.  Yet, up to now there is only one crossmodal study in schizophrenia patients: Braﬀ, Grillon, and Geyer (1992)
reported reduced PPI in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy
controls with acoustic prepulses and either tactile (airpuﬀs) or acoustic
pulse stimuli. 
For stimulus processing, it is known that processing times diﬀer
between sensory modalities: For example, it is known that the overall
processing time of acoustic stimuli is shorter than that of visual stimuli. 
This is due to faster transduction times in the ear and a shorter distance
from the ear to the auditory cortex (King, 2005).  Processing times of
electrocutaneous,
i. e.  nociceptive, stimuli are also longer than of
acoustic stimuli (Flaten Name, 2016). 
In the current study we investigated the stimulation eﬃciency of an
electrocutaneous prepulse combined with an acoustic startle-eliciting
pulse in healthy controls as well as in patients with schizophrenia.  We
expected to ﬁnd signiﬁcantly lower PPI in patients compared to controls
as this was found with both unimodal and cross-modal paradigms before (see Braﬀ Name, 2001 for a review).  We also reasoned that a crossmodal pairing of stimuli should result in a lower PPI for both patients
and controls as electrocutaneous prepulses have proven to be less effective in evoking PPI compared to acoustic ones in unimodal paradigms (Flaten Name, 2016). 
This study was part of a larger project investigating somatosensory
(electrocutaneous stimuli) P50 suppression in healthy individuals (Bak,
Glenthøj, Rostrup, Larsson, & Oranje, 2011) and schizophrenia patients
(Bak, Rostrup, Larsson, Glenthøj, & Oranje, 2014).

2. 1.  Subjects
The study was approved by the Committee for Biomedical Research
Ethics, Copenhagen, taking into account the ethical principles stated in
the Declaration of Helsinki (Amendment of Washington, 2002).  After
written and oral information had been given, written informed consent
was obtained from all subjects before enrolment in the study.  To reduce
variance we included only male participants as it is described that
women have lower levels of PPI than males in both healthy people
(Swerdlow Name, 1993) and schizophrenia patients
(Kumari,
Aasen, & Sharma, 2004).  Additionally, women’s PPI levels are aﬀected
by the menstrual cycle (Swerdlow, Hartman, & Auerbach, 1997). 
Twenty-four healthy male volunteers (mean age: 25. 67, SD = 4. 90)
were recruited through an advertisement on the internet, all from the
Copenhagen area.  Absence of any psychiatric disorder as well as alcohol
or drug abuse was ensured by the use of Schedule for Clinical
Assessment in Neuropsychiatry, version 2. 1 (SCAN, Wing Name, 1990). 
Moreover, the healthy volunteers did not have a ﬁrst-degree relative
with a DSM-IV diagnosis and none of them had ever received psychopharmacological medication, nor had they participated in any electrophysiological experiment before. 
Twenty-three schizophrenia patients (mean age: 35. 91, SD = 9. 49)
were recruited either by advertisement in the community mental health
centre, or were referred to us by their practitioner.  Psychopathology
was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS;
Kay, Fiszbein, & Opler, 1987), and the diagnosis was conﬁrmed with the
SCAN.  Fulﬁlled DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence was an exclusion criterion.  Seventeen patients received antipsychotic treatment
at the time of participation: one with ﬁrst-generation antipsychotics,
three with clozapine, eleven with other second-generation antipsychotics, and two with a combination of ﬁrst- and second-generation
antipsychotics.  Six patients were free of any medication, deﬁned as
having received no antipsychotics in the last three months preceding
study participation.  Twelve patients and ﬁve healthy controls were
smokers ranging from 5 to 25 cigarettes a day.  PANSS scores of one
patient were missing.  Thus, PANSS scores of 22 patients are reported. 
Details regarding healthy control participants and both patient
groups are summarized in Table 1. 
2. 2.  Experimental design and tasksopiates,cocaine,
cannabis,
Prior to the test session a urine sample of all participants was
screened
amphetamines
(Syva®RapidTest d. a. u®4).  In order to minimize potential eﬀects of
caﬀeine and/or nicotine, all subjects were asked to refrain from
drinking beverages that contained caﬀeine prior to the assessments on a
test day, and from smoking an hour before meeting at the laboratory. 
Subjects were seated comfortably in a sound insulated room
(40 dB), situated adjacent to the control room.  They were instructed to
sit still and stay awake.  The paradigm was presented via Presentation®
software (Neurobehavioral Systems®, Albany, CA, USA; soundcard:
Creative soundblaster®5. 1, 2008 Creative Technology Ltd, Singapore). 
The electrocutaneous stimuli were presented by an electrical stimulator
(Digitimer®, model DS7A, Hertfordshire, UK).  Acoustic stimuli were
presented binaurally through stereo insert earphones (Eartone® ABR,
1996–2008 Interacoustics A/S, Denmark, C and H Distributors Inc. ,In our bimodal PPI paradigm we used a short (5 ms) weak electrocutaneous stimulus applied over the median nerve of the left forearm as
prepulse.  The intensity was set at 80% of the electric current that was
needed to activate the subject’s thenar reﬂex.  As such, the electric stimulation could be felt but was not painful according to participants’
reports.  The intensities ranged from 2 to 8. 4 mA, with a mean of 4. 9 mA
(SD = 1. 6) for both patients and healthy controls.  The startle-eliciting
stimulus consisted of a sound (white noise) with an intensity of 118 dB
and a duration of 20 ms, instant rise and fall. 
The assessment of PPI started with three minutes of acclimation to a
background noise (70 dB white noise), which was presented continuously during the paradigm.  The actual experiment consisted of one
block with 24 pseudo-randomized (not more than two trials of the sameK.  Haß Name

type succeeding each other) trials, superimposed on the background
noise: 12 pulse alone trials (pa, trials in which the startle-eliciting stimulus was presented alone) and 12 prepulse-pulse trials (pp, trials in
which the electrocutaneous prepulse preceded the startle-eliciting stimulus).  The intertrial intervals (ITI) were randomized between 10 and
20 s.  The interval between the prepulse and pulse (stimulus onset
asynchrony, SOA) was ﬁxed to 120 ms.  The assessment took approximately 11 min. 
2. 3.  Signal recording
The eye-blink component, i. e.  electromyographic (EMG) activity, of
the startle response was recorded from the right m. orbicularis oculi:
Two electrodes were placed under the right eye for startle response
measurement.  The ﬁrst of these was aligned with the pupil, the other
positioned just laterally.  EMG recordings were assessed with BioSemi®
hardware (Biosemi, Amsterdam, the Netherlands).  Sampling started
immediately before the experimental block was started and lasted until
the end of it (continuous recording).  All EMG signals were digitized
online by a computer, at a rate of 4096 Hz. 
2. 4.  EMG data processing
Following oﬄine ﬁltering of the data between 25 and 250 Hz,
startle amplitude was scored as the highest absolute amplitude in microvolt within the time interval 20–100 ms after the startle-eliciting
pulse.  A computerized algorithm was used for peak detection.
