The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been shown to play a pivotal
role in the neural circuitry of stress and mediates the eﬀects of stress on
memory related processes [1,2].  This region has a critical role in fear,
anxiety and activation of
the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis
which results in the release of glucocorticoid hormones (main hormones involved in stress) [3,4].  It was established that chronic stress
elicits structural changes such as increased dendritic branching and
increased number of spines in BLA projection neurons [5,6].  Besides,
previous evidence revealed that glucocorticoids enhance the excitability of principal BLA cells [7] and systemic injections of glucocorticoids enhance baseline responses in BLA in a dose-dependent manner
[2].  Moreover, Rosenkranz Name clariﬁed that chronic stress increased
excitability of BLA projection neurons recorded in vivo [8] and Cui
Name suggested that exposure to a single prolonged stress paradigm
followed by a 7 days recovery period identiﬁed increases in total dendritic length and branch points of BLA pyramidal neurons [1]. 
On the other hand, there are numerous studies indicating that the
BLA mediates stimulus-reward learning that is required for a conditioned stimulus to gain incentive motivational and conditioned reinforcing value [9].
