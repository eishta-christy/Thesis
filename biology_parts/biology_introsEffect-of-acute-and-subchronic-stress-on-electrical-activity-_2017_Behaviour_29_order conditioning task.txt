The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been shown to play a pivotal
role in the neural circuitry of stress and mediates the eﬀects of stress on
memory related processes [1,2].  This region has a critical role in fear,
anxiety and activation of
the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis
which results in the release of glucocorticoid hormones (main hormones involved in stress) [3,4].  It was established that chronic stress
elicits structural changes such as increased dendritic branching and
increased number of spines in BLA projection neurons [5,6].  Besides,
previous evidence revealed that glucocorticoids enhance the excitability of principal BLA cells [7] and systemic injections of glucocorticoids enhance baseline responses in BLA in a dose-dependent manner
[2].  Moreover, Rosenkranz Name clariﬁed that chronic stress increased
excitability of BLA projection neurons recorded in vivo [8] and Cui
Name suggested that exposure to a single prolonged stress paradigm
followed by a 7 days recovery period identiﬁed increases in total dendritic length and branch points of BLA pyramidal neurons [1]. 
On the other hand, there are numerous studies indicating that the
BLA mediates stimulus-reward learning that is required for a conditioned stimulus to gain incentive motivational and conditioned reinforcing value [9].  Electrophysiological studies have revealed that BLA
neurons are responsive to reward-predictive cues [10].  Inactivation or
lesions of the BLA impairs acquisition of cocaine-seeking behavior and
conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats, demonstrating a critical role
for the BLA during opiate-related learning and memory [9,11].  In addition, the BLA has a critical role in drug-seeking, relapse and also the
extinction of approach behavior to drug-associated cues [9,12].  A
substantial literature indicates that the role of amygdala in processing
rewarding aspects of stimuli may occur via functional relations between
the BLA and the mesoaccumbens dopamine system [12].  In the other
words, mesolimbic dopamine pathway from the ventral tegmental area
to the nucleus accumbens mediates the rewarding eﬀects of opiates and
the BLA is connected anatomically with this pathway [13,14].  The
ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and BLA form a functionally interconnected network that is critical for processing the primary

rewarding eﬀects of opiates as well as opiate-related memory [11]. 
Indeed, the functional connectivity of the BLA-nucleus accumbens
pathway is necessary for animals to respond on a second order conditioning task with a natural or drug reinforce [10].  Therefore, in this
study, we tried to determine the eﬀects of morphine-CPP or stress alone
to alternate ﬁring rate of BLA neurons.
