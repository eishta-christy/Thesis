Attention constitutes a constellation of cognitive processes responsible for directing awareness to relevant stimuli and ﬁltering out
irrelevant information.  Attentional impairments are known to constitute performance reductions in other cognitive domains including
memory and executive functions in patients suﬀering from Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) [1,2].  The basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic system, consisting of cortically-projecting neurons in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nBM) and substantia innominata (SI) region, mediates essential aspects of attentional
information processing [3,4], and
cholinergic dysregulation is a common feature of the mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and AD pathology [5–8].  Thus, it is suggested that
disruption in cholinergic signaling may underlie cognitive decline in
MCI/AD.  Aging is a well-known risk factor for AD.  Although a gradual
weakening of the cholinergic system and subtle decrements in attentional capacities have been reported in aging [9–13], the mechanisms
responsible for the accelerated decline in cholinergic function in
sporadic AD are not fully understood. 
BF cholinergic neurons depend upon nerve growth factor (NGF) for
survival, growth, and maturation [14–16].  Substantial evidence indicates that the cholinotrophic eﬀects of NGF are mediated by its
binding to the high-aﬃnity tropomyosin kinase A (trkA) receptors
[17–19].  Moreover, the loss of trkA receptors has been observed in the
postmortem brains of AD subjects [20–22].  Together, these studies
support the notion that perhaps deﬁcient trkA signaling in cholinergic
neurons may underlie their exceptional vulnerability and lead to cognitive decline in AD [23,24].  However, neurotrophic modulation of the
cholinergic system and cognitive capacities has not been thoroughly
investigated in the context of aging, which is known to potentially increase the risk of developing AD [25]. 
We previously found signiﬁcant attentional impairments and disrupted cholinergic signaling in aged but not adult trkA-suppressed rats
[26].  In another follow-up study, we observed that cholinergic-attentional capacities were partially rescued by blocking proNGF, a precursor of NGF, in trkA-suppressed aged rats [27].  ProNGF is known to

induce apoptotic signaling via its interaction with high-aﬃnity p75
receptors and the sortilin complex [28], and numerous studies indicated that the expression of this pro-neurotrophin is elevated in aging
and AD [29–32].  Thus, age-related imbalance between proNGF/NGF
and trkA/p75 signaling may account for increased vulnerability of the
cholinergic system and associated cognitive impairments in AD. 
Moreover, suppression of trkA signaling per se in young may not impose
any inimical eﬀects on the BF cholinergic system.  This view is supported by a previous study showing that forebrain-speciﬁc targeted
deletion of NGF or trkA receptors exerted detrimental eﬀects on BF
cholinergic neurons during postnatal development but did not impact
learning and memory performance when assessed in either young adult
or intermediate-aged mice [33]. 
During the progression of sporadic AD, cortical areas are aﬀected in
a stereotypic sequence that recapitulates ontogenetic brain development [34].  Although the available evidence supports the idea that
perhaps reduced trophic support during ontogenetic development and
maturation of the cortical cholinergic input system may escalate into
MCI and AD [35,36], the premise that developmental abrogation of BF
trkA signaling would accelerate age-related decline in the cholinergic
system and cognitive capacities has never been tested.  Here we conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate the life-long impact of developmental trkA suppression on attentional functions.  We utilized an
adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector that expresses trkA-shRNA to selectively knockdown trkA receptors in the BF during the postnatal
phase in rats when cholinergic projections make contact with cortical
target regions.  The animals were trained in an operant sustained attention task (SAT), and performance was assessed throughout adulthood until old age, at which point cholinergic signaling and morphology were also evaluated.  Developmental trkA suppression neither
accelerated the emergence, nor exacerbated the presence, of age-related
attentional impairments.  Moreover, postnatal trkA disruption aﬀected
only certain aspects of cholinergic transmission in aged rats.  Together,
our ﬁndings indicate that lifelong cognitive engagement may have
compensated for the detrimental eﬀects of developmental trkA knockdown on age-related decline in attention processes and the cholinergic
transmission that these cognitive capacities depend on.

2. 1.  Subjects
Male Wistar rat pups [post-natal day (PND) 14] were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories (Malvern, PA, USA) along with the
nursing dams (8 pups/dam).  Animals were maintained in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with a 12:12 light-dark cycle
starting at 7AM at Temple University.  At PND 18–21, rat pups underwent stereotaxic intracranial infusions of AAV vectors (see procedure
below).  Pups were returned to cages and maintained with the dams
until weaning at PND 22 following which the animals were grouphoused (2 per cage) with food and water ad libitum until the commencement of further experiments.  All experimental procedures were
conducted in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and the Institutional Biosafety Committee at Temple
University. 
2. 2.  Stereotaxic surgeries and experimental design
Rat pups (PND 18–21) were prepared for stereotaxic surgeries to
produce knockdown of BF trkA receptors using an AAV vector-based
RNA interference (RNAi) approach.  This developmental period was
selected because BF cholinergic neurons make contact with NGF-producing target neurons throughout the cortical mantle during postnatal
weeks 3–5, and trkA signaling is critical in facilitating proper cortical
cholinergic innervation [37,18,38,39].  All surgeries were performed
under aseptic conditions.  Pups were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (4–5%
for induction and 1–2% maintenance dose) using an anesthesia machine (Surgivet, Dublin, OH, USA) and mounted on a stereotaxic frame
(Model 962; David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA).  The head of
the pups was positioned into the head frame using neonatal rat ear bars
containing Zygoma ear cups (David Kopf).  An isothermal deltaphase
pad (Braintree Scientiﬁc, Braintree, MA, USA) was used to consistently
maintain animals’ body temperature at 37 °C throughout the surgical
procedure.  A recombinant AAV vector previously designed and validated in our laboratory for in vivo suppression of trkA receptors (AAVtrkA) was used in the present study [26,40].  This vector utilizes a
synthetic inhibitory B-cell receptor inducible gene BIC-derived RNA
(SIBR) expression plasmid to guide the expression of both the small
hairpin RNA (shRNA) against the trkA gene and the reporter gene
(green ﬂuorescent protein; GFP).  Another AAV vector expressing
shRNA targeting the gene for ﬁreﬂy luciferase (AAV-luc) served as
control for non-speciﬁc virus eﬀects.  Prior to the surgeries, AAV vectors
were desalted using the Hyclone buﬀer (University of Iowa Vector
Core).  Rat pups received bilateral infusions of either AAV-trkA or AAVluc (1. 5 μL/hemisphere; titer: 0. 7-2. 8 × 1013 vg/mL) into the BF, speciﬁcally targeting the nBM/SI region that contain cholinergic neurons
(from Bregma; A/P: −1. 0; M/L: ± 2. 3; D/V: −6. 0).  All injections
were made using a 10 μL Hamilton syringe (28 gauge) at a rate of 1 μL/
min.  After cessation of the injection, the needle was left in place for an
additional 4 min to allow complete diﬀusion of virus particles and then
slowly withdrawn.  The incision site was stapled and triple antibiotic
ointment was applied to the area surrounding the staples.  Rat pups
were given injections of an antibiotic (Baytril, 0. 01 mg/kg, s. c. ) and an
analgesic (buprenorphine, 0. 01 mg/kg, s. c. ) prior to returning to the
nursing dam.

either trkA (AAV-trkA) or the control gene luciferase (AAV-luc) into the BF.  To evaluate the impact of developmental trkA suppression on attentional capacity throughout aging, rats
initiated behavioral training in operant SAT at 6 months and were maintained on the task until 24 months old.  Age-related changes in attentional function were assessed speciﬁcally from
12 to 24 months old.  After completion of the behavioral testing, electrochemical recordings of cortical cholinergic transmission were conducted in anesthetized rats following which the
brain tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry. B.  Yegla, V.  Parikh

attentional capacities in aging rats, the animals (N = 8/vector manipulation) were single-housed at 6 months of age and the operant behavioral training was initiated (see task details below).  Rats used for behavioral studies were handled extensively prior to training and were
partially water-deprived by restricting access to a 10-min period in the
home cage following each behavioral session.  On non-training days,
water access was increased to a 30-min period.  Food was available adlibitum throughout the duration of behavioral testing.  Animals remained
on task until 24 months old and the eﬀects of vector manipulation and
age on behavioral performance were assessed on a monthly basis
starting from month 12 until the completion of the study.  At 24 months,
animals underwent amperometric recording sessions to evaluate theimmunohistochemical examination of trkA and choline acetyltransferase
(ChAT, a marker of cholinergic neurons) expression.  A subset of animals
(N = 4-5/vector manipulation) was perfused at 6 weeks of age to assess
the eﬃciency of the viral vector for developmental trkA suppression
(see immunohistochemistry procedure below).

followed2. 3.  Operant training and testing procedures
Behavioral training and testing was conducted in modular operant
conditioning chambers made of clear polycarbonate and mounted on a
white polypropylene base (Med Associates Inc. , St.  Albans, VT, USA). 
Each chamber contained a front stainless steel panel with three lights
(2. 8 W each), two retractable levers, and a liquid receptacle attached to
a water dispenser in the center of the panel.  The back panel of each
chamber contained a house light and the ﬂoor was composed of a
stainless steel grid bar.  Operant chambers were enclosed in sound-attenuating cubicles equipped with fans to dampen surrounding noise
(Fig.  2A).  All events including signal delivery, lever presentations, and
reward delivery were transmitted using programs written in Medstate
notation via SmrtCtrl™ interface on a Dell Optiplex 960 computer. 
Rats were trained in an operant SAT that encapsulates all elements
of signal detection theory to assess attentional capacities [41,10,42]. 
Animals were initially autoshaped on a FR-1 schedule of reinforcement
for water reward (0. 02 mL water) to attain the lever press response. 
During this phase, if the animals pressed the same lever > 5 times in
succession, the lever ceased to be reinforced until the discrepancy between the two levers was reduced.  This step was adopted to deter the
development of a side bias.  Once the rats made 120 lever presses within
a single autoshaping session, they progressed to the next phase of
training to learn paradigm contingencies.  At this stage, the animals
were trained to distinguish between signal (illumination of the central
panel light for 1 s) and non-signal (no illumination) trials.  Rats were
pseudo-randomly designated to a lever side under signal trial conditions and had to respond on the opposite lever for non-signal trials.  For
example, if a rat was designated to the left lever, on a signal trial, a left
lever press was rewarded (i. e. , hit) but not a right lever press (i. e. ,
miss).  In contrast, a right lever press on a non-signal trial was rewarded
(i. e. , correct rejection) but left lever press (i. e. , false alarm) was not
rewarded (see Fig.  2B for task illustration).  Levers were presented 2 s
after a 1s-long signal illumination.  If rats did not lever press within 4 s
the levers were retracted, and it was deemed an omission.  The assignment of lever (left or right) for each trial type was counterbalanced
across animals within a group.  The inter-trial
interval (ITI) was
12 ± 3s.  During this training phase, an incorrect response elicited
correction trials in which the same trial type was repeated up to 4 sequential times to assist with learning the task contingencies.  If the incorrect behavior persisted a forced trial was provided, in which only the
correct lever was presented.  Rats progressed to the ﬁnal training stage
when they performed 160 trials with ≥70% on hits and correct rejections and ≤20% omissions for three consecutive days. 
The ﬁnal stage of SAT consisted of a pseudo-randomized sequence
of 81 signal (27 per signal duration) and 81 non-signal trials (total 162
trials).  Each session was divided into three blocks of 54 trials (27 signal
trials and 27 non-signal trials).  Signals occurred unpredictably at three
durations (500, 50, and 25 ms; Fig.  2B), with 9 trials/signal duration in
each block.  Moreover, the ITI was reduced to 9 ± 3s, and the house
light remained illuminated throughout the session.  These task conditions are known to constrain rats’ behavior for continuous monitoring
of the central panel and tax attentional capacity [41].  Rats were characterized as acquiring the task once they achieved ≥70% on 500 ms
signal duration trials, ≥70% on correct rejections, and ≤10% omissions for three consecutive training sessions.  To further assess the impact of aging and developmental trkA knockdown on top-down attentional capacity, rats were tested in a distractor version of SAT (dSAT) at
12 and 24 months of age, respectively.  dSAT involved the presentation
of a visual distractor (ﬂashing house light at 0. 5 Hz) in the second block
of the session. 
Behavioral performance for each session was evaluated by calculating the proportion of hits (h = hits/hits + misses) for each signal
length and the proportion of false alarms (fa = false alarms/false
alarms + correct rejections).  A composite measure of attention was
calculated as a performance score (SAT/dSAT) using the formula, (hfa)/[2(h + fa)-(h + fa)2], as described earlier [43].  SAT/dSAT scores

of the sustained attention task (SAT).  Rats discriminated between signal (illumination of the central panel light) and non-signal (no illumination) trials by exhibiting an appropriate lever
press response (either left or right).  Animals were pseudo-randomly designated to a lever side for each trial condition.  For a left lever assignment on a signal trial, a left lever press was
scored as a hit (h) and rewarded but a right lever press was scored as a miss (m) and was not rewarded.  In contrast, a right lever press on a non-signal trial was scored as a correct rejection
(cr) and rewarded but not a left lever press which was considered a false alarm (fa).  The assignment of lever (left or right) for each trial type was counterbalanced across animals within a
group.  At the ﬁnal stage of SAT training, each session consisted of a pseudo-randomized sequence of 81 signal and 81 non-signal trials with an inter-trial interval of 9 ± 3s.  Signals
occurred unpredictably at three durations (500, 50, and 25 ms) and the house light remained illuminated throughout the session. B.  Yegla, V.  Parikh

ranged from −1 to +1; a score of +1 indicated correct responses on all
signal and non-signal trials, 0 indicated inability to discern signal and
non-signal trials, and −1 indicated all misses and false alarms in a
session.  Latency for the lever press response under each performance
condition and percentage omissions were also calculated for each session.  Performance measures on three consecutive sessions were averaged for each rat at a given age and used for statistical analysis. 
2. 4.  In vivo amperometric recordings
Following the completion of behavioral studies at 24 months of age,
rats were prepared for amperometric recordings of cholinergic transmission using enzyme-selective microelectrodes as described earlier
[26,44,45].  Brieﬂy, microelectrode arrays (Quanteon, Nicholasville,
KY, USA) consisting of four rectangular platinum recording sites arranged side by side in pairs were coated with choline oxidase (SigmaAldrich, St.  Louis, MO, USA).
