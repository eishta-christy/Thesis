: The present study explores whether long-lasting pleasant touch has positive eﬀects on the stress
response, reward sensitivity, mood, and interoceptive awareness. 
Methods: 40 participants received either 35 min of brush stroking targeting C-tactile ﬁbres (CT) or vibration on
the forearm, and rated pleasantness and intensity.  Prior and after, stress response (cortisol and heart rate
variability), reward sensitivity, mood and interoceptive awareness were measured. 
Results: Pleasantness decreased over time for both groups, with brush stroking being perceived as more pleasant
and intense than vibration.
