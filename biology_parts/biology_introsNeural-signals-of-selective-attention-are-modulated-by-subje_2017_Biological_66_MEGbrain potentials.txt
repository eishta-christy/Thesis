Recent evidence has shown that brain activity measured with the
event-related potentials (ERP) method co-varies with preferences for
consumer goods (Junghöfer Name, 2010; Pozharliev, Verbeke, Van
Strien, & Bagozzi, 2015; Schaefer, Buratto, Goto, & Brotherhood, 2016;
Telpaz, Webb, & Levy, 2015).  This is an important development in an
emerging ﬁeld – consumer neuroscience – that aims to investigate
consumer behaviour (CB) with neuroscience methods.  The results from
two of these studies (Telpaz Name, 2015; Junghofer Name, 2010) suggest
that early brain potentials (neural signals occurring less than 300 ms
after participants ﬁrst see the image of a consumer good) can index
consumer preferences. 
These results can be interpreted from the perspective of the “motivated attention” theoretical
framework (Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert,
1997; Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006), which contends that similar early
ERPs reﬂect automatic attentional processes towards motivationally
relevant stimuli (Olofsson, Nordin, Sequeira, & Polich, 2008; Schupp,
Flaisch Name, 2006; Walker Name, 2011).  However, a striking aspect of
ERP studies of CB is that they do not report consistent links between
consumer preferences and late ERP positivities, which are often

modulated by motivationally relevant stimuli (Olofsson Name, 2008),
and are thought to reﬂect post-perceptive and controlled selective attention processes (Schupp, Stockburger Name, 2006).  In order to investigate this issue, the primary goal of this study was to examine the
ERP correlates of consumer preferences with a particular focus on late
ERP positivities.  In the remainder of this section we brieﬂy review past
work on motivated attention processes and their electrophysiological
correlates.  We then review existing ERP studies of consumer behaviour
and provide an overview of the present study.

Motivated attention is classically separated in two subprocesses: A
quick, “preattentive” mechanism of attentional orientation; and a more1996;

notion that, from a neurobiological perspective, attention is seen as the

processes by aﬀective-motivational factors can occur through two different routes.  First a “quick” route would involve subcortical structures
predominantly involved in the evaluation of motivational relevance
(e. g.  the amygdala; Pessoa & Adolphs, 2010; Schaefer Name, 2006). 
These structures would detect the presence of motivationally relevant
information in the environment through sensory inputs and would
subsequently modulate activity in sensory cortices through relatively
direct pathways (Vuilleumier & Huang, 2009).  This route is classically
thought to be automatic (Vuilleumier, Armony, Driver, & Dolan, 2001),
although evidence suggests that it can be modulated by top-down
controlled processes (Pessoa, McKenna, Gutierrez, & Ungerleider, 2002;
Pessoa, Padmala, & Morland, 2005). 
The second pathway of motivated attention is one in which neocortical networks (mainly frontal and parietal areas) receive inputs
conveying emotional information, and subsequently modulate sensory
cortices.  This mechanism is thought to be linked to overt and controlled
attentional processes (LeDoux, 1996; Vuilleumier & Huang, 2009).  Beyond the main theoretical distinction between a quick “preattentive”
and a slower overt attentional response, a third process is often proposed in which attentional resources would be allocated to motivationally-relevant stimuli in a temporally sustained manner.  This third
subtype of motivated attention would most likely involve working
memory (WM) processes and facilitate a more elaborative processing of
motivationally-relevant
information (Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006;
Watts, Buratto, Brotherhood, Barnacle, & Schaefer, 2014). 
scalp sites
ERP researchers have identiﬁed three types of brain potentials to
emotional pictures that map onto the three attentional subprocesses
described above.  As some of us explained in previous articles (Walker
Name, 2011; Watts Name, 2014), ERPs to stimuli of higher motivational
relevance (e. g.  emotional stimuli, faces, aﬀective stimuli) can be divided into three subtypes.  First, pre–400 ms ERPs to motivationally
relevant stimuli are thought to reﬂect a rapid and automatic orientation
of attention triggered by evolutionary and/or motivationally relevant
properties of external stimuli (Mavratzakis, Herbert, & Walla, 2016;
Olofsson Name, 2008; Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006).  Second, an ERP
called “Late positive potential” has often been observed after 400 ms
following the onset of a motivationally relevant stimulus.  This ERP is
characterised by a strong positivity that can be observed across the
entire scalp with maxima in posterior
(Codispoti,
Ferrari, & Bradley, 2007; Schupp Name, 2000).  The latencies of this effect vary across studies but they tend to be predominant between 400
and 800 ms (Codispoti, De Cesarei, & Ferrari, 2012).  The LPP is thought
to reﬂect overt, post-perceptive attentional responses to motivationallyrelevant stimuli that are more sustained in time and for which the involvement of controlled processes would be more important than the
pre–400 ms eﬀects (Codispoti Name, 2007; Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006;
Walker Name, 2011).  Third, a more sustained ERP positivity for motivationally relevant pictures has been observed after 800 ms post-stimulus onset.  This eﬀect consists of a sustained waveform that can last a
few seconds after stimulus onset (Diedrich, Naumann, Maier, & Becker,2006;
Hajcak & Olvet, 2008).  The topography of this eﬀect is often widely
distributed across the scalp over both fronto-central and centro-parietal
sites (Foti & Hajcak, 2008; Hajcak & Olvet, 2008).  These ERP eﬀects are
commonly labeled as positive slow waves (PSW) (Schupp, Flaisch Name,
2006) or as “late LPP” (Leutgeb, Schäfer, & Schienle, 2009; Schienle,
K & chel, & Leutgeb, 2011), and they are thought to reﬂect sustained
attentional processes related to the maintenance and potential manipulation of information in working memory (Schupp, Flaisch Name,Hajcak & Nieuwenhuis,
Foti & Hajcak,2.  Event-related brain potential studies of consumer behaviour
The vast majority of studies investigating the ERP correlates of
motivational relevance have used stimuli conveying an intrinsic emotional and evolutionary meaning, such as pictures of faces displayingif
that determines
emotional expressions or pictures of emotional scenes (e. g.  dead bodies,
scenes of violence and threat, etc. ).  It is not yet well established if these
results can be generalized to objects that have acquired their motivational relevance because of their economic value.  We deﬁne the economic value of an object as the computation of subjective beneﬁts andan object will be preferred (see
Levy & Glimcher, 2012; Montague & Berns, 2002).  The choice of acquiring an object is thought to be strongly determined by its economic
value (Padoa-Schioppa & Assad, 2006).  The evaluation of the economic
value of an object is thought to involve the assessment of the value of
several of its attributes, and this process can vary across diﬀerent types
of objects.  However, it is believed that the human brain can represent
this information into a “common scale” of value that allows comparing
between diﬀerent potential choices (Levy & Glimcher, 2012). 
Importantly, it has been suggested that the economic value of objects and
actions can be determined by a previous history of gains and losses that
can be understood from the perspective of reinforcement learning
models (Montague & Berns, 2002; Schaefer Name, 2016), although it is
often suggested that a number of contextual eﬀects can also modulate
these valuation processes (Kalwani, Yim, Rinne, & Sugita, 1990). al. ,2007;Consumer goods are typical examples of objects that have acquired
motivational relevance through their economic value, as the “desire to
own” (Knutson, Rick, Wimmer, Prelec, & Loewenstein, 2007) a consumer good is largely determined by an evaluation of its subjective
beneﬁts and costs (Kalwani Name, 1990; Knutson Name, 2007; Winer,
1986).  However, despite a recent surge of studies using neuroimaging
(Karmarkar, Shiv, & Knutson, 2014; Knutson Name, 2007; Plassmann,
O’Doherty, & Rangel,Bode, & Haynes, 2010) and psychophysiological methods (e. g.  Rasch,
Louviere, & Teichert, 2015; Walla, Brenner, & Koller, 2011) to investigate consumer behaviour, only a very limited number of studies
have approached this question using the ERP method.  Previous studies
that have examined ERPs related to preferences for consumer goods
have focused mainly on early (pre-400) ERPs.  For instance, Telpaz Name
(2015) found a relationship between the N200 component and product
preferences measured by a behavioural choice procedure in which
participants needed to choose between pairs of products.  Telpaz Name
(2015) suggested that this N200 eﬀect could reﬂect an eﬀect of the
Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN), an ERP component that overlaps
with the N200, and which has been linked to the evaluation of prediction errors
(Mushtaq, Wilkie, MonWilliams, & Schaefer, 2016), and more recently, to positive surprise and
buying preferences in a virtual shopping task (Schaefer Name, 2016). 
Furthermore, a study using magnetoencephalography (MEG) found that
early brain potentials (between 110 and 230 ms post-stimulus onset)
reﬂecting motivated attention were related to gender-speciﬁc preferences for consumer goods (Junghöfer Name, 2010). 
in decision-making tasks
Although these studies provide evidence in favour of the notion of
the involvement of early attentional responses in consumer preferences,
evidence regarding later eﬀects is scant and contradictory.
