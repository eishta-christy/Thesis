d The transcription of fbxl4 in lLNvs is CLOCK dependent
d Fbxl4 regulates sleep through rhythmically modulating the
excitability of lLNvs
In Brief
The circadian clock regulates the timing
of sleep, but the underlying mechanisms
are still not fully understood.  Li Name
showed that CLOCK-dependent Fbxl4
expression rhythmically downregulated
GABAA receptors to increase the activity
of pacemaker neurons and promote
wakefulness.
