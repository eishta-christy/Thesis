several generations following repression, a conserved
phenomenon called epigenetic transcriptional memory.  Following previous growth in galactose, GAL
gene transcriptional memory confers a strong ﬁtness
beneﬁt in Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapting to
growth in galactose for up to 8 generations.  A genetic
screen for mutants defective for GAL gene memory revealed new insights into the molecular mechanism,
adaptive consequences, and evolutionary history of
memory.  A point mutation in the Gal1 co-activator
that disrupts the interaction with the Gal80 inhibitor
speciﬁcally and completely disrupted memory.  This
mutation conﬁrms that cytoplasmically inherited
Gal1 produced during previous growth in galactose
directly interferes with Gal80 repression to promote
faster induction of GAL genes.  This mitotically heritable mode of regulation is recently evolved;diverged Saccharomyces species, GAL genes show
constitutively faster activation due to genetically
encoded basal expression of Gal1.  Thus, recently
diverged species utilize either epigenetic or genetic
strategies to regulate the same molecular mechanism.  The screen also revealed that the central
domain of the Gal4 transcription factor both regulates
the stochasticity of GAL gene expression and potentiates stronger GAL gene activation in the presence
of Gal1.  The central domain is critical for GAL gene
transcriptional memory; Gal4 lacking the central
domain fails to potentiate GAL gene expression and
is unresponsive to previous Gal1 expression. 
INTRODUCTION
Transcriptional adaptation to ﬂuctuations in nutrient availability is
critical for ﬁtness [1].  In response to previous experiences,
certain inducible genes show a mitotically heritable increase in
the rate of transcription [2–12].  This epigenetic phenomenon,
referred as transcriptional memory,
is observed in yeast,
Drosophila, and humans [5, 7, 13].  However, its evolutionary
history and adaptive impact have not been explored.  Also,
whereas some aspects of transcriptional memory are deeply
conserved, gene-speciﬁc features also occur [4, 6, 8, 14], suggesting that gene-speciﬁc regulatory systems can be regulated
by transcriptional memory. 
In S.  cerevisiae, GAL genes exhibit transcriptional memory. 
These genes are speciﬁcally induced in galactose to mediate
galactose utilization [15, 16].  When cells are shifted from glucose
to galactose, the initial rate of induction of GAL genes is very
slow; the Gal1 protein reaches steady-state levels 10 hr after
shifting from glucose to galactose (Figure 1B; compared with
the doubling time of budding yeast, 1. 5–2 hr).  However, in cells
that have been previously grown in galactose, GAL genes are
rapidly reactivated.  This phenomenon persists in the population
for 7 or 8 cell divisions after repression in glucose [2, 11, 14, 17]. 
Like other genes that show memory, GAL transcriptional
memory is also associated with changes in chromatin structure,
leading to a state that is poised for faster reactivation [14]. 
The initial induction of GAL genes is slow in part because, in
most cells, there are fewer molecules of the Gal3 co-activator
than the Gal80 inhibitor [11, 18].  Consequently, the expression
is initially heterogeneous, with some cells responding and others
not [18].  On the other hand, during memory, reactivation is more
uniform [18].  GAL memory requires the Gal1 galactokinase, a
paralog of Gal3 [2, 11, 14, 17].  Gal1 is abundantly produced in
galactose, extremely stable, and diluted very slowly after repression in glucose [14].  A few hundred molecules of Gal1 are necessary and sufﬁcient to produce the effects of memory, including
the changes in chromatin structure over the GAL1 promoter
and uniformity of expression [11, 14].  Because both Gal1 and
Gal3 can interact with Gal80 to relieve inhibition of the Gal4 activator [19–23], this leads to a model whereby residual Gal1 allows
cells to more rapidly overcome Gal80 repression and rapidly
induce GAL genes during memory (Figure 1A). 
Here, we explored the adaptive value, evolutionary history,
and molecular mechanism of GAL gene transcriptional memory. 
In S.  cerevisiae, GAL transcriptional memory confers a strong
adaptive advantage, allowing much faster adaptation to
galactose and better utilization of mixed sugars.  In contrast,
S.  uvarum, a divergent Saccharomyces species, does not beneﬁt
from previous growth in galactose but instead shows constitutively fast GAL gene activation due to basal GAL1 expression. 
Replacing the GAL1 promoter in S.  cerevisiae with that from
S.  uvarum recapitulated this difference in behavior, conﬁrming
that the basal expression of Gal1 and the resulting fast activation

of other GAL genes are genetically encoded by this promoter. 
Using a point mutation in Gal1 that disrupts the interaction with
Gal80, we demonstrate that fast induction of GAL genes in
both species results from a physical interaction between Gal1
and Gal80.  A screen for mutants that block GAL memory downstream of Gal1 identiﬁed a mutation in Gal4 central domain (CD),
revealing a critical role for this domain in transcriptional memory
downstream of both Gal1 and Gal80.  The CD serves to potentiate Gal4 activation, and this function is regulated by Gal80. 
Ectopically expressed CD complemented deletion of the CD in
trans and was recruited to chromatin-bound Gal4Dcd, suggesting that potentiation is the result of an inter-domain interaction
within Gal4.  Thus, recently diverged species employ either

Transcriptional Memory Enhances Fitness by Promoting
Uniform, Rapid Activation of GAL Genes
Because Gal1 is both necessary and sufﬁcient to promote faster
induction of GAL genes during memory, Gal1 most likely interacts with Gal80 to allow rapid de-repression of GAL genes
(Figure 1A).  The relative rates of GAL1 transcription can be
compared by measuring Gal1-mCherry ﬂuorescence expressed

using ﬂow cytometry [11, 14].  In cells that had not been previously exposed to galactose (i. e. , naive cells), Gal1-mCherry
was undetectable for the ﬁrst 4 hr after shifting from glucose to
galactose (Figures 1B and 1D, ACT).  Between 4 hr and 8 hr after
switching cells to galactose, expression of Gal1-mCherry was
apparent in a subset of cells in the population (i. e. , bimodal
expression; Figures 1B and 1D, ACT).  After 10 hr in galactose,
the entire population expressed Gal1-mCherry (Figure 1D,
ACT).  In contrast, in cells that were previously grown in galactose
and then repressed for 12 hr (7 or 8 cell divisions; i. e. , memory),
the population responded uniformly and rapidly; Gal1-mCherry
ﬂuorescence was measurable within 4 hr after shifting back to
galactose (unimodal expression; Figures 1B and 1D, REACT). 
Likewise, ectopic expression of GAL1 promoted both rapid
and unimodal accumulation of Gal1-mCherry (Figures 1B and
1D, ACT + eGAL1) [11, 14, 17, 24].  Furthermore, consistent
with the model in Figure 1A, either loss of Gal80 or a point mutation in Gal4 (V864E) that disrupts the interaction with Gal80 [25]
also resulted in rapid, unimodal expression of Gal1-mCherry
(Figures 1C and 1D).  Thus, memory leads to faster and more
uniform GAL1 transcriptional activation, most likely by promoting rapid and uniform relief of Gal80 repression. 
To quantify the adaptive effect of faster reactivation of GAL
genes during memory, we followed the growth kinetics upon
shifting cells from glucose to galactose (Figure 1E).  Naive cells
exhibited a long growth lag before entering exponential phase
(Figure 1E, ACT).  In contrast, during memory or in cells ectopically expressing Gal1, adaptation was much faster (Figure 1E,
REACT and ACT + eGAL1).  Although the growth rates were ultimately similar once cells reached exponential phase, memory
confers a large ﬁtness beneﬁt by decreasing the growth lag after
shifting cells from glucose to galactose (Figure 1E, gray circles). 
Rapid GAL gene activation in fungal species is also associated
with increased responsiveness to low concentrations of galactose [26–28].  During memory or in cells expressing ectopic
Gal1, Gal1-mCherry was expressed at higher levels in media
with low concentrations of galactose (Figure 1F).  Because yeast
cells are most likely exposed to mixtures of sugars in nature, we
asked whether this higher sensitivity for galactose also impacts
the expression of Gal1-mCherry in the presence of glucose. 
S.  cerevisiae normally does not induce GAL genes in the presence of low levels of glucose (0. 2% glucose and 1. 8% galactose;
Figure 1G, inset).  However, during memory or in the presence of
ectopic Gal1, Gal1-mCherry expression was observed in the
presence of glucose (Figure 1G,
inset).  This Gal1-mCherry
expression correlated with a ﬁtness beneﬁt in 0. 2% glucose +
1. 8% galactose medium. 
In this medium, once glucose is
exhausted after 7 hr of growth, naive cells exhibited a signiﬁcant lag before adapting to galactose (Figure 1G) [27, 29, 30]. 
However, during memory or in the presence of ectopic Gal1,
this lag was absent and cells adapted immediately to galactose
(Figure 1G).  Thus, transcriptional memory provides a strong
adaptive advantage in both galactose and glucose-galactose
mixtures. 
Gal1-D117V Disrupts the Interaction with Gal80,
Speciﬁcally Blocking GAL Transcriptional Memory
To explore the molecular basis of faster reactivation of GAL
genes during memory, we performed a genetic screen based
on ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).  After 4 hr in galactose, strong expression of Gal1-mCherry occurs during reactivation, but not during activation (Figures 1D and 2A).  We exploited
this difference to sort for GAL memory mutants: UV-mutagenized cells that failed to express Gal1-mCherry after 4 hr of
reactivation (Figure 2A; sort I) but expressed Gal1-mCherry after
12 hr in galactose (Figure 2A; sort II).  This second sort removed
mutants or those that had lost Gal1-mCherry expression. The recovered cells were colony puriﬁed and screened by ﬂow
cytometry to identify those that speciﬁcally lost rapid GAL1
reactivation during memory. Based on the model in Figure 1A, we expected to identify null
alleles of Gal1.  We removed many such mutants by focusing on
those that were able to grow on galactose (Gal1 is required to
grow on galactose; data not shown).  The screen also identiﬁed
an allele of GAL1 that was Gal+ but speciﬁcally blocked memory;
gal1-D117V reduced the rate of Gal1-mCherry reactivation
during memory without altering the rate of activation of Gal1mCherry (Figure 2B).  Reconstruction of the gal1-D117V mutation
into the GAL1 locus recapitulated these phenotypes (data not
shown), conﬁrming that this mutation is causative.  gal1-D117V
cells also lost the ﬁtness beneﬁt of memory; the growth of
gal1-D117V during reactivation closely resembled the growth
of naive wild-type cells during activation (Figure 2C).  This mutation had no effect on Gal1-mCherry stability (Figure S1B) or the
rate of activation (Figure 2B) and only slightly affected the rate
of exponential growth in galactose (Figure 2C).  Finally, the
effects of this mutation were recessive because ectopic expression of Gal1 in gal1-D117V led to faster Gal1-mCherry expression (Figure S1C) and rapid adaptation to growth in galactose
(Figure S1D).  Thus,
the gal1-D117V mutation speciﬁcally
disrupts memory without signiﬁcantly affecting other functions
of Gal1. 
The structures of Gal1, Gal3, and Gal3-Gal80 are known
[20, 31].  Gal1 and Gal3 show 74% sequence identity and are
structurally superimposable with a root mean square deviation
of 1. 1 A˚
(Figure S1A) [20, 31].  Aspartate 117 maps to the
predicted interaction surface between Gal1 and Gal80.  In the
Gal3-Gal80 structure, Gal3-Asp111 is at the structurally equivalent position to Gal1-Asp117 and forms an ionic bond with
Gal80-Arg367 (Figures 2D and S1A)
[20].  To test whether
disrupting this salt bridge reduces the afﬁnity between Gal1
and Gal80, we performed co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type
and D117V Gal1-mCherry with Gal80-myc.  Although these
proteins were expressed at similar levels, immunoprecipitation
(E) Lysates from strains expressing Gal80-13xmyc and Gal1-mCherry were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation using anti-myc antibody.  The immunoprecipitated fractions (IP) (top), the input fractions (middle), and the supernatant fraction after immunodepletion (bottom) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted against either mCherry (top two panels) or the myc epitope tag (bottom panels).

The yeast strains and the number of biological replicates for all experiments are listed in Tables S1 and S2, respectively.  Additional characterization of gal1-D117V

of Gal80 recovered only 20% of Gal1-D117V compared with
wild-type Gal1 (Figure 2E).  This reduced afﬁnity for Gal80 led
to slow, bimodal expression of Gal1-mCherry during both activation and reactivation (Figure 2F).  Furthermore, a complementary
mutant in Gal80 (R367L) predicted to disrupt the salt bridge
phenotype
between Gal80 and both Gal3 and Gal1 led to a Gal
(data not shown).  Thus, interaction between Gal1 and Gal80
plays a critical role in GAL gene transcriptional memory. Constitutively Fast GAL Expression in S.  uvarum Is due
to Higher Basal Expression of Gal1
S.  uvarum diverged from S.  cerevisiae 20 million years ago and
has evolved a distinct strategy for adapting to growth in galactose (Figure S2A) [27, 32, 33].  We asked whether this species
beneﬁts from previous growth in galactose.  Although the rate
of Gal1-mCherry reactivation during memory was slightly faster
than the rate of activation in S.  uvarum (Figures 3A and S2B),
this difference was much smaller than that observed in S.  cerevisiae (Figure 3B).  Moreover, in S.  uvarum, previous growth in
galactose did not lead to a ﬁtness beneﬁt (Figure 3C).  This
suggests that the rapid initial GAL gene induction in S.  uvarum
is sufﬁcient
to provide maximal ﬁtness beneﬁt and that
increasing this rate further provides no additional effect. 
Several differences between S.  uvarum and S.  cerevisiae
might explain the difference in their response to previous growth
in galactose; S.  uvarum has higher basal expression of the key
activators GAL1, GAL3, and GAL4 and lower expression of
the GAL80 inhibitor [27, 33].  Thus, differences in cis-acting
elements in the promoter, trans-acting factors, or both could
lead to constitutive fast GAL gene expression.  To investigate
these possibilities, we substituted the GAL1 promoter (PGAL1)
in S.  cerevisiae with PGAL1 from S.  uvarum.  In this strain, induction of Gal1-mCherry during both activation and reactivation
was as fast as reactivation in wild-type cells (Figure 3D).  Thus,
PGAL1 from S.  uvarum is sufﬁcient to induce constitutively fast
GAL1 expression in S.  cerevisiae without any other uvarum
factors. 
The effects of PGAL1 from S.  uvarum are consistent with this
promoter being more easily induced.  Hybrid cerevisiae-uvarum
promoters suggest that this effect is largely explained by differences in the UASGAL elements and GAL1-proximal sequences
(Figures S2C–S2E)
[34].  However, because epigenetic GAL
gene transcriptional memory in S.  cerevisiae requires only a
few hundred molecules of Gal1 per cell [14], very low basal
expression of Gal1 by PGAL1 from S.  uvarum might also cause
this faster induction through a positive feedback mechanism. 
To distinguish between these possibilities, we asked whether
S.  cerevisiae with the S.  uvarum PGAL1 also promoted faster
activation of other GAL genes in trans.  In cells bearing the S.  uvarum PGAL1, the rate of Gal7-Venus activation and reactivation
was as fast as that observed during memory in wild-type S.  cerevisiae (Figure 3E).  Likewise, S.  uvarum PGAL1 promoted faster
adaptation to galactose (Figure 3F).  Thus, the S.  uvarum PGAL1
is sufﬁcient to induce constitutive fast activation of GAL genes
in trans and faster adaptation to galactose, most likely through
basal Gal1 production. 
Whereas the levels of basal Gal1 protein in cells having the
PGAL1 from S.  uvarum were below the level of detection using
either ﬂow cytometry or immunoblot, qRT-PCR revealed that
this promoter led to a signiﬁcant increase in GAL1 mRNA in cells
grown in glucose (p = 0. 03; Student’s t test; Figure 3F, inset) [27]. 
If this basal expression were causative, then disrupting the interaction between Gal1 and Gal80 should block this effect.  Indeed,
introduction of the gal1-D117A mutation into the S.  cerevisiae
strain harboring the S.  uvarum PGAL1 blocked the cis and trans
effects of this promoter on expression (Figures 3G and 3H) and
growth (Figure 3I).  Thus, constitutive fast GAL genes induction
conferred by the S.  uvarum PGAL1 is due to genetically encoded
basal expression of Gal1 that impinges upon the same molecular
mechanism employed during epigenetic transcriptional memory
in S.  cerevisiae. 
Fitness Costs of Constitutive GAL1 Expression
If faster GAL genes expression promotes adaptation to galactose, why is it restricted to memory in S.  cerevisiae? Basal
Gal1 expression is detrimental to growth in glucose-galactose
mixtures because the galactose-1-phosphate generated by
the galactokinase activity of Gal1 inhibits phosphoglucomutase
and slows glycolysis [27, 35].  Consistent with this model,
S.  cerevisiae expressing ectopic GAL1 or S.  uvarum showed a
measurable growth disadvantage when adapting from glucose
to a glucose-galactose mixture (1:1 ratio; 1% each sugar;
Figures S3A and S3B).  Competitive growth experiments
between wild-type S.  cerevisiae and S.  cerevisiae harboring
the S.  uvarum PGAL1 also showed a ﬁtness cost to basal
expression of Gal1 (Figure S3C).  Thus, consistent with previous
studies, basal GAL1 expression can have both positive and
negative effects on ﬁtness; it promotes adaptation from glucose
to galactose but is detrimental in glucose-galactose mixtures
[29, 36]. 
The Gal4 CD Promotes Stronger Transcription during
GAL Memory
In addition to the gal1-D117V mutant, which showed speciﬁc
loss of memory without strong effects on activation, the ﬂow
cytometry screen also identiﬁed a mutation in Gal4 (L282P)
that both blocked memory and led to defective activation of
Gal1-mCherry (Figure S4A).  This mutation most likely destabilizes the Gal4 protein, leading to lower protein levels (Figure S4A,
inset).  However, this mutation was interesting because it was
resistant to ectopic expression of Gal1 (Figure S4A), conﬁrming
that the loss of memory in gal4-L282P cells was not simply an
effect of lower levels of Gal1 during reactivation.  Thus, Gal4L282P both causes a defect in activation and blocks memory
downstream of Gal1. 
The gal4-L282P mutation lies within the CD of Gal4 (Gal4-239767; Figure 4A) [37].  In other members of the zinc binuclear cluster transcription factor family, the CD has been proposed to have
a regulatory function [38–41].  However, the role of Gal4 CD is
unclear; deletion of this domain produces a largely functional
activator, but mutations in this domain disrupt Gal4 function
[37, 42]. 
To explore the role of the Gal4 CD, we tested how loss of this
domain affected memory and the response to Gal1.  Unlike Gal4L282P, Gal4Dcd protein levels were similar to full-length Gal4
protein levels (Figure 4B, inset) and the rate of Gal1-mCherry
activation was similar in gal4Dcd and wild-type cells (Figure 4B)
[37].  However, cells lacking the CD showed no memory

that is associated with GAL transcriptional memory and is
induced by ectopic expression of Gal1 [14], was still observed
in cells lacking the Gal4 CD (Figure S4D).  Therefore, the gal4Dcd
mutant blocked memory downstream of both Gal1 and chromatin changes associated with memory (Figure S4C). 
Given the weak sequence conservation of the CD, we asked
whether CD promotes memory by acting as a spacer to increase

the access of the activation domain to co-activators.  The CD was
replaced either with domains 12–16 of human b-spectrin, which
should function as a spacer of similar size to the CD [43], or with
the CD from Leu3, a related transcription factor [40, 44]. 
Although these hybrid proteins supported Gal1-mCherry expression, they blocked memory and were unresponsive to Gal1 (Figures 4C and 4D).  Thus, the Gal4 CD has a sequence-speciﬁc
function in potentiating expression and is neither a simple spacer
nor a generic, swappable domain. 
Because Gal3 has a higher afﬁnity for Gal80 than Gal1 [23],
loss of memory could result if Gal4Dcd is de-repressed normally
by Gal3 but is unresponsive to Gal1 (Figure 1A).  To test this hypothesis, we asked whether Gal1 could replace Gal3 to promote
activation of Gal1-mCherry.  In cells lacking Gal3, Gal1-mCherry

Is Regulated by Gal80 Potentiates Gal4
Activation
(A) Confocal micrograph showing nuclear localization of the Gal4 CD-GFP expressed from PADH1
(eCD-GFP) in cells having the nuclear envelope/
endoplasmic reticulum marked with a RFP-tagged
protein. 
(B) Schematic for the experimental setup in (C)–(F). 
Gal80 dimer binds to the activation domain of
Gal4Dcd and to eCD. 
(C, D, and F) Gal1-mCherry ﬂuorescence relative
to CFP in presence of eCD and eCDmut (L282P). 
(C) gal4Dcd mutant with or without eGAL1.  Inset:
immunoblot of eCD-GFP and eCDmut-GFP.  (D)
gal4Dcd or gal4Dcd gal80D mutants.  (F) Wild-type
cells with and without eGAL1. 
(E) ChIP against eCD-GFP or eCDmut-GFP in the
indicated strains.  Recovery of the GAL1 promoter
and a control
locus, PRM1, were quantiﬁed
relative to input by real-time qPCR.  *p % 0. 05
(Student’s t test) relative to the ChIP enrichment ofError bars represent SEM from R3 biological
replicates for Gal1-mCherry ﬂuorescence and R3
replicated for ChIP experiments.  The yeast strains
and the number of biological replicates for all
experiments are listed in Tables S1 and S2,
respectively.  Further characterization of eCD is
shown in Figure S5.  See also Figure S4. (gal4-V864E) signiﬁcantly increased the
overall rate of activation in the gal4Dcd
cells (Figures 4F and 4G).  Thus, the Gal4
CD operates downstream of Gal80 to
regulate bimodal expression and potentiates maximal expression during memory. 
the Gal4 CD completely
blocked Gal80 repression, it should lead
to expression of Gal1-mCherry in rafﬁnose medium because Gal80 is the sole
repressor of GAL genes expression in rafﬁnose.  In rafﬁnose,
whereas either loss of Gal80 or loss of the interaction between
Gal4 and Gal80 (gal4-V864E) [25] led to de-repression of Gal1mCherry, deletion of the CD alone did not (Figure S4C).
