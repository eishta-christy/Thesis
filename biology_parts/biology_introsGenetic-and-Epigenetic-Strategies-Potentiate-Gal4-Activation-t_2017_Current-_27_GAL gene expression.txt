In Brief
Sood and Brickner ﬁnd that faster GAL
gene induction during transcriptional
memory accelerates adaptation to
galactose and requires both previously
produced Gal1 to relieve Gal80
repression and the Gal4 central domain,
which potentiates stronger activation. 
Related yeasts use either genetic or
epigenetic means to alter GAL gene
activation rates.

several generations following repression, a conserved
phenomenon called epigenetic transcriptional memory.  Following previous growth in galactose, GAL
gene transcriptional memory confers a strong ﬁtness
beneﬁt in Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapting to
growth in galactose for up to 8 generations.  A genetic
screen for mutants defective for GAL gene memory revealed new insights into the molecular mechanism,
adaptive consequences, and evolutionary history of
memory.  A point mutation in the Gal1 co-activator
that disrupts the interaction with the Gal80 inhibitor
speciﬁcally and completely disrupted memory.  This
mutation conﬁrms that cytoplasmically inherited
Gal1 produced during previous growth in galactose
directly interferes with Gal80 repression to promote
faster induction of GAL genes.  This mitotically heritable mode of regulation is recently evolved;diverged Saccharomyces species, GAL genes show
constitutively faster activation due to genetically
encoded basal expression of Gal1.  Thus, recently
diverged species utilize either epigenetic or genetic
strategies to regulate the same molecular mechanism.  The screen also revealed that the central
domain of the Gal4 transcription factor both regulates
the stochasticity of GAL gene expression and potentiates stronger GAL gene activation in the presence
of Gal1.  The central domain is critical for GAL gene
transcriptional memory; Gal4 lacking the central
domain fails to potentiate GAL gene expression and
is unresponsive to previous Gal1 expression.
