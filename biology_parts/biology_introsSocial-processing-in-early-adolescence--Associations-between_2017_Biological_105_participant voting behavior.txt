Examining dimensions of social processing at multiple levels of
analysis (e. g. , self-report, behavior, physiology, circuits) has the potential to inform understanding of both typical and atypical development (e. g. , Morris & Cuthbert, 2012).  Yet, measurement of social processes, such as aﬃliation and attachment (National Institute of Mental
Health, 2017), poses unique challenges for multi-method assessment. 
That is, special consideration is needed in order to develop methods
that simulate real-world social interactions while also allowing for the
collection of levels of data that require specialized equipment (e. g. ,
electroencephalogram [EEG] or functional magnetic resonance imaging
[fMRI]). 
Adolescence marks a period of increasing importance of peer relationships and the development of more supportive, close friendships
(Steinberg & Morris, 2001).  In addition, risk for many internalizing
disorders increases in adolescence (Costello, Egger, & Angold, 2005;
Kessler, Avenevoli, & Ries Merikangas, 2001), and extensive data support a connection between social processes and the development of
both depression and anxiety.  For example, positive peer relationships
appear protective against the development of symptoms, whereas interpersonal stressors, including maladaptive social interactions, peer
victimization, and loss of relationships are consistently linked to risk for
internalizing symptoms (Hammen, 2005; Hawker & Boulton, 2000; La
Greca & Harrison, 2005; Vrshek-Schallhorn Name, 2015). 
There has been growing interest in tasks to assess social processes in
youth at the neural level.  Some of the earliest work on brain circuits
used the Cyberball task, a computerized ball-tossing game that elicits
reactivity to social exclusion Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams, 2003;
Williams, Cheung, & Choi, 2000), with more recently developed fMRI
tasks involving the exchange of personal information and pretense of
more direct feedback from peers.  For example, in the Chat Room task,
participants rate how interested they are in participating in an online
chat with peers, and then receive feedback regarding whether those
peers were interested in chatting with them (Guyer Name, 2008).  In the
Social Network Aggression Task, participants are told that peers reviewed their personal proﬁles, and then receive positive, negative, and
neutral feedback on their proﬁles, followed by the chance to retaliate
against simulated peers (Achterberg Name, 2017).  In the Virtual School
Paradigm, participants create personal proﬁles and avatars that they
then use to interact live with simulated peers who direct both positive
and negative evaluative comments to the participant (Jarcho Name,
2016).  Findings from these task have begun to reveal circuits involved
in social feedback processing, including regions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), insula, striatum and
amygdala (Achterberg Name, 2017; Guyer, Choate, Pine, & Nelson,

Though still in the early stages, evidence from neuroimaging suggests that social feedback tasks may be useful for examining altered
social processing in relation to depression and anxiety in youth.  For
example, youth with major depressive disorder (MDD) have been
shown to exhibit altered patterns of neural activation to rejection in the
Chat Room Interact task (Silk Name, 2014), and preliminary evidence
indicates that youth at risk for depression show blunted responses to
social acceptance in reward processing regions such as the ventral
striatum (Olino, Silk, Osterritter, & Forbes, 2015).  There is also some
evidence to suggest that anxiety and anxiety risk are associated with
altered patterns of brain activation during anticipation and receipt of
negative peer feedback (Jarcho Name, 2013, 2016; Lau Name, 2012), and
social feedback tasks may be particularly relevant to the development
of social anxiety (Jarcho Name, 2013). for

(Banaschewski & Brandeis,Nelson & McCleery, 2008).  Yet, little work has examined EEG measures
of social feedback processing in youth.  The reward positivity (RewP),
also known as the feedback negativity, is an ERP component that appears as a relative positivity in response to positive or rewarding
feedback compared to negative feedback approximately 300 ms after
feedback over frontocentral sites (Foti, Weinberg, Dien, & Hajcak, 2011;
Gehring & Willoughby, 2002).  In monetary reward tasks, RewP is reliably assessed across development (Bress, Meyer, & Proudﬁt, 2015) and
correlates with activation in reward-related brain regions, including
ventral striatum and mPFC (Becker, Nitsch, Miltner, & Straube, 2014;
Carlson, Foti, Mujica-Parodi, Harmon-Jones, & Hajcak, 2011), as wellreward sensitivity
(Bress & Hajcak, 2013).  RewP to monetary rewards appears to be altered in those higher in internalizing symptoms, with evidence of a
blunted reward response in youth with elevated symptoms of depression and some evidence of an enhanced RewP in children with elevated
symptoms of social anxiety (Bress Name, 2015; Kessel, Kujawa,
Proudﬁt, & Klein, 2015). 
and behavioral measures of
self-report
We developed a novel task called Island Getaway to measure ERPs
including RewP to social acceptance and rejection feedback in youth
(Kujawa, Arfer, Klein, & Proudﬁt, 2014).  During the task, participants
vote to reject and accept simulated co-players, while also receiving a
combination of rejection and acceptance feedback from peers.  To simulate real
life interactions, participants and co-players exchange
personal information (e. g. , photograph, likes/dislikes, and interests)
throughout the task, and participants are led to believe that peer
feedback may be based on this information.  Following the task, participants complete a self-report measure of task engagement.  Our initial
pilot study (N = 19) indicated that an enhanced RewP was observable
following social acceptance feedback, a pattern that has also been observed in adult studies of social feedback processing (Dekkers, van der
Molen, Moor, van der Veen, & van der Molen, 2014; van der Molen,
Dekkers, Westenberg, van der Veen, & van der Molen, 2016).  Moreover,
our preliminary correlations indicated that this task may be useful for
examining eﬀects of depression and social anxiety on social feedback
processing.  Though these eﬀects were limited by the small sample size,
greater socieal anxiety symptoms correlated with a larger RewP to acceptance feedback, and greater depressive symptoms were associated
with a trend for a blunted RewP to acceptance (Kujawa, Arfer Name,The goals of the current study were to replicate and extend our
previous ﬁndings in a large sample of young adolescents (N = 412) and
reﬁne methods for applying ERPs to understanding social processes
across development.  Given limited data on ERPs to social feedback in
youth, our ﬁrst goal was to use principal components analysis (PCA) to
identify distinct components sensitive to social feedback and to bettercharacterize the timing and scalp distribution of the RewP in response
to social feedback.  Building on our previous work (Kujawa, Arfer Name,
2014), our second goal was to evaluate correlations between neurophysiological measures of sensitivity to social feedback (i. e. , RewP),
self-report (i. e. , task engagement), and behavioral measures (i. e. , tendency to reject peers) from the Island Getaway task.  Our ﬁnal goal was
to test the relevance of these measures to individual diﬀerences by
examining correlations with symptoms of depression and social anxiety.

2. 1.  Participants
Participants were part of a larger community sample of children
initially recruited when the children were 3 or 6 years old (Kujawa,
Proudﬁt, & Klein, 2014; Olino, Klein, Dyson, Rose, & Durbin, 2010). 
Participants were invited back to the laboratory when they were approximately 12 years old and completed a series of EEG tasks in a
counterbalanced order (descriptions and results of other tasks will be
presented in future manuscripts).  A total of 439 youth completed the
social feedback task.  Informed consent was obtained from all parents
and assent was obtained from participants.  Data were unavailable for 4
participants due to technical errors and 23 were excluded for excessive
noise in the EEG data, leaving data for 412 participants.  The mean age
was 12. 64 years (SD = 0. 47 years), and the sample was 46. 8% female,
13. 1% Hispanic/Latino, 89. 1% Caucasian, 7. 8% African American,
2. 4% Asian American, 0. 2% Native American, and 0. 5% other race. 
2. 2.  Measures
2. 2. 1.  Social feedback task
Participants completed the Island Getaway task (modiﬁed from
Kujawa, Arfer Name, 2014) while EEG data were recorded.  The task
code is available at: http://arfer. net/projects/survivor.  Participants
were told that they would be playing a game with eleven age-matched
co-players in which they would be travelling in the Hawaiian Islands,
and at each island, they would have to vote whether they wanted each
co-player to continue on with them to the next island and would then
receive feedback on how co-players voted for them.  Trials were divided
into 6 rounds.  In the ﬁrst round, participants created a proﬁle including
their photograph and demographic information and reviewed proﬁles
of computerized co-players.  In subsequent rounds, participants ﬁrst
responded to a poll question (e. g. , “Who do you most admire?”) and
reviewed co-player responses in order to facilitate an exchange of
personal information for the remaining voting and feedback phases (see
Kujawa, Arfer Name, 2014 for a depiction of the poll phase). 
Following review of proﬁles and poll responses in each round,
participants completed a voting and feedback phase (Fig.  1).  Participants were prompted to vote to either accept (“Keep”) or reject (“Kick
out”) each co-player, and after each vote, they then saw feedback indicating whether that co-player had voted to accept or reject them. 
Acceptance feedback was indicated by an image of a green “thumbs up”
and rejection feedback was indicated by a red “thumbs down. ” Each
voting trial began with a co-player proﬁle presented until participants
voted.  To simulate variation in co-player response speed, a co-player
voting time was selected for each trial based on actual variability in
participants’ voting speeds from previously collected data.  If participants voted faster than the simulated voting time for that co-player, the
message “Waiting for [co-player’s name] to vote…” was displayed. 
Lastly, a ﬁxation “+” was presented for 1000 ms, followed by feedback
displayed for 2000 ms.  A blank screen was presented for 1500 ms before the start of the next trial. 
Co-players were randomly assigned a voting pattern for each participant, such that 2 co-players rejected the participant on most (4 or 5
out of 6) rounds, 2 co-players accepted the participant on most rounds,
and the remaining 7 co-players were equally likely to accept or reject

the participant.  To increase unpredictability of feedback, all co-players
voted both to keep and kick out the participant at least once (with the
exception of the co-player excluded after the ﬁrst round).  Variability in
co-player voting patterns allows for examining participant voting behavior in response to distinct patterns of peer feedback, but the task did
not include enough feedback trials to examine average ERP responses to
feedback from speciﬁc co-players. 
After each of the rounds, participants were told that one of the coplayers had been sent home, and after completing the sixth, participants
were informed that they made it to the “Big Island.
