Diﬃculties in social-emotional processing are believed to play an
important role both in the onset and maintenance of anorexia nervosa
(AN) (Treasure, Corﬁeld, & Cardi, 2012; Treasure & Schmidt, 2013).  A
wide range of anomalies in social-emotional processing and reactivity
to emotional stimuli have been documented in people with acute AN
(Bora & Köse, 2016; Caglar-Nazali Name, 2014; Davies Name, 2016). 
Furthermore, longitudinal cohort studies have reported that diﬃculties
in social cognition and social communication at admission are important predictors of poor treatment outcome at 3- to 18-year follow-up
(Nielsen Name, 2015; Speranza, Loas, Wallier, & Corcos, 2007).  Thus,
these diﬃculties may contribute to the maintenance of the illness and
further understanding of these processes is of importance.
