Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious illness that aﬄicts up
to 10% of the adult population in the United States and represents one
of the leading causes of disability around the world [1].  With an estimated lifetime prevalence of more than 3. 5% in China [2], it is predicted to become the second leading cause of disability by the year
2020 [3].  Aside from mortality associated with suicide, depressed patients are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and type 2
diabetes than non-depressed patients [4]. 
Current treatments of MDD are based on improving clinical symptoms, such as low spirits, lack of lucidity, activity decline, and some
somatic symptoms.  Several eﬀective treatments for depressed patients
have been established, such as cognitive therapy [5], interpersonal
therapy [6], electroconvulsive therapy [7], electrical stimulation of the
vagus nerve [8], and pharmacotherapy with antidepressants.  Drug
therapy is currently the ﬁrst-line treatment.  Many antidepressants have
been approved for the treatment of MDD, such as selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, and norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors.  The
main SNRIs are duloxetine and venlafaxine [9].  Venlafaxine is a secondgeneration antidepressant that is widely used in a clinical context [10]. 
It can signiﬁcantly improve the clinical symptoms of patients with depression and its antidepressant eﬀects have been studied by our team
[11].  However, the molecular mechanism underlying its rapid antidepressant actions is unclear. 
The hippocampus is a major component of the brain in humans, and
it is an important part of the emotional center.  It is associated with a
variety of aﬀective disorders, and has therefore frequently been used as
a model system for neurophysiological studies.  Previous studies revealed that exposure to stressful experiences decreased proliferation
and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of adult animals [12,13], with

Metabolomics is the scientiﬁc study of chemical processes involving
metabolites.  It is also an approach frequently used in the study of the
pathogenesis of depression and the eﬀects of antidepressant drugs
[15–22].  Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), combining
the advantage of the high separation capacity of chromatography with
the high discriminant characteristics of mass spectrometry, is ideal for
the separation, and qualitative and quantitative analyses of complex
mixed samples [23]. 
To explore the potential biological eﬀects of venlafaxine on mouse
hippocampus, we applied a non-targeted metabolomic approach based
on GC–MS technology to characterize the global metabolic proﬁle in
mouse hippocampus following the systemic administration of venlafaxine.  The diﬀerentially expressed metabolites were analyzed to create
molecular interaction networks and the core proteins BDNF, p-c-Raf, pMAPK, p-MEK, p-AKT, and CREB involved in these networks were validated by western blotting.  Our primary aims were to identify the
biological mechanisms underlying the eﬀects of venlafaxine and to
provide new ideas for future research on antidepressants.

2. 1.  Animals
Twenty healthy male C57BL/6J mice, aged 8 weeks old and
weighing 18–20 g, were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center
of Chongqing Medical University (Chongqing, China).  During the entire
study, all of the experimental animals lived under simulated natural
light (12-h light/dark cycle), in an environment with optimal temperature (22 ± 1 °C) and appropriate humidity (50 ± 5%) with ad
libitum access to food and water.  All procedures in this study conformed to the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals (revised 1996) [24], and the study was approved
by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University.

(30 m × 0. 25 mm × 0. 25 μm) was used.  A total of 0. 5 μL of derivative
was injected into the capillary column.  The temperatures of the injection port, the EI iron source, and the quadrupole rods were 280 °C,
230 °C, and 150 °C, respectively.  Helium gas (purity > 99. 999%) acted
as a carrier gas with a ﬂow rate of 6 mL/min.  The temperature of the
capillary column was kept at 70 °C for 2 min, increased to 160 °C at a
rate of 6 °C/min, elevated to 240 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, increased to
300 °C at a higher rate of 20 °C/min, and then maintained at 300 °C for
6 min.  Mass spectrometry was performed in full scan mode and the
detection range was 50–600 (m/z). 
2. 5.  GC–MS data analysis
In this study, data preprocessing was carried out in the R software
platform, including baseline ﬁltering, peak identiﬁcation, integration,
retention time correction, peak alignment, and mass spectral fragmentation analysis.  Editing of data was performed after the analyses to
eliminate impurities from column loss and sample preparation in
Excel2010 software, and the ﬁnal results were converted to a 2D data
matrix.  This matrix included sample information, retention time, and
mass spectrometry data.  The normalized data matrix was imported into
the SIMCA-P 14. 1 software package (Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden). 
Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was
used to identify the metabolic diﬀerences between the groups.  Variable
important in projection (VIP) greater than 1 and p < 0. 05 were considered to indicate a signiﬁcant diﬀerence.  Seven-cycle interactive
veriﬁcation and the 200-response sequencing test method were used to
investigate the quality of the model.

All mice were randomly divided into a venlafaxine group (VLX
group) and a control group (CON group) after 1 week of adaptive
feeding.  The VLX group (n = 11) was intraperitoneally injected with
