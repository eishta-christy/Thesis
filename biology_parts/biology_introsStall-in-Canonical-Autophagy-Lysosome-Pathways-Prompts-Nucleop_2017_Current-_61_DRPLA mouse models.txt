The terminal stages of neuronal degeneration
and death in neurodegenerative diseases remain
elusive.  Autophagy is an essential catabolic process frequently failing in neurodegeneration.  Selective autophagy routes have recently emerged,
including nucleophagy, deﬁned as degradation of
nuclear components by autophagy.  Here, we
show that,
for the polyglutamine disease dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy
(DRPLA), progressive acquirement of an ataxic
phenotype is linked to severe cerebellar cellular pathology, characterized by nuclear degeneration
through nucleophagy-based LaminB1 degradation
and excretion.  We ﬁnd that canonical autophagy
is stalled in DRPLA mice and in human ﬁbroblasts
from patients of DRPLA.  This is evidenced by
accumulation of p62 and downregulation of LC3I/II conversion as well as reduced Tfeb expression. 
Chronic autophagy blockage in several conditions,
including DRPLA and Vici syndrome, an early-onset
autolysosomal pathology, leads to the activation of
alternative clearance pathways including Golgi
membrane-associated
nucleophagy-based
LaminB1 degradation and excretion.  The combination of these alternative pathways and canonical
autophagy blockade, results in dramatic nuclear
pathology with disruption of the nuclear organization, bringing about
terminal cell atrophy and
degeneration.  Thus, our ﬁndings identify a novel
progressive mechanism for the terminal phases of
neuronal cell degeneration and death in human
neurodegenerative diseases and provide a link beand
tween autophagy block, activation of alternative
pathways for degradation, and excretion of cellular
components. 
INTRODUCTION
Nuclear homeostasis has recently been the focus of attention in
aggregation-prone neurodegenerative disorders.  In particular,
defects in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and deregulation of nuclear matrix have been identiﬁed as potential pathomechanisms
in several conditions [1–4].  Mutation in genes encoding nuclear
lamina constituents have been associated with degradation of
nuclear components by autophagy [5], in a process further
deﬁned as nucleophagy. 
Autophagy affects onset and progression of several human
reﬂecting its key role as a
neurodegenerative diseases,
regulator of neuronal proteostasis and organelle quality control [6].  Bulk or selected cargos are recruited by autophagy
receptors, like p62, to forming double-membrane vesicles,
the autophagosomes, marked by the lipid-conjugated form
of LC3, LC3-II.  Mature autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes
to form autolysosomes where the cargo is digested by lysosomal enzymes and basic molecules are recycled back to
the cytoplasm [7].  Nucleophagy, a selective autophagy mechanism, has been linked to LaminB1 degradation through
direct interaction with LC3 as a mechanism of protection
from oncogenesis and of
toward cellular
senescence [8].  However, the importance of nucleophagy
and its relationship with neuronal degeneration has not
been established.

Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are neurological conditions due to an expanded CAG repeat resulting in polyQ
stretches in the encoded protein.  This family of disorders
includes Huntington’s disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian
atrophy (DRPLA), and several spinocerebellar ataxias.  DRPLA
is caused by the expansion of a CAG stretch in the

choreoathetoid symptoms as well as myoclonus, generalized
epilepsy, and dementia with extensive cellular degeneration

the dentate nucleus, DN) [10].
