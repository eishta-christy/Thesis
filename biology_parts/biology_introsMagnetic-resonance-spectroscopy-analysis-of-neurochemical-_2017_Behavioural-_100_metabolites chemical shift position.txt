Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder accompanied by cognitive decline [1].  The World
Alzheimer Report 2015 estimates that over 46 million people live with
dementia worldwide and the cost of dementia is $818 billion [2]. 
Furthermore, the prevalence of AD increases with ageing and doubles
every ﬁve years after the age of 65, which will cause great economic
and social burdens [2,3]. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
including structural MRI,
functional MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS),
is becoming more useful in the understanding of the pathogenesis and
diagnosis of AD [4–12].  Brain morphological abnormalities, such as
hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala have been gradually
uncovered with the development of structural MRI in the study of AD
patients [4,8,9].  Animal structural MRI also shows striatum and entorhinal cortex atrophy in AD models, including the TASTPM and APP/
PS2/Tau mouse [13].  In addition, 1H MRS studies have suggested that
neurochemical alterations, such as those associated with glutamate
(Glu) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the hippocampus or cingulate,
contribute to cognitive decline in AD patients [14–16].  In animal
models of AD, neurochemical alterations were measured similarly with
that of AD patients [17–19].  Glu is a primary excitatory neurotransmitter that is thought to represent the number of survival neurons
[20].  NAA is a speciﬁc kind of amino acids that mainly exists in the
neurons and axon [21].  As a neuronal marker, the concentration of

NAA can be sensitive to neuron density.  myo-inositol (mIn) is one of the
most abundant metabolites visible on 1H MRS in the brain and can act
as a biomarker of glial activation[22].  A number of studies suggest that
neurochemical alterations are associated with cognitive decline in AD
[18,21,23–25]. 
However, few studies have contemporarily focused on the roles of
structural MRI changes and neurochemical alterations in cognitive decline associated with AD.  Therefore, the current study aimed to measure the learning and memory ability and regional volumes in APP/PS1
transgenic mice.  Furthermore, some atrophic regions were selected as
region of interest (ROI) to explore neurochemical metabolism using 1H
MRS in order to further understand cognitive decline in AD.

2. 1.  Animals
Twelve-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice and age-matched littermate wild-type (C57Bl/6J) control mice were used for the water
maze, MRI and 1H MRS analyses, with 2 diﬀerent groups per test (n = 7
mice/group, weights 25–35 g).  APP/PS1 mice express a chimeric
mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a
mutanthuman presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9), which are associated with earlyonset AD [26]. 
All animals were kept in standard size mouse cages (29*18*13 cm,
up to 5 per same sex group) at 20–26 °C on a daily 12-h light-dark cycle
with ad libitum access to food and water.  All experiments were performed strictly in accordance with the International Ethical Guidelines
and National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Ethics Committee of
Fujian University of TCM, P. R.  China (protocol #FUTCM-2014012).  All
eﬀorts were made to minimize animal suﬀering. 
2. 2.  Morris water maze test
Cognitive function was tested using a water maze apparatus
(Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China), which was a stainless
steel circular tank with a diameter of 120 cm and a height of 50 cm.  The
tank was ﬁlled with water (21–23 °C) to a depth of 40 cm and divided
into four equal quadrants.  A platform (diameter, 6 cm) was placed in
the third quadrant and submerged 1 cm below the surface of the water. 
For the place navigation trials, mice were trained for ﬁve days.  Each
trial was started by placing the mice in one of the four quadrants.  Mice
were allowed to swim for a period of 90 s to ﬁnd the hidden platform.  If
a mouse did not ﬁnd the platform within 90 s, it was removed from the
water and placed on the platform for 15 s by a researcher.  On the sixth
day, the probe trial test was performed to assess memory consolidation
and the platform was removed.  Each mouse was allowed to swim freely
for 90 s.  The frequency of each mouse that crossed the position where
the platform was once placed and the time spent in the target quadrant
were recorded. 
2. 3.  MRI scanning
Prior to MRI scanning, mice were initially anaesthetized with 1. 5%
isoﬂurane in a 1:4 oxygen and air mixture.  During the MRI scan, the
animals were placed prone in a MR-compatible stereotactic holder with
the head cinched, the teeth hooked by a tooth bar, and the nose emplaced in a nose cone to exhaust isoﬂurane in a mixture of oxygen and
air (ratio 1:4).  The core body temperature was controlled to approximately 37 °C using a warm water circulated heating cradle, and respiration was monitored.  Imaging was performed on a 7T small animal
MRI scanner (70/20USR Biospec, Bruker Biospin GMbls, Germany).  The
body coil and surface coil were used as the exciting coil and receivingA 3D rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) T2weigheted sequence was performed to assess anatomic changes with the
following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 16000 ms, echo time
(TE) = 65 ms, number of averages = 16; ﬁeld of view (FOV)
= 20*20 mm,
thickness = 0. 2 mm and matrix = 256*256. 
slices = 75,2. 4.  Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of MRI data
All pre-processing was performed using Advanced Normalization
Tools (ANTs) [27] and Statistical Parametric Mapping8 (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Clinical Neurology, London) with the SPMMouse
plugin [28].  First,
the images were corrected for intensity nonhomogeneity with ANTs’s N4biasFieldCorrection [29].  Then, the brain
images were extracted from the corrected images by skull strip.  The
extracted brain images were normalized into the standard stereotactic
space [30] and segmented into grey matter (GM), white matter (WM)
and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) using SPMMouse toolbox [28].  Finally,
the resulting GM images were smoothed with a 210 μm isotropic
Gaussian kernel using SPM8.  The two-sample t-test was performed by
SPMMouse toolbox [28] voxel-by-voxel to determine the GM volume
diﬀerences within the whole brain between control and APP/PS1
transgenic mice.  P < 0. 01 and clusters > 50 voxels were considered as
the statistically signiﬁcant threshold. 
2. 5.  1H-MRS acquiring
Based on the results of the above VBM analysis, APP/PS1 transgenic
mice revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in volume of grey matter in the
hippocampus, motor cortex, amygdaloid body, striatum, etc.  The hippocampus is the area of most concern in AD studies.  A number of studies have shown regional atrophy in the hippocampus of AD [8,9]. 
Therefore, we selected an area in the hippocampus as the region of
interest (ROI) for 1H-MRS measurement, where a signiﬁcant reduction
in volume of grey matter was detected by VBM.  The ROI size was set as
1. 5*1. 5*1. 5 mm. 
TE = 35 ms,
A T2-weighted image using RARE sequence was ﬁrst acquired to
ensure the mouse head position.  The parameters were as follows:
TR = 4200 ms,
averages = 4,
FOV = 20*20 mm, slice thickness = 0. 5 mm, slices = 30, and matrix = 256*256.  The selected ROI was shimmed, and the water suppression pulse was adjusted for chemical-shift-water suppression
(CHESS) prior to the point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) acquisition.

2. 6.  1H-MRS spectral processing
The spectral data were processed using the software package
TOPSPIN (v3. 1, Bruker Biospin, Germany).  The areas under the peak
for various metabolites, including NAA, mIn, Glu and creatine (Cr),
were calculated automatically using a quantum estimation (QUEST)
method with a subtraction approach for background modelling.  Using
Cr as the criterion [18,31], NAA/Cr, Glu/Cr and mIn/Cr were statistically evaluated.  The metabolites chemical shift position in the brain,
including NAA 2. 02 parts per million (ppm), Glu 2.
