Public health messages delivered in video format are the mainstay
of smoking-cessation campaigns that have contributed to the decline in
smoking prevalence in the US (Woloshin, Schwartz, & Welch, 2008). 
Yet, despite these eﬀorts, smoking remains a leading cause of mortality
and morbidity worldwide, and is responsible for more than 480,000
deaths annually in the United States alone (U. S.  Department of Health
and Human Services, 2014).  Therefore, it is imperative to identify the
factors that inﬂuence audiences’ cognitive processing of smoking-cessation videos (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). 
Sensory features, which attract viewer’s attention through engaging visuals, edits, and music, have been hypothesized to be one such factor
(D’Silva and Palmgreen, 2007; Helme, Donohew, Baier, & Zittleman, 2007;
Morgan, Palmgreen, Stephenson, Hoyle, & Lorch, 2003).  Message sensation
value (MSV) is a validated measure that has been developed to quantify
such sensory features in health promotion videos (Morgan Name, 2003).  The
prevailing assumption that higher MSV improves cognitive processing and
eﬀectiveness of health promotion videos has been challenged by recent
neuroimaging studies, which found that videos with lower MSV were better
remembered and elicited greater prefrontal and temporal
response
(Langleben Name, 2009; Seelig Name, 2014).  These ﬁndings are consistent
with predictions of the limited cognitive capacity theories.  These theories
suggest that although high MSV attracts viewers’ attention, it also diverts
cognitive resources from processing the health information content in the
videos (Petty and Cacioppo, 1986; Wilson and Wolf, 2009). 
While these studies question the value of utilizing high MSV as an
eﬀective communication tool, they do not address the possibility that
individual diﬀerences in attention to sensory stimulation may be responsible for the lack of eﬀectiveness of high-MSV videos at a population level (Everett and Palmgreen, 1995; Stephenson and Palmgreen,
2001).  Such diﬀerences would have been of purely academic interest in
the era of network television, but as media becomes more personalized,
individual diﬀerences in the neurocognitive processing of health promotion videos begin to acquire real life relevance (Chua Name, 2011). 
Yet, experimental data on the biological basis of individual diﬀerences
in the cognitive processing of health messages are very limited.  Many
key traits that may aﬀect individual ability to process health messages,
such as selective attention, working memory and reward sensitivity, are
inﬂuenced by dopaminergic neurotransmission (Gordon, Devaney,
Bean, & , Vaidya, 2015).  The dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) has a
variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism that modulates
dopaminergic neurotransmission, with the 10-repeat (10R) and 9-repeat (9R) alleles as the most common forms (Mitchell Name, 2000).  The

10R/10R homozygosity has been linked to a higher level of novelty
seeking, a trait that indicates greater reactivity to novel external stimulation (Sabol Name, 1999).  The 10R allele has also been consistently
implicated in increased susceptibility to attention deﬁcit disorder
(ADD) (Cook Name, 1995; Gill, Daly, Heron, Hawi, & Fitzgerald, 1997;
Gizer, Ficks, & Waldman, 2009; Kebir, Tabbane, Sengupta, & Joober,
2009; Newman Name, 2014).  Although it remains unclear whether this
association is mediated by the dopamine or dopamine transporter levels
(Yang Name, 2007), it suggests that homozygous 10R allele carriers are
more likely than others to exhibit poor attentional processing, e. g. 
diﬃculty ﬁltering out irrelevant sensory stimuli, which is a key
symptom of ADD (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).  Therefore,
it is possible that when exposed to public health video messages with
high MSV, 10R DAT1 homozygotes would be more engaged by the attention-grabbing sensory features compared to carriers of other genotypes. 
The present study sought to examine the eﬀect of DAT1 polymorphism on the brain response to high MSV format.  The value of such
candidate gene approach is limited by the a priori assumptions about
the relationship between the gene and the phenotype (Tabor,
Risch, & Myers, 2002).  However, it remains useful as the practical approach to generate initial data on the eﬀects of individual genetic
makeup on the neurocognitive processing of public health communication in a small sample (Simon Name, 2011).  Such studies would help
to demonstrate the relevance of genetics to the processing of public
health video ads and to determine the feasibility of the larger and much
more expensive genome-wide association studies.  Building on the link
between the 10R DAT1 allele and attentional processing deﬁcits described above, we hypothesized that smokers with two copies of the
10R allele (10/10) would diﬀer from smokers without the 10R homozygosity (non-10/10) in the neural response to high-MSV smokingcessation videos.  Speciﬁcally, we hypothesized that the 10/10 smokers
would show greater neural response to high-MSV vs.  low-MSV videos
than the non-10/10 smokers in two brain regions: the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
(rVLPFC).  These regions form the strongly right lateralized “ventral
attention network” that underlies bottom-up, stimulus-driven attentional processing (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Fox, Corbetta, Snyder,
Vincent, & Raichle, 2006; Petersen and Posner, 2012; Vossel,
Geng, & Fink, 2014), and are thus likely to be modulated by the greater
attention-grabbing sensory content in high-MSV videos.  The secondary
aim of the present study was to explore the contribution of the diﬀerences between 10/10 and non-10/10 smokers’ ventral attention network response during one-time exposure to smoking-cessation videos to
individual variation in future smoking behavior.  Smoking was indexedSchoﬁeld-Hurwitz, Hardt,
Levasseur, & Tremblay,Brody, & Benowitz, 1990) and objective (urine levels of the nicotine
metabolite cotinine) measures of smoking (Pokorski, Chen, & Bertholf,
1994; Wall, Johnson, Jacob, & Benowitz, 1988), immediately before
and approximately one month after the one-time exposure to 16
smoking-cessation videos.

2. 1.  Participants
Seventy-four non-treatment-seeking adult daily smokers participated in the study.  Eight participants were excluded due to excessive
(>1 voxel) head motion during the MRI scan and 15 participants declined to be genotyped, leaving 53 participants (23 female; 3 lefthanded) who passed MRI quality control and were genotyped. 
Participants reported their racial-ethnic characteristics as follows: 28
White, 19 African American, 4 Asian, and 2 Hispanic.  Their ages ranged(M ± SE = 31. 34 ± 1. 33), with
14. 16 ± 0. 26 years of education.  All participants gave writtenand49
informed consent to participate in the protocol approved by the
University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.  Exclusion criteria were (1) presence of any DSM-IV-TR Axis 1 psychiatric disorder
except tobacco use disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2000);
(2) urine drug screen positive for illicit opioids, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, or methamphetamine; (3) baseline urinary cotinine
levels <50 ng/ml (SRNT Subcommittee on Biochemical Veriﬁcation,
2002); (4) presence of medical or neurological disorder or treatment
that may aﬀect the cerebrovascular system; and (5) safety-related
contraindications for MRI scanning. 
2. 2.  Task
The video-viewing task is described in the Supplementary materials
and in Wang Name (2013).  Each participant viewed eight smokingcessation videos with Low MSV and eight with High MSV in a random
order, separated by a 16 s rest period (gray cross-hair on a homogenous
black background).  A 16 s rest period was also presented at the beginning of the task.  Each video was 30 s long and presented only once. 
2. 3.  Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from anti-coagulated venous blood
samples using a standard salting out method (Lahiri and Nurnberger,
1991).  Genotyping of
the DAT1 40 bp repeat polymorphism
(rs28363170) was performed as previously described (Franklin Name,
2009; Vandenbergh Name, 1992) (see Supplementary material).  Participants were divided into two cohorts by the DAT1 genotype: 26
homozygous (two copies) for the 10-repeat allele, and 27 with one or no
10R alleles (21 with 10R/9R, 2 with 9R/8R, and 1 each with 10R/8R,
9R/9R, and 3R/3R). 
2. 4.  Procedure
The study included a phone screening, baseline assessment, fMRI
session, and a follow-up session 1 month later.  Participants were asked
to avoid nicotine-replacement products throughout the study and to
report any use of such products.  At the baseline session, participants
were evaluated for eligibility, demographics, and handedness (Oldﬁeld,
1971).  One hour before the fMRI session, participants provided urine
samples for baseline cotinine levels, reported the average number of
cigarettes smoked per day in the past 30 days, and completed the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) (Heatherton, Kozlowski,
Frecker, & Fagerstrom, 1991) and other behavioral assessments (see
Supplementary material).  Approximately 30–45 min before the fMRI
session, participants were given an opportunity to smoke one of their
own cigarettes outdoors under observation.
