Is Friday ‘right’ and Monday ‘left’? Some individuals experience vivid
spatial forms for non-numerical sequences such as the weekdays, and most
would agree on a left-to-right arrangement, at least in Western societies
reading from left-to-right.  In fact, psychological experiments show that the
cognitive representation of sequence includes a spatial component: In
natural sequences such as numbers, months and weekdays (Dehaene,
Bossini, & Giraux, 1993; Gevers, Reynvoet, & Fias, 2003; Gevers,
Reynvoet, & Fias, 2004), but also in just rehearsed artiﬁcial sequences of
random numbers or objects (van Dijck & Fias, 2011), the primary/ﬁnal
items are mentally arranged to the left/right by healthy participants and
corresponding left-hand and right-hand responses are relatively faster in
simple classiﬁcation tasks.  Seeing these resembling behavioral patterns, a
concise theory could assume that the same neurocognitive process underlies the tendency to project all enumerable objects mentally onto space. 
The SNARC eﬀect (spatial-numerical associations of response codes)
oﬀers a reliable and insightful testbed for exploring spatial associations
and the eﬀect was originally observed in judgments of numerical symbols. 
Numerous studies replicated its central ﬁnding of relatively faster left-side
than right-side responding to smaller numbers, and vice versa for larger
numbers (Dehaene Name, 1993; see Wood, Willmes, Nuerk, & Fischer,
2008 for a meta-analysis).  Originally, the SNARC eﬀect was understood as
a long-term spatial representation of numerical magnitude resembling a
mental number line (Pinel, Piazza, Bihan, & Dehaene, 2004; Restle, 1970). 
However, this classical account would assume that a distinct spatial

representations
in the SNARC eﬀect
Notably, although SNARC and SNARC-like eﬀects were documented
for both numerical and non-numerical sequences (Dehaene Name, 1993;
Fias, Brysbaert, Geypens, & D’Ydewalle, 1996; Gevers Name, 2004), sequences such as the weekdays expose a clear ordinal structure with additional cyclic component (Zamarian, Egger, & Delazer, 2007) whereas the
number sequence includes mixed ordinal and cardinal magnitude features. 
For instance, the single-digit ‘2’ could refer to the second item in a row
(ordinality), but the same digit ‘2’ could also imply twice the amount of
something (cardinality).  In contrast, ‘Tuesday’ only refers to the second
day of the week and never implies the summed-up amount of two days.  A
conceptual controversy among numerical cognition researchers regards
therefore the distinction between number magnitude and sequential order
information (e. g. , Fitousi, 2010) and their respective roles in forming(e. g. , Nathan, Shaki,
Salti, & Algom, 2009).  A potentially unifying account was recently promoted by experimentally disentangling the cardinal and ordinal properties
of number: In a delayed working memory (WM) paradigm, participants
were asked to maintain randomized number sequences (e. g. , 4-1-6-8-3)
and performed a SNARC task on the memorized numbers in a delay
period.  In this experiment (and in several follow-up studies), it turned out
that spatial-numerical associations were based on the sequential order and
not on the semantic magnitude information of the numbers (van Dijck,
Abrahamse, Acar, Ketels, & Fias, 2014; van Dijck & Fias, 2011).  This
ﬁnding led to the WM account of the SNARC eﬀect: Here, numbers are
thought to elicit spontaneous adaptations of a general cognitive process to
arrange the present sequence with a spatial layout at the level of WM to
temporarily built an eﬀective (spatial) mental representation (Abrahamse,
van Dijck, & Fias, 2016).  The important contribution of verbal WM to the
SNARC eﬀect was highlighted even before in diﬀerent studies that showed
reversals of SNARC eﬀects by verbal labels positioned at physically incompatible locations (Gevers, Verguts, Reynvoet, Caessens, & Fias, 2006;
Gevers Name, 2010).  Moreover, compatibility eﬀects were observed between the parity concept and spatial responding in the MARC eﬀect
(Berch, Foley, Hill, & Ryan, 1999; Iversen, Nuerk, Jäger, & Willmes, 2006;
Iversen, Nuerk, & Willmes, 2004; Nuerk,
Iversen, & Willmes, 2004;
Schroeder & Pﬁster, 2015).  The assumption of the MARC eﬀect is based on
the principle of markedness: Linguistically, there is a default member in
opposite pairs which is deﬁned by semantic, distributional, or formal
characteristics.  If a classiﬁcation involves stimulus and response features
that share their markedness status, this can lead to faster performance than
when one feature is marked and the other is not.  This behavior can also
account for the standard numerical SNARC eﬀect because response features and verbal magnitude categorization share the marked members
(small-left) or unmarked linguistic members (large-right) in compatible
trials, which usually yield faster responses than incompatible trials.  In less
detail, the verbally mediated categorical correspondence principle is also
compatible with the proposal of polarity correspondence (Proctor & Cho,
2006) and the involvement of verbal circuits for magnitude processing
(Dehaene, Piazza, Pinel, & Cohen, 2003). 
Regarding the underlying functional neuroanatomy, the uniﬁed
theory also invites shifting the focus from the parietal regions bolstering
numerical representations and operations (Cohen Kadosh & Walsh,
2009; Dehaene Name, 2003; Piazza, Pinel, Le Bihan, & Dehaene, 2007)
to prefrontal cortex regions and their contributions to the processing of
sequential order (Marshuetz, Smith, Jonides, DeGutis, & Chenevert,
2000; Shimamura, Janowsky, & Squire, 1990), most likely in conjunction with distributed WM systems (Baddeley, 2000; D’Esposito & Postle,
2015; Hurlstone, Hitch, & Baddeley, 2014).  Furthermore, previous research identiﬁed especially frontoparietal networks for abstract quantity representations in non-human primates, possibly along a hierarchical gradient (Nieder, 2016; Tudusciuc & Nieder, 2009).  Prefrontal
activations were also often found in early neuroimaging studies of
number processing; however, they were often interpreted as subserving
only or predominantly non-numerical processes and were thus not (orless) considered in neurofunctional models (e. g. , Dehaene Name, 2003). 
Disruption of the frontoparietal number circuits in human participants
with transcranial magnetic stimulation over right frontal eye ﬁeld and
inferior frontal gyrus, but not over parietal regions, reduced spatialnumerical associations (Rusconi, Dervinis, Verbruggen, & Chambers,
2013).  Furthermore, functional and structural connectivities between
neuroanatomically distinct frontal and parietal areas corroborate verbal
and non-verbal processing of numerical magnitude (Klein Name, 2016). 
By administering transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the
left prefrontal cortex, we recently demonstrated polarity-dependent modulations of SNARC eﬀects in a sham-controlled setting (Schroeder, Pﬁster,
Kunde, Nuerk, & Plewnia, 2016).  Originally, this tDCS conﬁguration was
motivated by the possibility to modulate WM processes with cathodal tDCS
(e. g. , Wolkenstein, Zeiller, Kanske, & Plewnia, 2014; Zaehle, Sandmann,
Thorne, Jäncke, & Herrmann, 2011), and a recent publication demonstrated
the selectivity of left-hemispheric tDCS on a verbal letter n-back WM tasks
and right-hemispheric tDCS on a visuospatial n-back task (Ruf,
Fallgatter, & Plewnia, 2017).  Similar modulations of number processing by
prefrontal tDCS were also observed in number bisection and clock drawing
tasks (Arshad Name, 2016).  Transcranial brain stimulation with tDCS directs
weak currents in the range of 1–2 mA to targeted brain regions and its
eﬀects are best deﬁned by the current polarity, which produces predominant excitation underneath the ‘anodal’ electrode and inhibition underneath the ‘cathodal’ electrode (Nitsche & Paulus, 2000).  The eﬀects of
tDCS are thought
to depend on the current network activity
(Fertonani & Miniussi, 2016), as neural structures are not entirely blocked,
but resting membrane potentials are shifted and thus ﬁring thresholds are
reduced (anodal tDCS) or increased (cathodal tDCS).  However, cathodal
tDCS can also modulate resting-state connectivity (Keeser Name, 2011) and
engagement of task-speciﬁc fronto-parietal networks in arithmetic processing (Hauser Name, 2016) and in verbal ﬂuency (Ehlis, Haeussinger, Gastel,
Fallgatter, & Plewnia, 2015).  Thus, the method is ideally suited to modulate
SNARC-related network activity, including left-hemispheric verbal WM
(Gevers Name, 2010; van Dijck & Fias, 2011).  Nevertheless, it is mandatory
to highlight that the mechanisms of tDCS are not yet clearly understood and
its eﬃcacy is rather controversial (Horvath, Forte, & Carter, 2015).  In behavioral tasks, it should be further acknowledged that internal consistency
and test-retest reliability for reaction time measurements can be fairly low
[e. g. , r1/2 = . 698 for SNARC regression slopes (Cipora & Nuerk, 2013)]. 
Finally, behavioral eﬀects of tDCS can be observed best when a task implies
a targeted region, and stimulation eﬀects were most pronounced for the
most active task instructions (Gill, Shah-basak, & Hamilton, 2015; Zwissler
Name, 2014). 
In separate experiments involving parity and magnitude judgment,
we recently observed a reduction of SNARC eﬀects by cathodal tDCS to
the left prefrontal cortex (Schroeder Name, 2016).  However, the mere
correspondence between WM-implied areas and neuromodulation results only provided suggestive evidence for a WM account of the SNARC
eﬀect, and alternative explanations such as a modulation of subthreshold conﬂict detection processes still required further empirical validation (Schroeder Name, 2016).  Moreover, the tested single-digit stimuli
could not diﬀerentiate whether the modulation of SNARC eﬀects by
prefrontal tDCS depended on numerical magnitude or sequential order
information, because numbers convey simultaneous ordinal and cardinal magnitude information, as noted above.  However, the uniﬁed
ordinal WM account would predict comparable behavioral changes
from the same manipulation of neurocognitive activity in both ordinal,
non-numerical sequences as well as in cardinal, numerical sequences
with magnitude information. 
Thus, following up on the previously reported eﬀects of tDCS on
spatial-numerical processing (Arshad Name, 2016; Schroeder Name,
2016), the current study set out to also investigate modulations of the
spatial associations of a non-numerical sequence by the identical lefthemispheric prefrontal tDCS conﬁguration.  More precisely, to address
whether the same neurocognitive mechanism is involved in mentally
aligning numerical and non-numerical sequences spatially, we tested

two groups of healthy participants before and concurrent to anodal or
cathodal tDCS in a series of classiﬁcation tasks.  From the previous results, we expected that the stimulation would attenuate (cathodal
group) or emphasize (anodal group) the associations between space and
sequence positions for a single-digit numerical sequence (1–5) and we
expected the same behavior for a non-numerical weekday sequence
(Monday-Friday).  Thus, the design tested the presence of a generalized
neurocognitive mechanism that would predict similar stimulation effects from the spontaneous arrangement of order along a spatial template. 
In a separate control experiment conducted in the same participants on
the same testing day, we also asked whether stimulation eﬀects could
persist even in cases where the target concept (e. g. , numerical or non-numerical sequence) is only weakly activated.  We therefore tested participants’ performance with the same stimuli on a task variant that does not
require active processing of the sequence (font color classiﬁcation).  In the
order-irrelevant tasks, SNARC-like eﬀects are less substantial (Gevers Name,
2003, 2004) or even abolished due to involvement of SNARC-irrelevant
neural circuits in color classiﬁcation (Fias, Lauwereyns, & Lammertyn,
2001).  Thus, given that sequence information is here available to somewhat
smaller extents, this task variant tested the possibility of subthreshold detection modulations (Schroeder Name, 2016) as opposed to the state dependency principle of tDCS (Gill Name, 2015; Zwissler Name, 2014).  The
subthreshold detection hypothesis would anticipate greater neuromodulation eﬀects in the color judgment tasks in the sense that a response conﬂict
between the spatial code extracted from numerical/ordinal information and
spatial responding would become behaviorally relevant only concurrent to
tDCS when capacities are enhanced, but the state dependency principle
would anticipate greater neuromodulation eﬀects in the order-relevant
judgment tasks. 
The main prediction, however, was that the relatively faster lefthand responses for small and early items and relatively faster righthand responses for large and late items would assemble substantial
SNARC eﬀects in both groups and both tested sequences during the
baseline measurement.  Moreover, in line with a uniﬁed account of the
SNARC eﬀect, we hypothesized that this link between space and order
would become less pronounced during cathodal tDCS and stronger
during anodal tDCS irrespective of the tested sequence.

2. 1.  Participants
Forty-eight healthy right-handed participants were tested twice,
before (baseline performance) and during 1 mA tDCS (stimulation
performance) either with anodal polarity (n = 24; mean age: 22. 4 y,
range: 18–30 y, 4 male) or with cathodal polarity (n = 24; mean age:
23. 0 y, range: 18–27 y, 5 male).  The two groups were matched in terms
of age, p = . 463, gender, p = . 719, handedness score, p = . 726, years
of education, p = . 381 (mean: 16. 17 y, range: 12. 5–22 y), and verbal
intelligence, p = 721 (assessed with a brief German vocabulary test;
Lehrl, 2005).  All participants gave written informed consent and received monetary compensation or course credits for their attendance. 
Ethical agreement was obtained from University Hospital Tuebingen
Ethical Commision (NO: 701/2015BO2).  Participants were eligible for
the study if they were native German speakers without neurological or
psychiatric impairment (explicitly including epilepsy, developmental
disorders, as well as synesthesia and color blindness), and if they
complied with safety regulation (no metallic implants, pregnancy,
medication or use of recreational drugs, cardiac pacemaker, according
to participant self-reports). 
2. 2.  Procedure
Participants were randomly assigned to the anodal or cathodal tDCS
group.  Except for the administered stimulation polarity, all procedures for
the two groups were identical.  All participants completed both the orderrelevant experiment as well as the order-irrelevant control experiment. 
After completion of the baseline performance phase, participants completed an unrelated cognitive test (beads task), rated their mood (Watson,
Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) and were equipped with tDCS.  A resting phase of
5 min after stimulation onset preceded repeated testing of SNARC and
SNARC-like eﬀects with numerical and non-numerical sequences in orderrelevant comparison tasks and also in order-irrelevant classiﬁcation tasks
(control experiment).  Participants from both groups (anodal and cathodal)
completed all tasks in both experiments.  The orders of experiments and
tasks within experiments were counterbalanced across participants.  In the
order-relevant experiment, participants had to decide whether a weekday
came before or after ‘Wednesday’ (ordinal sequence) or whether a number
was smaller or greater than the referent ‘3’ (cardinal sequence).  Two
keyboard buttons (covert ‘s’ and ‘l’ on a QWERTZ-keyboard) were operated by left-hand and right-hand index ﬁnger presses and response-mappings were switched within the tasks in counterbalanced order across
participants.  In the control experiment, the task was to indicate font colors
by left-hand or right-hand index ﬁnger key presses and to ignore in separate blocks weekday names (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday),
number symbols (1, 2, 4, 5), and color words in a control Stroop task (blue,
green) that was included to assess automatic color-word interference and
possible tDCS modulations of executive functions (Stroop, 1935).  The
same weekday and number stimuli appeared in both order-relevant and
order-irrelevant experiments. 
All single tasks were preceded by a brief training block (16 trials) and
an error count emphasized correct responding.  Corresponding to previous
studies with weekday stimuli (Gevers Name, 2004), the experimental
procedure comprised 20 target repetitions in each task, with 300 ms
ﬁxation hash (#), 2 s target presentation (or until response), and 300 ms
error feedback (German words ‘Fehler’ [error] or ‘Bitte schneller antworten’ [please respond faster]) or a blank inter-trial interval. 
2. 3.  Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)Fallgatter, & Plewnia,
Direct current was generated by a CE-certiﬁed stimulator (DCSTIMULATOR MC, NeuroConn, Ilmenau, Germany).  The active electrode
(anode or cathode in the respective groups) was placed over the left PFC
(F3), the return electrode was ﬁxed to the right upper arm (Schroeder,
Ehlis, Wolkenstein,
Vandermeeren,
Jamart, & Ossemann, 2010; Wolkenstein & Plewnia, 2013; Zwissler Name,
2014).  Both 5 × 7 cm rubber electrodes were covered with adhesive paste
(10/20 conductive EEG paste, Kappamedical, USA) and impedances were
kept below 10 kΩ.  1 mA direct current was faded in with a 5 s ramp and a
5 min idle time preceded task initiation, with a stimulation duration of
25 min.  Participants were told to relax during the idle time before the task
and the experimenter announced the beginning of classiﬁcation tasks with
initiation of written instructions on the computer screen.  Fig.  1 displays a
current ﬂow model with standard conductivity values of the used electrode montage (Thielscher, Antunes, & Saturnino, 2015), which emphasizes a relatively dense ﬁeld in lateral PFC, but not in parietal regions.  In
the stimulation phase, all tasks were completed concurrent to active tDCS. 
Participants rated adverse eﬀects (Brunoni Name, 2011) as well as mood
(Watson Name, 1988) after completion of the stimulation protocol.  Stimulation polarity (anodal, cathodal) was randomly assigned and balanced
across participants to create equally sized groups. 
2. 4.  Data treatment
The current data were collected as part of a larger project on the
cognitive foundations of numerical and non-numerical spatial associations.  Results from the baseline sessions are also reported in another
paper which examines in greater detail individual diﬀerences, psychometric properties, and construct validity of diﬀerent spatial associations
(Schroeder, Nuerk, & Plewnia, in press).  The eﬀects of tDCS are analysed for the ﬁrst time in the current manuscript. P. A.  Schroeder Name

Fig.  1.  Electric ﬁeld model of the investigated tDCS conﬁguration.  The ﬁrst column depicts the placement of target electrode (anode/cathode dependent on group assignment), the second
and third column display the standard ﬁnite element head model and current density computations.  Finally, in column 4, current density values above three regions of interest
(dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC], inferior frontal gyrus [IFG], intraparietal sulcus [IPS]) were probed and cross-validated using SIMNIBS and COMETS toolboxes (Jung, Kim, & Im,
2013; Opitz, Paulus, Will, Antunes, & Thielscher, 2015). 
SNARC and SNARC-like eﬀects are indicated by an interaction
(ANOVA) of the repeated measures factors hand (left hand, right hand)
and position (which corresponds to increasing magnitudes in number stimuli: 1,2,4,5; weekdays: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday), as recommended by Tzelgov, Zohar-Shai, and Nuerk (2013).  The repeated
measures factor set (numbers, weekdays) was further introduced to differentiate numerical and non-numerical sequence items.  Polarity-dependent eﬀects of the stimulation denoted the factor combination of time
(baseline performance, stimulation performance) with the inter-subjects
factor tDCS polarity (anodal, cathodal).  For brevity, we refer to these
critical two-way interactions as SNARC (position × hand) and stimulation
(polarity x time). 
In a second step, as recommended in SNARC research, individual regression coeﬃcients were extracted for a quantiﬁcation of SNARC eﬀects,
and for follow-up tests of its modulations by prefrontal tDCS, following the
method introduced by Lorch and Myers (1990).  To that end, responsehand latency diﬀerences (dRT = left hand–right hand) were regressed on
the individual sequence positions (see Fig.  2).  From this procedure, a
single negative coeﬃcient signals the typical mapping of numbers and
weekdays onto space: With increasing sequence position, right-hand responses become relatively faster than left-hand responses.  We ran LSD
simple eﬀects interaction analyses and student’s t-tests to isolate signiﬁcant
results of ANOVA on these regression coeﬃcients. 
Finally, in the order-irrelevant control experiment, we additionally
report modulations in the Stroop task in terms of a repeated measures
ANOVA comprising the factor Stroop (compatible, incompatible) and
the factor stimulation (considered as the interaction term between stimulation polarity and time, as above).  Trials in the Stroop task were
regarded compatible if font color and written color were identical. 
We considered only correct responses for response times analyses
(94. 4% of all trials) and latencies deviating more than 3SDs of the corresponding cell mean were discarded as outliers (1. 7%).  Greenhouse-Geisser
corrected df- and p-values are reported upon violations of sphericity. 
3.  Results
3. 1.  Stimulation adverse eﬀects and mood
Common and moderate sensations of tingling and discomfort at
stimulation sites were reported, but there were no signiﬁcant polaritydiﬀerences (ps > . 48).  Detailed adverse eﬀect ratings from both experiments are reported in Table 1.  Positive and negative aﬀect were not
signiﬁcantly modulated by stimulation, Fs(1,46) < 1, ps > . 33. 
3. 2.  Order-relevant magnitude classiﬁcation tasks
3. 2. 1.  ANOVA
In the order-relevant comparison tasks, the anticipated two-way
interaction between hand and position – indicating the presence of
SNARC eﬀects – was signiﬁcant, F(2. 14,138) = 10. 55, p < . 001,
ηp2 = 0. 19.  The main eﬀect of time was signiﬁcant F(1,46) = 24. 73,
p < . 001, ηp2 = 0. 35, and mean responses were faster during anodal
or cathodal tDCS (523 ms) than in the preceding baseline session
(543 ms), but this was irrespective of stimulation polarity as rated by
the absence of signiﬁcance in the time × polarity interaction, F
(1,46) < 0. 01, p = . 950.  In line with general eﬀects of word length
and familiarity (e. g. , Gernsbacher, 1984), we observed generally faster
responses to numerical symbols (502 ms) than to letter strings (563 ms)
in a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of set, F(1,46) = 242. 55, p < . 001,
ηp2 = 0. 84.  This observation is in line with previous within-participant
designs that also found much faster responses (42ms–87 ms) for Arabic
number symbols (Nuerk Name, 2004; Nuerk, Wood, & Willmes, 2005). 
Most importantly, a ﬁve-way interaction of set with hand x position
(henceforth: SNARC) and with time x polarity (henceforth: stimulation)
was signiﬁcant, F(2. 27,138) = 5. 66, p = . 003, ηp2 = 0. 11.  This result
points to diﬀerential modulations of spatial associations in weekday
and number sequences by prefrontal tDCS.  To more precisely interpret
the eﬀect of tDCS, we next quantiﬁed the obtained SNARC eﬀects by
linear regressions for the diﬀerent tasks and stimulation conditions. 
Since response hand diﬀerences are aggregated in SNARC slopes, we
also checked in the ANOVA whether there was a more basic modulation
of hand by tDCS.  At least one study suggested such modulations to result from tDCS over sensorimotor cortex (Minarik Name, 2016).
