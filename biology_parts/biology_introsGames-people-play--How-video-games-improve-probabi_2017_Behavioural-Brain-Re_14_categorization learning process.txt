Probabilistic categorization learning requires a coordinated interaction between declarative and non-declarative memory.  Over the past
20 years, evidence has accumulated that probabilistic learning involves
distinct anatomically and functionally segregated memory systems [1]. 
It has been discussed whether these systems interact in a competitive
[2,3] or cooperative manner [4].  Brain regions which are involved in
cognitive control, performance integration and reward learning [5–9]
represent additional factors aﬀecting the probabilistic categorization
learning process.  With respect to memory, the interplay of the medial
temporal lobe [MTL] and the basal ganglia is in the focus of research
[2].  Declarative memory involves the hippocampus which supports the
acquisition of ﬂexible knowledge in contrast to more rigid striatumdependent memory systems [10,11]. 
The weather prediction task (WPT) is a well-known probabilistic
learning task [5–7,2].  In this task, participants are asked to classify one
to three (out of four) diﬀerent cue cards into one of two weather categories (rain or sun) based on feedback they receive for their actions. 
The WPT is a well-established probabilistic categorization learning task
that demonstrates the diﬀerential contributions of declarative (mediated by the hippocampus) and nondeclarative (mediated by the basal
ganglia) memory processes [12].  Patients with basal ganglia disorders
show reduced performances in the WPT, especially in the early probabilistic learning phase [5].  However, amnesic patients with damage to
the hippocampus perform comparably to controls in the early phases of
learning, presumably because the declarative memory system interferes
with the nondeclarative regularities detected by the nondeclarative
memory system [6]. 
Additionally, further studies focused on the contribution of declarative knowledge to WPT performance [8,13,9,14].  Schwabe and
Wolf [9], for instance, demonstrated a positive correlation between
WPT task performance and hippocampal activation.  It seems that the
hippocampus-based learning and the hippocampal activity play an
important role in the categorization learning process and support the
learning performance in a probabilistic learning task. 
The hippocampal activity as well as the hippocampal based memory
processing and hippocampal based behavior can be in turn modiﬁed by
