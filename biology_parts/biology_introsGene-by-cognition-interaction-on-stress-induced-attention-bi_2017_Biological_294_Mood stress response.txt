Weight gain and obesity are a great health concern of the modern
Western world, in both Europe (Berghöfer Name, 2008) and the US
(Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, & Curtin, 2010) obesity has reached a prevalence of 30%.  Emotional eating, which is overeating during stress or
negative aﬀect seems to be an important factor in weight gain while it
increases food intake of speciﬁcally high fat and/or sweet foods
(Gibson, 2012; Greeno & Wing, 1994; Schepers & Markus, 2015).  The
cause of this unhealthy habit has not decisively been determined, although over the last years in both cognitive and biological scientiﬁc
ﬁelds this topic has been explored extensively.  For instance diﬀerences
in behavioral disinhibition (Guerrieri Name, 2007), attention bias
(Shafran, Lee, Cooper, Palmer, & Fairburn, 2007), restrained eating
styles (Greeno & Wing, 1994), heightened responses of reward areas of
the brain towards food related cues (Bohon, Stice, & Spoor, 2009) and
genetics (Keskitalo Name, 2008; Sung, Lee, Song, Lee, & Lee, 2010;
Tholin, Rasmussen, Tynelius, & Karlsson, 2005) all seem to partly explain emotional eating.  A system that is greatly involved in stress
resilience and therefore might play an important part in emotional
eating is the brain serotonergic (5-HT) system.  Dysfunction of this
neurotransmitter is associated with decreased stress resilience and increased intake of carbohydrate rich foods (Markus, 2008).  The serotonin transporter gene contains a polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) that inﬂuences availability of serotonin transporters thereby inﬂuencing 5-HT
eﬃcacy.  Carrying an S-allele of this gene (opposed to an L-allele) causes
increased hormonal and behavioral stress responsiveness (Gotlib,
Joormann, Minor, & Hallmayer, 2008; Markus & De Raedt, 2011;
Markus & Firk, 2009; Mueller, Brocke, Fries, Lesch, & Kirschbaum,
2010), greater brain responses to fearful stimuli (Hariri & Holmes,
2006; Murphy Name, 2013) and increased chances of aﬀective disorders
in response to stressful life events (Karg, Burmeister, Shedden, & Sen,
2011; Miller, Wankerl, Stalder, Kirschbaum, & Alexander, 2013).  There
is indirect support for this gene’s inﬂuence on emotional eating as an Sallele is associated with overweight and obesity (Erritzoe Name, 2010;
Sookoian Name, 2007) and also seems to mediate the eﬀect of stressful
events on the incidence of eating disorders (Di Bella, Catalano,
Cavallini, Riboldi, & Bellodi, 2000; Fumeron Name, 2001).  However

direct associations between this allele and bodyweight are not always
reproduced (Hinney Name, 1997; Racine, Culbert, Larson, & Klump,
2009; Sundaramurthy, Pieri, Gape, Markham, & Campbell, 2000), suggesting that its role in emotional eating is more contributing than deterministic.  Ancillary to brain 5-HT function, stress vulnerability also
depends on cognitive evaluation of
stressful events
(Folkman & Lazarus, 1988).  A possible important interacting cognitive
factor in 5-HTTLPR’s eﬀect on emotional eating is neuroticism.  Neuroticism is a personality trait that inﬂuences the frequency and intensity(Kendler, Kuhn, & Prescott, 2004;
Luteijn & Bouman, 1988).  This cognitive stress vulnerability seems to
play a role in the eﬀect of 5-HTTLPR on eating behavior while particularly S/S-carriers who score high on neuroticism show an increased
body mass index (BMI) (Markus & Capello, 2012).  However a 5-HTTLPR by neuroticism interaction on food intake could not be found in
response to a natural (Capello & Markus, 2014a) or experimental
(Capello & Markus, 2014b) stressor.  These data suggest that neuroticism
does not directly inﬂuence the eﬀect of 5-HTTLPR on eating behavior,
however it might play a role through promoting a ruminative thinking
style (Lam, Smith, Checkley, Rijsdijk, & Sham, 2003; Watkins, 2008). 
Ruminative thinking is often deﬁned as (uncontrollable) perseverative
thinking about past or present negative events (Nolen-Hoeksema,
Wisco, & Lyubomirsky, 2008), even prolonging the biological stress
response as the body remains in a state of elevated levels of stress
hormones
stressor has disappeared
(Zoccola & Dickerson, 2012).  Consequently rumination is an important
factor in depression (Rood, Roelofs, B & gels, & Alloy, 2010) and eating
disorders (Birmingham & Firoz, 2006), is a solid predictor for negative
aﬀect in healthy subjects (Roelofs, Huibers, Peeters, Arntz, & van Os,
2008) and is even found to mediate the eﬀect of daily stress on food
intake among obese adults (Kubiak, V & gele, Siering, Schiel, & Weber,
2008).  Recent insights propose that a speciﬁc combination of high ruminative thinking and carrying an S-allele of 5-HTTLPR might increase
rewarding eﬀects of high caloric palatable foods and hence, the risk of
emotional eating (Schepers & Markus, 2015).  The aim of the current
study was to test whether this proposed increased risk of emotional
eating among high ruminative S-carriers is reﬂected in an increased
attention bias for high palatable foods during stress. 
(cortisol)longEmotional eating usually is accompanied by a preference for high
caloric sweet and/or fat foods (for a review see: Schepers & Markus,
2015), consumption of speciﬁcally these food types are associated with
activation of reward areas in the brain (Berridge, 1996; Small, JonesGotman, & Dagher, 2003).  Interestingly, seeing stimuli that are associated with reward when consumed can also already activate the brain
reward areas, thereby drawing attention towards these stimuli and
possibly induce craving (Carter & Tiﬀany, 1999).  These so called ‘attentional biases’ have been found for multiple types of drugs, for instance: caﬀeine (Yeomans, Javaherian, Tovey, & Staﬀord, 2005), tobacco(Townshend & Duka, 2001) and opiates
(Lubman, Peters, Mogg,
Bradley, & Deakin, 2000), but also for food cues, for instance particularly obese individuals show heightened vigilance for food related visual cues (Castellanos Name, 2009; Werthmann Name, 2011) and healthy
women were found to show an increased attention for food cues and
appetite after negative mood (Hepworth, Mogg, Brignell, & Bradley,Hudson, & Mogg,
(Bradley,2007),
Based on these ﬁndings our aim was to examine the combined inﬂuence of 5-HTTLPR genotype and ruminative thinking on visual attention for food cues during acute stress.  From a large genotype database (N = 827), 97 homozygous S’-and L’-allele carriers with either
high or low scores on a ruminative thinking scale were recruited and
tested for visual attention for food cues using an eye-tracking paradigm
before and after an acute laboratory stressor.  We expected that high
ruminative S’-carriers would show increased stress responsiveness and
thereby, show a greater attentional bias for high fat/sweet foods during<Middle> Methods. 
2. 1.  Participants
Potential participants were selected from an existing DNA database
(see: Schepers & Markus, 2017) containing 827 university students from
University Maastricht, genotyped for 5-HTTLPR and screened for factors including general health (weight and length, smoking and drinking
habits, personal or family history of psychiatric disorders) and ruminative thinking (ERRI intrusive scale, see section Materials).  For the
current study only homozygous carriers of 5-HTTLPR were invited,
because diﬀerences in stress responses are more pronounced within
these groups then within heterogynous groups (Way & Taylor, 2010). 
Participants were also selected based on ruminative thinking, only including participants with scores in the extreme percentiles, participants
with aﬀective and/or eating related disorders were excluded.  In total
221 students were invited for participation of which 97 (females/
males) responded.  Among these participants were 47 S/S-carriers (28
low ruminators, 19 high ruminators) and 50 L/L carriers (23 low ruminators, 27 high ruminators).  These participants were between 18 and
45 years of age (M = 20. 73, Sd = 3. 36) and their BMI ranged from 17
to 27 (M = 22. 25, Sd = 2. 30), see Table 1 for participant demographics.  A total of 10 participants were removed for analysis because
of: failed eye tracker calibrations (N = 5), reports of feeling ill on the
test day (N = 3) and unwillingness to complete the stress induction task
(MAST) (N = 2). 
3.  Materials
3. 1.  Rumination
The Event Related Ruminative Index was used in the previously
formed database to asses rumination.  This questionnaire is divided in
two scales (intrusive and deliberate rumination) and is thereby able to
discern positive from negative aspects of rumination.  This tool has been
found to be reliable and valid (Cann Name, 2011).  Both scales contain 10
items ranging on a four point scale, adding to a total score ranging from
0 to 40.  For the analysis of this study exclusively the Intrusive Rumination Scale was used as a measure of Rumination.  A median split was
used (on the former database, N = 827) to discern the high ruminators
from the low ruminators, in this sample the median lay at 17. 
3. 2.  Mood and salivary cortisol
3. 2. 1.  Total mood disturbance
Disturbance in mood was measured with a Dutch adaption of theStates-questionnaire
(Wald & Mellenbergh, 1990).  It contains 30 items (scores ranging fromversiontheTable 1

0 to 4) measuring mood in ﬁve diﬀerent scales (Vigour, Fatigue, Depression, Anxiety and Tension).  Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) is calculated by adding the total Fatigue, Depression, Anxiety and Tension
scores minus the Vigour score. 
3. 2. 2.  PANAS
Changes in positive and negative aﬀect were measured by using the
Positive And Negative Aﬀect Scale-questionnaire (Peeters Name, 1999;
Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988).  This questionnaire contains 10 items
for positive aﬀect (e. g.  interested, excited, proud) and 10 items for
negative aﬀect (e. g.  nervous, upset, irritable).  Total scores for both
scales are a sum of the scores on their respected items which all range
from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). 
3. 2. 3.  Salivary cortisol
Cortisol samples were obtained by using a Salivette sampling device
(Sarstedt ®, Etten-Leur; the Netherlands).  With this procedure, saliva
was collected in small polyester swabs and stored (−25 °C) immediately on collection.  Salivary free cortisol levels were determined in
duplicate by a commercially available luminescence immunoassay (IBL,
Hamburg, Germany).  Mean intra- and inter-assay coeﬃcients of variation were less than 4% and 8% respectively. 
3. 3.  Visual attention task (eye-tracking)
Eye-tracking was used to measure visual attention for food cues,
utilizing a desktop mounted Eyelink 1000 with headrest (www. srresearch. com).  Eye tracking has been proven to be an excellent method
of detecting attention biases for stimuli related to: tobacco (Field,
Mogg, & Bradley, 2004), cannabis (Field, Eastwood, Bradley, & Mogg,
2006) and food (Castellanos Name, 2009).  The task used was a selfdeveloped adaption of a Posner cueing task comparable to the paradigm
used by Castellanos Name (2009) The task was programmed and run
using Presentation (www. neurobs. com/).  Each trial began with a ﬁxation cross in the middle of the screen (for 1000 ms) following, two
images simultaneously appeared on either side of the screen for
2000 ms, lastly a target (colon sign) would appear on the left or right
side of the screen.  Participants were asked to look freely on the screen
except when the ﬁxation cross appeared.  Whenever a target appeared
they determined if it was on the left or the right side of the screen by
pressing corresponding buttons on a buttonbox, this was done as fast
and accurately as possible.  Critical image pairs contained one food related image and an (non-food) object matched for color, shape and
complexity, for instance a stack of chocolates was paired with an
equally big stack of dark wooden blocks.  Non-critical image pairs (ﬁller
pairs) contained only image pairs of objects.  Some images’ colors were
slightly manipulated with GIMP (https://www. gimp. org) to better
match with its pair.  The task was divided in 2 blocks with an approximate duration of 8 min each.  The ﬁrst block contained 20 image pairs
with high caloric savory food items (i. e.  hamburger or pizza), 20 pairs
with high caloric sweet food items (i. e.  donut or ice cream), 20 pairs
with low caloric foods (i. e.  apple or carrot) and 60 ﬁller pairs without
any food items.  The ﬁller pairs were used to vary the task and de-emphasize the food related images.  The second block contained the same
image pairs as the ﬁrst but mirrored (per pair the left and right images
switched location).  Between pairs image sizes could diﬀer but all
images were centered on the Y-axis and the outer edges of the images
were placed 1 cm from the outer edges of the screen on the X-axis.  The
order of image pairs was randomized, the order of target positions was
semi-randomized while an equal amount of congruent (target following
the location of the food-item) and incongruent (target following the
non-food item) trials was prearranged. 
3. 4.  Stress induction
To induce short term acute stress, the Maastricht Acute Stress Test
(MAST) was used.  This task has shown great reliability and validity in
inducing both cognitive and physiological stress responses by combining elements of the classic Trier Social Stress Test and the Cold
Pressor Task (Smeets Name, 2012).  During the ﬁve minute preparation
phase instructions are presented on a computer monitor and read out
loud by the experimenter.  Participants are told there will be several
trials in which they will have to submerge their hand in ice cold water
(4 °C) for a randomly chosen amount of time but never exceeding 90 s. 
In between these trials participants counted backwards in steps of 17
from 2043 as fast and accurately as possible, they were told that the
duration of these inter-trials would be random but at least 45 s.  Negative feedback was given by the experimenter if the participant made a
mistake while counting or counted too slow.  In reality the duration of
both the trials and inter-trials were not randomly decided but had a
ﬁxed duration, leading to a total time of 10 min for the completion of
the MAST.  During this task participants were also told that they would
be videotaped and they were able to see themselves on a monitor
through a direct camera-feed. 
As a manipulation check, changes in mood were measured by
questionnaires and salivary cortisol samples were used as a measure of
physical stress.  In the present study, after the last trial of the MAST,
participants were told that they were halfway through the task and
could now take a short break.  During this break participants provided a
saliva sample and reported their mood via questionnaire.  Afterwards,
they were told that there would not be a second part to the MAST. 
3. 5.  Procedure
All experiments were conducted from 11. 00 to 13. 00 or 11. 30 to
13. 30 to control for shifts in attention for food by time of day.  At arrival, participants ﬁrst reported their mood and provided a saliva
sample.  Following, they were seated in front of the eye tracking
equipment; the chair was adjusted to each person’s height so the
chinrest of the headrest would be at a constant 55 cm distance from the
camera.  Using a nine point calibration-program, the software was calibrated to each participant’s individual eye movements up until an
accuracy of at least 1° was attained.  After ﬁve practice trials the ﬁrst
block of experimental trials started, between the two blocks participants had a short break in which they could remove their head from the
headrest.  After completion of the eye-tracking task, participants were
brought to a diﬀerent room for the MAST, before and after stress induction they once again reported their mood and provided a saliva
sample.  Then, the eye-tracking task was completed for a second time
after which the participant’s mood was assessed again accompanied by
a saliva sample. 
3. 6.  Data preparation
Exclusively the eye-tracking data of the critical trials was analyzed,
only ﬁxations within the regions of the interest were used.  The regions
of interest followed the shape of the presented stimuli.  Fixations were
deﬁned as a gaze position that remained stable within 1° for more than
100 ms (as shorter ﬁxations might reﬂect anticipation).  Two dependent
variables were calculated with these data.  Duration bias (as a measure
of maintained attention) was calculated by dividing the total time
spend ﬁxating on a food picture divided by the total time spent ﬁxating
on either image.  If this number exceeds 0. 5 there is a preference for
food items, scores below 0. 5 signify a bias for non-food related items. 
Direction bias (the ﬁrst orientation after stimulus presentation) was
calculated by dividing the total number of ﬁrst ﬁxations on food pictures divided by the total number of trials in which the ﬁrst ﬁxation was
on either image.  Once more scores over 0. 5 signify an attention bias for
food pictures while scores under 0. 5 signify an attentional bias for nonfood related images. 
For both measures of attention bias three separate calculations were
made, one for each food type (high caloric savory, high caloric sweetR.  Schepers, C. R.  Markus
and low caloric). 
3. 7.  Statistical analysisData were ﬁrst examined for accuracy of data entry, missing values
and normal distributions.  Genotype distribution of the original database
(N = 827) was analyzed using a χ2 test showing no diﬀerence with the
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (χ2 = 0. 052, p = 0. 82). 
The main research questions were analyzed using GLM ANOVA
(SPSS 21 for Windows) with Genotype (S’/S’ vs L’/L’) and Rumination
(High vs Low) as between-subjects factor and Stress (pre vs post-stress)
as a within-subjects factor on Duration biases, Direction biases, cortisol
changes and mood (POMS & PANAS). 
To test for diﬀerences in baseline mood and cortisol
levels a
Univariate GLM ANOVA was run with Genotype (S/S vs L/L) and
Rumination (High vs Low) as between-subjects factors. 
To test responsivity of mood and cortisol in relation to the stress
induction, Repeated Measures ANOVA was used with Genotype (S’/S’,
L’/L’) and Rumination (High, Low) as within subjects-factors and Stress
(−20 min, 0 min, +20 min and +40 min to onset of stress induction)
as a between subjects-factors.  If sphericity assumptions were not met a
Greenhouse Geisser correction was used, in that case corrected F-values
and their corresponding degrees of freedom are reported.  All statistics
were conducted at a two-tailed signiﬁcance level of 5% and data are
reported as means ± Sd. 
4.  Results

for both men
(χ2 = 1. 53, p = 0. 22) and women (χ2 = 0. 95, p = 0. 33).  Univariate
