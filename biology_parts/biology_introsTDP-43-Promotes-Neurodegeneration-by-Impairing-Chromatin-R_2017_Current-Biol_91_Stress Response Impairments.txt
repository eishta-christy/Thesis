In Brief
Berson Name show that TDP-43, a protein
associated with ALS and FTD, impairs the
stress response by interfering with the
chromatin remodeling protein Chd1 in
ﬂies and CHD2 in mammalian cells.  In
turn, animals expressing TDP-43 are
hypersensitive to various types of
stressors, indicating that this impairment
may promote neurodegeneration.

https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 10. 024Regulation of chromatin structure is critical for brain
development and function.  However, the involvement of chromatin dynamics in neurodegeneration
is less well understood.  Here we ﬁnd, launching
from Drosophila models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, that TDP-43 impairs the induction of multiple key stress genes
required to protect from disease by reducing the
recruitment of the chromatin remodeler Chd1 to
chromatin.  Chd1 depletion robustly enhances TDP43-mediated neurodegeneration and promotes the
formation of stress granules.  Conversely, upregulation of Chd1 restores nucleosomal dynamics,
promotes normal
induction of protective stress
genes, and rescues stress sensitivity of TDP-43-expressing animals.  TDP-43-mediated impairments
are conserved in mammalian cells, and, importantly,
the human ortholog CHD2 physically interacts with
TDP-43 and is strikingly reduced in level in temporal
cortex of human patient
tissue.  These ﬁndings
indicate that TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration
causes impaired chromatin dynamics that prevents
appropriate expression of protective genes through
compromised function of the chromatin remodeler
Chd1/CHD2.  Enhancing chromatin dynamics may
be a treatment approach to amyotrophic lateral
scleorosis (ALS)/frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 
INTRODUCTION
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable, relentlessly
progressing neurodegenerative disease, leading to death within
3–5 years of diagnosis in most cases [1, 2].  In ALS, the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons leads to muscle atrophy,
weakness, and eventually paralysis.  Although predominantly a
motor disorder, 20% of ALS cases also develop cognitive deficits that resemble those seen in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 
Strikingly, ALS and select FTD subtypes share the pathological
hallmark of ubiquitinated inclusions composed of TDP-43 protein, encoded by the TARDBP gene [3]. 
The discovery of TARDBP mutations in ALS and FTD [4, 5]
demonstrates that TDP-43 plays causal roles in the pathogenesis of these diseases.  Therefore, understanding the molecular
events underlying TDP-43 toxicity is of special
importance. 
Indeed, abnormal TDP-43 levels and localization are toxic to
neurons [6], elicit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [7], and
impair multiple cellular processes, including axonal transport
[8], mitochondrial function [9], and RNA metabolism [10].  TDP43 is a ubiquitously expressed RNA- and DNA-binding protein,
with primarily nuclear localization.  Interestingly, TDP-43 was
originally identiﬁed as a transcriptional
[11], but
DNA-related functions of TDP-43 remain largely unexplored. 
repressor
Proper chromatin regulation is critical for gene expression in
the brain [12, 13], and various epigenetic mechanisms including
DNA methylation [14], histone acetylation [15], and histone
variant exchange [16] have been shown to control memory formation and consolidation.  Recent observations also point to
possible altered histone methylation and acetylation having a
role during brain degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease [17] and
in models of tauopathies [18].  Chromatin remodeling is carried
out by a large family of ATP-dependent enzymes that modify
chromatin structure by depositing, sliding, and evicting histones
[19].  Mutations in multiple chromatin remodelers are associated
with human mental disorders, suggesting that imbalance of
neuronal chromatin structure and the ensuing alterations in
gene expression are detrimental to brain function [20].  The
CHD family of chromatin remodelers is characterized by tandem
chromodomains in the N-terminal region and a central catalytic
domain with homology to the canonical SNF2-like ATPase
domain.  Vertebrates contain CHD1 and CHD2, which form a
unique subfamily due to the presence of a C-terminal DNA-binding domain [21], whereas in invertebrates only one gene, Chd1,Here we took an unbiased screening approach to askwhether chromatin regulatory proteins might be critical

neurodegeneration.  We ﬁnd an unexpected role of TDP-43 in impairing Chd1-dependent chromatin dynamics at stress genes,
thus reducing the protective stress response and promoting
neurodegeneration.  We also ﬁnd a striking loss of CHD2 in human FTD cortex, indicating that impaired chromatin remodeling
may be a key event in ALS/FTD.

TDP-43 Toxicity Is Modulated by H3K4me3-Related
Genes in Drosophila
We performed an in vivo RNAi screen in which we reduced
expression of 84 genes related to various aspects of chromatin
regulation in a Drosophila model of ALS/FTD (Table S1; genes
were selected as in [22]).  The gene set included histone methyltransferases, demethylases, acetyltransferases (HATs), and deacetylases (HDACs), as well as associated factors, histones, and
chromatin remodelers.  We expressed TDP-43 in the ﬂy eye with
the binary GAL4/UAS expression system.  Such ﬂies show progressive retinal deterioration that can be visualized externally,
providing a simple and rapid readout of TDP-43 toxicity and
potential gene enhancers or suppressors [23].  We followed the
screen with secondary tests using a model of TDP-43-mediated
brain degeneration. 
Following exclusion of RNAi lines that affected eye integrity on
their own, the screen uncovered 31 modiﬁers, 4 of which we
classiﬁed as ‘‘strong’’ and 27 as ‘‘mild’’ based on eye structure
(Figure 1A).  The modiﬁers, both enhancers and suppressors of
TDP-43 toxicity, included a range of genes from most of the
tested functional categories.  However, we noted that six modiﬁers were related to histone H3 trimethyl lysine 4 (H3K4me3; Figure 1A), a mark associated with active gene expression [24].  Two
strong modiﬁers were lid and Chd1 (Figures 1B and 1C): knockdown of lid, an H3K4me3 demethylase [25], strongly suppressed
TDP-43 toxicity, whereas knockdown of Chd1, a chromatin ATPdependent remodeling factor associated with H3K4me3 [26],
enhanced TDP-43 toxicity (Figures 1B and 1C).  Knockdown of
three components of COMPASS (conserved multiprotein complexes that mediate methylation of H3K4 [27]) showed mild
enhancement of TDP-43 toxicity.  These were Set1, the major
H3K4me3 lysine methyltransferase [28], and the subunits ash2
and Wdr82 (Figure S1A).  Taken together, these genetic interactions suggested that gain of H3K4 methylation suppressed
toxicity, whereas toxicity was enhanced by loss of H3K4 methylation or function. 
To assess the speciﬁcity of these interactions, we manipulated
other chromatin marks and examined TDP-43-mediated degeneration.  These data showed that modulation of genes that alter
methylation of H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, or H3K79 had no effect
on TDP-43 toxicity (Figure S1B).  Furthermore, knockdown of
Su(var)3-3, which demethylates mono and dimethyl H3K4 [29],
also had little effect on TDP-43 toxicity (Figure S1A). 
The efﬁciency of lid and Chd1 knockdown was conﬁrmed using real-time qRT-PCR (Figure S1C).  We focused additional analyses on lid and Chd1 because of their strong modulation of
TDP43.  Modulation by lid and Chd1 was speciﬁc to TDP-43,
because reduction of lid or Chd1 on their own did not affect
integrity of the eye (Figure S1D) and did not impact the toxicity
of another neurodegenerative disease protein, Tau (Figure S1D).

Furthermore, lid and Chd1 knockdown did not alter TDP-43
levels or nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning (Figures S1E and
S1F).  Thus, the screen identiﬁed a selective genetic interaction
between TDP-43 and chromatin factors related speciﬁcally to
the H3K4me3 chromatin mark. 
We next tested whether manipulation of lid and Chd1 could
alter TDP-43 toxicity in the nervous system.  Expression of
TDP-43 using the neuronal driver elav-Gal4 shortened lifespan
and impaired motor abilities (chamber wall climbing).  Knockdown of Chd1 further shortened lifespan and further impaired
motor function, whereas lid knockdown prolonged lifespan and
mitigated motor dysfunction (Figure 1D; Figure S1G).  Importantly, Chd1 and lid knockdown on their own had no effect on
lifespan (Figure 1E). 
lid and Set1,
We considered the possibility that TDP-43 expression itself
affected the level of the H3K4me3 mark.  We therefore examined the levels of H3K4me3 in brains of animals expressing
TDP-43, compared to knockdown ofH3K4me3 demethylase and methyltransferase, respectively. 
Although there was a striking effect of both lid and Set1 in
modulating brain H3K4me3 levels, TDP-43 expression had no
effect (Figure 1F).  Chd1 depletion does not affect H3K4me3
levels [30].  Furthermore, in the background of TDP-43 expression, knockdown of lid, Set1, and Chd1 exerted similar effects
on H3K4me3 as they did in control ﬂies (Figure S1H).  These
data suggested that it is not the level of H3K4me3 that is
important but rather functional
interactions, for example the
recruitment of remodeling factors to chromatin that might be
especially relevant, given the identiﬁcation of Chd1 as a strong
TDP-43 modiﬁer. 
TDP-43 Mediates Stress Response Impairments
via Chd1
Chd1 is a nucleosome remodeling enzyme of the SNF2 family;
human CHD1 speciﬁcally binds to H3K4me3 [26], and
Drosophila Chd1 largely overlaps with H3K4me3 on chromatin
[31].  However, given that global levels of H3K4me3 were unaffected by TDP-43, our ﬁndings raised the possibility that select
targets of Chd1 might be of special importance to TDP-43-associated toxicity.
