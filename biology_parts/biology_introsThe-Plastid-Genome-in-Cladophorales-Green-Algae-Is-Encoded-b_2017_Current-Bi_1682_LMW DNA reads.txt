https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 004Virtually all plastid (chloroplast) genomes are circular double-stranded DNA molecules, typically between 100 and 200 kb in size and encoding circa
80–250 genes.  Exceptions to this universal plastid
genome architecture are very few and include the
dinoﬂagellates, where genes are located on DNA
minicircles.  Here we report on the highly deviant
chloroplast genome of Cladophorales green algae,
which is entirely fragmented into hairpin chromosomes.  Short- and long-read high-throughput
sequencing of DNA and RNA demonstrated that
the chloroplast genes of Boodlea composita are
encoded on 1- to 7-kb DNA contigs with an exceptionally high GC content, each containing a long inverted repeat with one or two protein-coding genes
and conserved non-coding regions putatively
involved in replication and/or expression.  We propose that
these contigs correspond to linear
single-stranded DNA molecules that fold onto themselves to form hairpin chromosomes.  The Boodlea
chloroplast genes are highly divergent from their
corresponding orthologs, and display an alternative
genetic code.  The origin of this highly deviant chloroplast genome most likely occurred before the
emergence of the Cladophorales, and coincided
with an elevated transfer of chloroplast genes
to the nucleus.  A chloroplast genome thatcomposed only of linear DNA molecules is unprecedented among eukaryotes, and highlights unexpected variation in plastid genome architecture. 
INTRODUCTION
Photosynthetic eukaryotes possibly originated 1. 9 billion years
ago following an endosymbiotic event in which a heterotrophic
ancestor of the Archaeplastida engulfed a cyanobacterium that
became stably integrated and evolved into a membrane-bound
organelle, the plastid [1, 2].  Following this primary endosymbiosis, an intricate history of plastid acquisition via eukaryoteeukaryote endosymbioses resulted in the spread of plastids to
distantly related eukaryotic lineages [3]. 
Plastids have retained a reduced version of the genome inherited from their cyanobacterial ancestor.  A core set of genes
involved in the light reactions of photosynthesis, ATP generation,
and functions related to transcription and translation is typically
retained [4].  Many genes have been lost or transferred to the nuclear genome and, as a result, plastids are dependent on nuclear-encoded, plastid-targeted proteins for the maintenance
of essential biochemical pathways and other functions such as
genome replication, gene expression, and DNA repair [5].  Nearly
all plastid genomes consist of a single circular-mapping chromosome, typically between 100 and 200 kb and encoding circa
80–250 genes [4, 6].  Diversity in size, gene content, density,
and organization of plastid genomes among different eukaryotic
lineages [7–9] is by and large limited, especially when compared
to mitochondria. 
Whereas fragmented mitochondrial genomes evolved several
times independently during the evolution of eukaryotes [8, 10],
fragmented plastid genomes are only known in dinoﬂagellates
[11] and a single green algal species [12].  In peridinin-containing
dinoﬂagellates,
the chloroplast genome is fragmented into
DNA minicircles of 2–3 kb, most of which carry one gene only
[11, 13].  Larger minicircles of up to 12 kb have also been
described [14], as well as minicircles containing two genes [15]
and ‘‘empty’’ minicircles without genes [16].  The genes located
on these minicircles mostly encode key components of the major

plasmid-like DNA that has been observed
in the chloroplasts of several species
[29, 30].  These plasmid-like DNA molecules represent a low-molecular-weight
(LMW) DNA fraction, visible on agarose
gels of total DNA extracts (Figure 1D).  Pioneering work revealed that these structures are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
molecules of 1. 5–3. 0 kb that fold into a
hairpin conﬁguration and lack sequence
similarity to the nuclear DNA [31, 32]. the hairpin-like DNAs contain
putatively transcribed sequences with
similarity to chloroplast genes encoding
(psaB, psbB, psbC, and
subunits of photosystems I and II
psbF) [31]. 
Here we describe intriguing features of the plastid genome of
Cladophorales, focusing on Boodlea composita.  Through the
integration of different DNA sequencing methods, combined
with RNA sequencing, we found that chloroplast protein-coding
genes are highly expressed and encoded on 1- to 7-kb linear
ssDNA molecules.  Due to the widespread presence of inverted
repeats, these molecules fold into a hairpin conﬁguration.  A chloroplast genome that is composed only of linear DNA molecules is
unprecedented among eukaryotes, and highlights unexpected
variation in plastid genome architecture. 
<Middle> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. 
DNA and RNA Sequencing Data
Our reconstruction of the chloroplast genome of B.  composita is
based on different high-throughput DNA sequencing methods
(Figure S1; STAR Methods).  The choice of short-read DNA
sequencing of isolated intact chloroplasts (chloroplast-enriched
fraction) using Roche 454 technology was based on comparable
sequencing approaches in other plants and algae that successfully resulted in assembly of chloroplast genomes [25].  To overcome possible assembly artifacts in a hypothetical scenario of
an inﬂated chloroplast genome bloated by repetitive elements,
long-read sequencing ofDNA fraction using the Paciﬁc Biosciences Single-Molecule
Real-Time (SMRT) method was applied, whereas long-read
sequencing of the LMW DNA fraction allowed characterization
of the previously observed plasmid-like DNA in the chloroplast
[29, 30].  To allow comparison of the results of Boodlea with
the high-molecular-weight
photosynthetic complexes, including subunits of photosystems I
and II, the cytochrome b6f complex, and ATP synthase, as well
as rRNAs and a few tRNAs [11].  The only other alga with a fragmented chloroplast genome is the green alga Koshicola spirodelophila, but here the level of fragmentation is minor: the plastid
genome is divided into three large circular chromosomes totaling
385 kb, with a gene content comparable to other green algae
[12].  In addition, plastid minicircles that coexist with a conventional plastid genome have been observed in a few algae,
including dinoﬂagellates with haptophyte-derived plastids [17]
and the green alga Acetabularia [18, 19]. 
Although plastid genomes generally assemble as circularmapping DNAs, they can take multiple complex conformations
in vivo, including multigenomic, linear-branched structures with
discrete termini [20, 21].  The alveolate Chromera velia is the
only known alga with a linear-mapping plastid genome with telomeric arrangement [22], and is also atypical in that several core
photosynthesis genes are fragmented.  Linear plastid genomes,
however, may be more widespread, as several plastid genomes
currently do not map as a circle [23]. 
Currently, and in stark contrast to other algae [9, 24–26], little
is known about the gene content and structure of the chloroplast genome in the Cladophorales (Ulvophyceae), an ecologically important group of marine and freshwater green algae,
which includes several hundreds of species.  These macroscopic multicellular algae have giant, multinucleate cells containing numerous chloroplasts (Figures 1A–1C).  Most attempts
to amplify common chloroplast genes have failed [27], with only
one highly divergent rbcL sequence published thus far for
Chaetomorpha valida [28].  An atypical plastid genome in
the Cladophorales is suggested by the presence of abundant

other species of Cladophorales, we generated additional DNA
sequence data from nine other species using Illumina HiSeq 2000
technology.  Finally, two deep-coverage RNA-seq (sequencing)
libraries, a total-RNA library, and an mRNA library enriched for
nuclear transcripts were generated to conﬁrm the transcription
of genes and to inform whether genes are nuclear versus plastid
encoded. 
A Prodigious Chloroplast Genome with a Reduced
Gene Set
Assembly of the chloroplast-enriched DNA reads generated using Roche 454 technology did not result in a typical circular chloroplast genome.  Instead, 21 chloroplast protein-coding genes
were found on 58 short contigs (1,203–5,426 bp): atpA, atpB,
atpH, atpI, petA, petB, petD, psaA, psaB, psaC, psbA, psbB,
psbC, psbD, psbE, psbF, psbJ, psbK, psbL, psbT, and rbcL. 
All but the rbcL gene code for components of the major thylakoid
transmembrane protein complexes (ATP synthase, cytochrome
b6f, and photosystems I and II).  The contigs contained inverted
repeats at their termini and, despite high coverage by sequence
reads, could not be extended by iterative contig extension. 
Sequence similarity searches and a metagenomic binning
approach (distribution analysis of 4-mers) demonstrated that
the inverted repeats were also found on contigs with no
sequence similarity to known proteins, raising the number of
contigs of chloroplast origin to 136.  These contigs are further
referred to as ‘‘chloroplast 454 contigs. ’’ The length distribution
of the chloroplast 454 contigs was consistent with the size of the
LMW DNA fraction as estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis
of Boodlea genomic DNA (Figure 1D; Figures S6A and S6B). 
The failure to assemble a circular chloroplast genome might be
due to repetitive elements that impair the performance of shortread assemblers [33].  Inﬂated chloroplast genomes bloated by
repetitive elements have been documented in several green
algae [34–36].  To overcome assembly artifacts and close putative gaps in the chloroplast 454 contigs, we applied SMRT
sequencing to the HMW and LMW DNA fractions.  Only 22
HMW DNA reads (ca.  0. 044%) harbored protein-coding genes
commonly present in chloroplast genomes of Archaeplastida
(Figure 2A).  All but three of these genes (psbA, psbB, and
psbC, which likely correspond to carry-over LMW DNA) contained spliceosomal introns, were absent in the chloroplast 454
contigs, and revealed a high ratio between mapped mRNA and
total-RNA reads, altogether suggesting that they are encoded
in the nucleus (Figure S2A).  Conversely, 22 chloroplast genes
(that is, the 21 protein-coding genes identiﬁed in chloroplast
454 contigs as well as the 16S rRNA gene) were found in the
LMW DNA reads (Figure 2A).  An orthology-guided assembly,
where the chloroplast 454 contigs harboring protein-coding
genes guided the assembly of LMW DNA reads with sequence
similarity to chloroplast genes, resulted in 34 contigs between
1,179 and 6,925 bp in length, henceforth referred to as the ‘‘chloroplast genome’’ (Figure 2B; Table S1). 
Four contigs of the Boodlea chloroplast genome (contigs 10,
19, 32, and 33) display long palindromic sequences that include
full-length coding sequences (CDSs) and a less conserved tail
region (Figure 2B).  The remaining contigs have similar palindromic structures but appear to be not completely assembled. 
Such palindromes allow regions of the single-stranded LMW
DNA molecules to fold into hairpin-like secondary structures. 
Additional smaller inverted repeats were identiﬁed in many of
the contigs (Figure 2B), which may result in more complex secondary structures. 
Chloroplast 454 contigs could not be scaffolded with long
HMW DNA reads, nor did a hybrid assembly between chloroplast 454 contigs and long HMW DNA reads generate a circular
chloroplast genome (Figure S1; STAR Methods).  The LMW DNA
reads are concordant and consistent with the palindromic sequences of the assembled chloroplast genome, indicating that
the palindromes are not a result of assembly artifacts (Figure 3;
Table S1).  As a consequence, we conclude that the chloroplast
genome is not a single large molecule but that it is instead fragmented into several molecules in the LMW DNA. 
A chloroplast genome that is entirely fragmented into hairpin
chromosomes is in line with earlier observations of abundant
LMW DNA in chloroplasts of several species of Cladophorales
[29].  The hairpin conﬁguration of the chromosomes derived
from our sequence data corresponds to earlier data based on
electron microscopy, endo- and exonuclease digestion experiments, acridine orange staining, and denaturing gel electrophoresis [29, 32].  Fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern
blot hybridization indicated that these plasmid-like DNA molecules are present within the chloroplast only [30], supporting
the congruence between chloroplast 454 contigs and sequences from the LMW fraction (Figure 3; Figure S7A). 
The chloroplast genome contigs of Boodlea feature an exceptionally high GC content, ranging from 54% to 60% in the genecontaining contigs (average 57%) (Table S1).  These values are
concordant with the high density of the LMW fraction observed
in CsCl/bisbenzimide gradients [29], and also with sequence
data from cloned plasmids of Ernodesmis (51%–59% GC) [31]. 
Plastid genomes are generally AT rich and, in green algal species, GC content typically ranges between 26% and 43%
[9, 37].  GC-rich plastid genomes are very rare, but higher values
have been reported for the trebouxiophycean green algae Coccomyxa subellipsoidea, Paradoxia multiseta (both 51% GC), and

The size of the Boodlea chloroplast genome could not be estimated by inspection of k-mer frequency distributions of the
reads in the 454 library nor from those of the uncorrected and
corrected LMW DNA reads [38].  Histograms of k-mer frequency
distributions revealed several small peaks, indicating a heterogeneous population of molecules present in different stoichiometries, and the signal-to-noise ratio was too small to make a
comfortable estimation of the sizes (Figure S3).  The cumulative

population of LMW DNA reads bearing no similarity to proteincoding genes (empty hairpin chromosomes; see below) as part
of the chloroplast genome, its size could be regarded as muchthe Volvox carteri
The largest known circular-mapping chloroplast genomes
have been documented in the red algae Bulboplastis apyrenoidosa (610 kb) and Corynoplastis japonica (1. 127 Mb), where
the genomes are bloated by group II introns and include transposable elements of possible bacterial origin [8].  Within green
algae, expanded chloroplast genomes have been reported in
two distinct clades: the Chlorophyceae and the Ulvophyceae. 
Inﬂation of the 521-kb chloroplast genome of Floydiella terrestris
(Chlorophyceae)
resulted mainly from the proliferation of
dispersed, heterogeneous repeats (>30 bp) in intergenic regions,
representing more than half of the genome length [36].  Intergenic
regions of
(Chlorophyceae) chloroplast
genome, instead, are populated with short palindromic repeats
(average size of 50 bp) that constitute ca.  64% of the predicted
525-kb genome [34].  The mechanisms by which such palindromic selﬁsh DNA spreads throughout the Volvox chloroplast
genome are not clear, but the presence of a reverse transcriptase and endonuclease may point toward retrotranscription
[34, 39].  For Acetabularia acetabulum (Ulvophyceae),chloroplast genome was sequenced only partially and its size
was estimated to exceed 1 Mb; it has exceptionally long intergenic regions and features long repetitive elements (>10 kb)
arranged in tandem [35, 40].  The Boodlea chloroplast genome
is rich as well
in non-coding DNA, constituting 92. 2% of the
136 chloroplast 454 contigs and 72. 8% of the assembled chloroplast genome, comparable to that
in inﬂated chloroplast
genomes of other green algae (F.  terrestris, 82. 1%; V.  carteri,
ca.  80%; A.  acetabulum, ca.  87% of the sequenced chloroplast
genome) [34, 35]. 
The non-coding DNA (ncDNA) regions of the hairpins showed
high sequence similarity among one another (52. 5%–100%
sequence similarity).  Within the ncDNA, we identiﬁed six
conserved motifs, 20–35 bp in length and with a GC content
3776 Current Biology 27, 3771–3782, December 18, 2017
ranging from 36% to 84%, which lack similarity to known regulatory elements (Figure 4).  Motifs 1, 2, and 5 were always present
upstream of the start codon of the chloroplast genes, occasionally in more than one copy.  Although their distances from the
start codon were variable, their orientations relative to the gene
were conserved, indicating a potential function as a regulatory
element of gene expression and/or replication of the hairpin
chromosomes. 
These motifs were also present in 1,966 (ca.  1. 8%) LMW DNA
reads lacking genes.  This observation supports earlier ﬁndings
of abundant non-coding LMW DNA molecules in the Cladophorales [29, 31].  In contrast, a very small fraction of the HMW DNA
reads (15 corrected reads) displayed the same ncDNA motifs,
and these were present exclusively on long terminal repeat retrotransposons (RT-LTRs) (Figures S2D and S2E).  RT-LTRs were
also abundant in the 454 contigs (Figure S6D).  The abundance
of RT-LTRs in the 454 contigs and the presence of ncDNA motifs
in both the Boodlea chloroplast genome and nuclear RT-LTRs
are suggestive of DNA transfer between the nucleus and chloroplast and may allude to the origin of the hairpin chromosomes. 
Hypothetically, an invasion of nuclear RT-LTRs in the chloroplast
genome may have resulted in an expansion of the chloroplast
genome and its subsequent fragmentation into hairpin chromosomes during replication.  Chloroplast genome fragmentation
could be caused by recombination between repetitive elements
and displacement of the palindromic sequences from the lagging
strand during the chloroplast genome replication [41, 42], and is
consistent with the expectation that recombination and cleavage
of repetitive DNA will produce a heterogeneous population of
molecules, as observed in dinoﬂagellate plastid genomes [11]
and in the Boodlea LMW DNA.

approaches resulted in the assembly of circular chloroplast genomes for other algae, including green seaweeds [43, 44], only
short chloroplast contigs (ca.  200–8,000 bp) were assembled
from these libraries, similar to B.  composita.  Interestingly, a
similar set of chloroplast genes was identiﬁed in all sequenced
Cladophorales species (Table S5).  In contrast to the genes found
in the Boodlea hairpin chromosomes, however, most of the chloroplast genes identiﬁed in the additional Cladophorales libraries
were fragmented, possibly due to assembly of the shorter
Illumina reads (Table S3).  These ﬁndings support the idea that
fragmentation of the chloroplast genome occurred before or
early in the evolution of the Cladophorales. 
Highly Divergent Chloroplast Genes
The 21 chloroplast protein-coding genes of Boodlea and the
other species of Cladophorales display extremely high sequence
divergence compared to orthologous genes in other photosynthetic organisms (Figure 5).  A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic
tree based on a concatenated amino acid alignment of 19 chloroplast genes from Archaeplastida and Cyanobacteria species
(Figure 5) shows that despite their high divergence, the Cladophorales sequences form a monophyletic group within the core
Chlorophyta (Figure S4), a position that is supported by phylogenetic analyses of nuclear genes [45].  The high sequence divergence of chloroplast genes in the Cladophorales supports the
notion that organellar genomes with extremely derived architectures, including those of peridinin-containing dinoﬂagellates,
also tend to fall at the extreme ends of the range observed at
the mutation rate (or gene sequence divergence) level [7, 46]. 
For some Boodlea chloroplast genes, the identiﬁcation of start
and stop codons was uncertain and a non-canonical genetic
code was identiﬁed (Figure 6).  The canonical stop codon UGA
was found 11 times internally in six genes (petA, psaA, psaB,
psaC, psbC, and rbcL) but was also present as a genuine termination codon in several genes, petA and psaA included.  At seven
of these 11 positions, the corresponding amino acid residue in
orthologous genes was conserved (i. e. , present in more than
75% of the taxa in the alignment), but different amino acids
were observed at these positions: V, Q, I, L, and C (Figure 6). 
The reassignment of the stop codon UGA to C has been documented in the nuclear genetic code of several species of ciliates
[47].  For the remaining positions, the amino acid in the alignment
Deviations from the universal genetic code are widespread
among mitochondrial genomes, and include loss of start
and stop codons in some groups,
including dinoﬂagellates
[11, 48, 49]. 
In contrast, non-canonical genetic codes are
much rarer in plastid genomes, and up to now have only been
detected in the apicomplexans Neospora caninum [50], C.  velia
[22], and the dinoﬂagellate Lepidodinium chlorophorum [51].  In
genomes of primary plastids, a non-canonical genetic code is
unprecedented. 
Dual meaning of UGA as both stop and sense codons has
recently been reported from a number of unrelated protists
[47, 52, 53].  Although in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the tetranucleotide UGA-C allows increased incorporation of the nearcognate Cys-tRNA for the UGA premature termination codon
[54], such preference was not observed in the Boodlea chloroplasts. 
Importantly, a non-canonical genetic code has also
been described for Cladophorales nuclear genes, where UAG
and UAA codons are reassigned to glutamine [55], which implies
two independent departures from the standard genetic code in a
single organism. 
Unexpectedly, we found that the 16S rRNA gene in the Boodlea chloroplast genome is split across two distinct hairpin chromosomes and that its size is much smaller compared to its algal
and bacterial homologs (Figures 2B and 7).  Fragmentation of
rRNA genes has been observed in organellar genomes, including
Apicomplexa, dinoﬂagellates, and many green algae [10].  In general, fragmentation of protein-coding and rRNA genes is more
common in mitochondrial genomes than in plastid genomes
[17, 22, 56].  Despite considerable effort, we could not detect
the 23S rRNA gene nor the 5S rRNA gene. 
The transcription of
the aberrant chloroplast genes was
conﬁrmed using RNA-seq, and is concordant with previous results of northern blots [31].  Transcripts of 21 chloroplast genes
(that is, 20 protein-coding genes as well as the 16S rRNA
gene) were identical to the genes encoded by the chloroplast
454 contigs (Figures 2A and 3; Figure S5), providing evidence
for the absence of RNA editing and corroborating the use of a
non-canonical genetic code (Figure S5).  Lack of RNA editing
was also evidenced for the 11 internal occurrences of UGA (Figure S5).  This observation, in combination with conservation of
the sequence after the UGA codon, serves as evidence that it
is not a termination codon but an alternative code.  The high
total-RNA-to-mRNA ratio observed for reads that mapped to

the chloroplast 454 contigs conﬁrmed that these genes were not
transcribed in the nucleus (Figure S6C).  All coding sequences of
the same protein-coding genes found on different contigs of the
Boodlea chloroplast genome were expressed, despite minor differences in their nucleotide sequences (Table S1). 
Additional transcripts of 66 genes that have been located in
the chloroplast in other Archaeplastida were identiﬁed (Figure 2A).  Although their subcellular origin was not determined
experimentally, they are probably all nuclear encoded, based
on high mRNA-to-total-RNA read ratios and their presence on
high molecular weight (HMW) DNA reads. 
<Conclusion> Conclusions. 
We collected several lines of evidence indicating that B.  composita lacks a typical large circular chloroplast genome.  The chloroplast genome is instead fragmented into multiple linear hairpin
chromosomes, and has a highly reduced gene repertoire
compared to other chloroplast genomes.  Thirty-four hairpin
chromosomes were identiﬁed, harboring 21 protein-coding

genes and the 16S rRNA gene, which are highly divergent in
sequence compared to orthologs in other algae and display an
alternative genetic code.  The exact set of Boodlea chloroplast
genes remains elusive, but at least 19 genes coding for chloroplast products appear to be nuclear encoded, of which nine
are always chloroplast encoded in related green algae (Figure 2A).  This suggests that fragmentation of a conventional chloroplast genome in the Cladophorales has been accompanied by
an elevated transfer of genes to the nucleus, similar to the situation in peridinin-containing dinoﬂagellates [11], with plastid genomes encoding about 12 genes or fewer [11, 57].  Notably, the
two distantly related algal groups have converged on a very
similar gene distribution: chloroplast genes code only for the
subunits of photosynthetic complexes (and also for Rubisco in
Boodlea), whereas the expression machinery appears to be fully
nuclear encoded (Figure 2A).  Other nonstandard chloroplast
genome architectures have recently been observed, such as
a monomeric linear chromosome in the alveolate microalga
C.  velia [22] and three circular chromosomes in the green algaB

(A) The Boodlea chloroplast 16S rRNA sequence was compared with the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA secondary structure model (RF00177).  Residues shown in
green and red on the E.  coli model represent the 16S rRNA regions coded by the two hairpin chromosomes.  Residues in black are absent in Boodlea 16S rRNA. 
Blue numbers indicate secondary structure helices in the 16S rRNA model. 
(B) Comparison between Boodlea and E.  coli 16S rRNA annotated functional regions.  The quality of the alignment was assessed based on the predicted posterior
probability (in percentage) of each aligned region: very low, <25%; low, between 25% and 50%; high, between 50% and 95%; and perfect, >95%.

K.  spirodelophila [12], but these represent relatively small deviations from the paradigm, when compared to the chloroplast
genome of the Cladophorales.  The highly fragmented chloroplast genome in the Cladophorales is wholly unprecedented,
and will be of signiﬁcance to understanding processes driving
organellar genome fragmentation and gene reduction, endosymbiotic gene transfer, and the minimal functional chloroplast
gene set.

Phycology Research Group, Ghent University.  The specimens were grown in enriched sterilized natural seawater at 22
 1.  To prepare the enriched natural seawater, 20 mL of enriched
(light:dark) cool white ﬂuorescent light at 60 mmol photons m
solution is added to 980 mL of ﬁltered and sterilized natural seawater.  The enriched solution consists of: Tris base 5. 0 g/L; NaNO3
3. 5 g/L; Na2 b-glycerophosphate ∙ H2O; Na2EDTA ∙ 2 H2O 0. 529 g/L; Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 ∙ 6 H2O 0. 176 g/L; FeCl3 ∙ 6 H2O 12. 1 mg/

METHOD DETAILS
Genomic DNA sequencing
Total genomic DNA from fresh Boodlea cultures was isolated by using a modiﬁed CTAB extraction protocol [84].  Brieﬂy, 100 mg of
fresh algal material was blotted dry on paper, placed inside a 1. 5 mL test tube and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Samples
were ground with a pestle that ﬁts the 1. 5 mL tubes and resuspended in 500 mL of CTAB isolation buffer (2% w/v cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 1. 4 M NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. 0, 20 mM EDTA pH 8. 0, 1% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidone) with 5 mL of Proteinase K
C for 40 min.  After 30 min, 5 mL of RNase A (QUIAGEN) was added to
(QUIAGEN, Germany).  The samples were then incubated at 60
each sample.  Cellular debris were spun down and the aqueous layer was extracted ﬁrst with phenol:chloroform:isoamylic alchoolCurrent Biology 27, 3771–3782. e1–e6, December 18, 2017 e3
(25:24:1 v/v) and then with chloroform:isoamylic alchool (24:1 v/v).  Genomic DNA was precipitated with the addition of two volumes
of ice-cold absolute ethanol and 0. 3 M sodium acetate pH 5. 5 to each sample and overnight incubation at  20
C.  The genomic DNA
was washed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, air-dried and dissolved in 50 mL TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. 0, 1 mM Na2-EDTA).  HMW
and LMW DNA bands were size-selected using a BluePippin system (Sage Science, USA).  The HMW DNA band was isolated with a
cut-off range of 10 kb to 50 kb, while the LMW DNA band was isolated with a cut-off range of 1. 5 kb to 2. 5 kb.  The quantity, quality
and integrity of the extracted DNA were assessed with Qubit (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, USA), Nanodrop spectrophotometer
(ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc), and Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, USA). 
Intact chloroplasts were isolated from living Boodlea cells following the protocol of Palmer Name [85].  In short, 200 g of Boodlea
ﬁlaments were placed in 400 mL of ice-cold isolation buffer (0. 35 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. 0, 5 mM EDTA, 0. 1% BSA,
1. 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol), homogenized in a blender at 4
C, and ﬁltered through miracloth (Calbiochem).  The ﬁltrate was centriC, the supernatant was poured off, and the pellet resuspended in 8 mL of ice-cold wash buffer
fuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 4
(0. 35 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. 0, 25 mM EDTA).  The resuspended pellet was loaded on a step gradient consisting of
C.  The chlo18 mL of 52% w/v sucrose, over-layered with 7 mL of 30% w/v sucrose, and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 40 min at 4
roplast band was removed from the 30%–52% interface using a Pasteur pipette, diluted with 6 volumes of wash buffer, centrifuged atC, and resuspended in wash buffer to a ﬁnal volume of 10 mL.  This fraction of isolated chloroplasts is further
1,500 g for 15 min at 4
referred to as ‘‘ chloroplast-enriched fraction. ’’ DNA from the chloroplast-enriched fraction was sequenced with Roche 454 GS FLX at
GATC Biotech, Germany.  The HMW and LMW DNA fractions were sequenced on two SMRT cells on a PacBio RS II (VIB Nucleomics
Core facilities, Leuven, Belgium) using PacBio P5 polymerase and C3 chemistry combination (P5-C3).  For the HMW DNA fraction, a
20-kb SMRT-bell library was constructed, while for the LMW DNA fraction, a 2-kb SMRT-bell library was constructed. 
Chloroplast DNA assembly and annotation
Quality of the reads from the 454 library was assessed with FastQC v. 0. 10. 1 (http://www. bioinformatics. babraham. ac. uk, last accessed March 01, 2017) (Table S2).  Low-quality reads (average Phred quality score below 20) were discarded and low-qualityends of the reads were trimmed with Fastx v. 0. 0. 13 (https://github. com/agordon/fastx_toolkit, last accessed March 01, 2017). After trimming, reads shorter than 50 bp were discarded.  De novo assembly of the trimmed reads was performed with MIRA v. 
4. 0rc5 [58].  The assembly resulted in 3,735 contigs, which will be further referred to as ‘‘454 contigs’’ (Table S3).  Length distribution
of the 454 contigs is reported in Figure S6B. 
After the assembly, putative chloroplast contigs were identiﬁed by comparing their translated sequences against the NCBI nonredundant protein database using BLAST 2. 2. 29+ [59], resulting in the identiﬁcation of 58 contigs harboring fragments or full-lengthchloroplast genes by sequence similarity search.  These contigs had long stretches of conserved repetitive sequences at their 5extremities.  The conserved inverted repeats were used in a sequence similarity search with high stringency (high mismatch cost,high cost for gap opening and gap extension, long minimal word-size) against the 454 contigs to identify 18 additional contigs of putative chloroplast origin.  This initial set of 76 contigs had a mean coverage of 84 3, ranging between 11 3 and 191 3.  17 of the 76
contigs had internal inverted repeats, with a sudden drop in read coverage.  These contigs were regarded as chimeric contigs and
were cleaved at the sites of coverage drop, raising the number of contigs of chloroplast origin to 89. Additional chloroplast contigs without similarity to protein-coding genes were identiﬁed by metagenomic binning (distribution analysis of 4-mers) with MyCC [60], resulting in 21 clusters of 454 contigs (Figure S6D).  The initial set of 89 chloroplast 454 contigs was
present in three neighboring clusters: Cluster 14, Cluster 17 and Cluster 21.  These clusters contained 122, eight and six contigs,
respectively, raising the number of identiﬁed chloroplast contigs assembled from the chloroplast-enriched fraction from 89 to 136
(‘‘chloroplast 454 contigs’’ in Table S3).  Of these, 71 contigs had no sequence similarity to known protein-coding genes, 36 contigs
harbored full-length chloroplast genes, 36 contigs harbored fragments of chloroplast genes, and 7 contigs harbored both fragments
and full-length CDSs of different chloroplast genes. 
Contigs potentially coding for chloroplast tRNAs and rRNAs were identiﬁed using Infernal 1. 1 [61].  The chloroplast 454 contigs
served as seeds for iterative contig extension with PRICE 1. 0. 1 [62].  Single-end 454 reads were used as false paired-end reads
with expected insert size equal to the median length of the 454 reads.  141 different combinations of parameters were tested in order
to optimize the contig extension.  None of the selected assemblies showed a length improvement for the initial set of chloroplast 454
contigs.  The length distribution of the chloroplast 454 contigs was consistent with the size of the LMW DNA fraction as estimated by
agarose gel electrophoresis of Boodlea genomic DNA (Figure 1D; Figure S6B). 
Repetitive regions in the contigs were identiﬁed with ‘einverted’, ‘etandem’ and ‘palindrome’ from the EMBOSS 6. 5. 7 [63] package. 
Dotplots for all contigs were generated with YASS v.  1. 14, using standard parameters [64].  Coverage of the chloroplast 454 contigs
was evaluated by mapping the 454 reads, the mRNA and the total-RNA libraries to these contigs with CLC Genomics Workbench 7. 0
(QIAGEN) (Figure S6C). 
The chloroplast 454 contigs were used together with HMW DNA reads for two independent hybrid assemblies.  First, we tried to
close hypothetical gaps between the chloroplast 454 contigs with the pbahaScaffolder. py script integrated in the smrtanalysis
2. 3. 0 pipeline [65].  Second, the pre-assembled chloroplast 454 contigs were used as anchors for HMW DNA reads in a round of
hybrid assembly with dbg2olc [66].  These analyses failed to close the hypothetical gaps between the short chloroplast 454 contigs
and did not yield longer contigs.  These results stand in stark contrast to the mitochondrial 454 contigs, where the same approaches
yielded markedly longer contigs (Figures S2F and S2G).

Since the hybrid assemblies with uncorrected reads could not reconstruct a circular chloroplast genome, HMW DNA reads were
further characterized after error correction.  The high-noise HMW DNA reads were corrected by applying a hybrid correction with
proovread 2. 12 [67] using 454 reads and reads from Illumina RNA-seq libraries (see below).  Corrected reads encoding chloroplast
genes were identiﬁed by aligning them against a custom protein database, named Chloroprotein_db, including genes from the picoPLAZA protein database [68] and protein-coding genes from published green algal chloroplast genomes (Chlorophyta sensu Bremer
1985, NCBI Taxonomy id: 3041). 
LMW DNA reads were self-corrected with the PBcR pipeline [69].  Since the LMW DNA size is unknown and PBcR requires an estimate of the genome size for proper read correction, six different putative genome sizes were tested (100 kb, 1 Mb, 2. 24 Mb, 10 Mb,
100 Mb).  The best performance in terms of number of corrected reads was obtained by the combination of ‘‘10 Mb’’ for the estimated
genome size and the –sensitive ﬂag turned on; these corrected reads were used for the downstream analysis.  After error correction,
the number of reads was reduced from 154,852 to 106,428 (Table S2), with a similar length distribution as the uncorrected reads
library (Figure S6A). 
In order to estimate the Boodlea chloroplast genome size, k-mer frequency distributions were calculated with jellyﬁsh 2. 0 [70]. 
K-mers ranging from 11 toto 47 were analyzed for uncorrected and corrected LMW DNA reads, for the ﬁltered 454 reads and for
the 454 reads that could be mapped on the chloroplast 454 contigs (Figure S3). 
De novo genome assembly of corrected LMW DNA reads was performed with the Celera WGS assembler version 8.
