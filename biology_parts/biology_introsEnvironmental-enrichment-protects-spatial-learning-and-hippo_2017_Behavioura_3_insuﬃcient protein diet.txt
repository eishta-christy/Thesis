Protein malnutrition is one of the most common health conditions,
aﬀecting human children during the most vulnerable stage of their
development [1].  Adequate nutrition during this critical period is an
essential factor that ensures the normal structural and functional development of the brain [2]; and while there is no doubt that all nutrients are essential for adequate neurodevelopment, proteins appear to
play the most critical role in this period [3].  An insuﬃcient protein diet
during brain development may result in maladaptive structural changes
and, consequently, behavioral deﬁcits [4–8]. 
The eﬀects of nutritional imbalance are aggravated when they occur
during brain development and there is evidence that the earlier the
malnutrition, the more severe, lasting, or permanent are its eﬀects on
brain maturation [9,10].
