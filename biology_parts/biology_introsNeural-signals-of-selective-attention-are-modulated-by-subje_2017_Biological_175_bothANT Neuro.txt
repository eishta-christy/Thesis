Recent evidence has shown that brain activity measured with the
event-related potentials (ERP) method co-varies with preferences for
consumer goods (Junghöfer Name, 2010; Pozharliev, Verbeke, Van
Strien, & Bagozzi, 2015; Schaefer, Buratto, Goto, & Brotherhood, 2016;
Telpaz, Webb, & Levy, 2015).  This is an important development in an
emerging ﬁeld – consumer neuroscience – that aims to investigate
consumer behaviour (CB) with neuroscience methods.  The results from
two of these studies (Telpaz Name, 2015; Junghofer Name, 2010) suggest
that early brain potentials (neural signals occurring less than 300 ms
after participants ﬁrst see the image of a consumer good) can index
consumer preferences. 
These results can be interpreted from the perspective of the “motivated attention” theoretical
framework (Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert,
1997; Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006), which contends that similar early
ERPs reﬂect automatic attentional processes towards motivationally
relevant stimuli (Olofsson, Nordin, Sequeira, & Polich, 2008; Schupp,
Flaisch Name, 2006; Walker Name, 2011).  However, a striking aspect of
ERP studies of CB is that they do not report consistent links between
consumer preferences and late ERP positivities, which are often

modulated by motivationally relevant stimuli (Olofsson Name, 2008),
and are thought to reﬂect post-perceptive and controlled selective attention processes (Schupp, Stockburger Name, 2006).  In order to investigate this issue, the primary goal of this study was to examine the
ERP correlates of consumer preferences with a particular focus on late
ERP positivities.  In the remainder of this section we brieﬂy review past
work on motivated attention processes and their electrophysiological
correlates.  We then review existing ERP studies of consumer behaviour
and provide an overview of the present study.

Motivated attention is classically separated in two subprocesses: A
quick, “preattentive” mechanism of attentional orientation; and a more1996;

processes by aﬀective-motivational factors can occur through two different routes.  First a “quick” route would involve subcortical structures
predominantly involved in the evaluation of motivational relevance
(e. g.  the amygdala; Pessoa & Adolphs, 2010; Schaefer Name, 2006). 
These structures would detect the presence of motivationally relevant
information in the environment through sensory inputs and would
subsequently modulate activity in sensory cortices through relatively
direct pathways (Vuilleumier & Huang, 2009).  This route is classically
thought to be automatic (Vuilleumier, Armony, Driver, & Dolan, 2001),
although evidence suggests that it can be modulated by top-down
controlled processes (Pessoa, McKenna, Gutierrez, & Ungerleider, 2002;
Pessoa, Padmala, & Morland, 2005). 
The second pathway of motivated attention is one in which neocortical networks (mainly frontal and parietal areas) receive inputs
conveying emotional information, and subsequently modulate sensory
cortices.  This mechanism is thought to be linked to overt and controlled
attentional processes (LeDoux, 1996; Vuilleumier & Huang, 2009).  Beyond the main theoretical distinction between a quick “preattentive”
and a slower overt attentional response, a third process is often proposed in which attentional resources would be allocated to motivationally-relevant stimuli in a temporally sustained manner.  This third
subtype of motivated attention would most likely involve working
memory (WM) processes and facilitate a more elaborative processing of
motivationally-relevant
information (Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006;
Watts, Buratto, Brotherhood, Barnacle, & Schaefer, 2014). 
scalp sites
ERP researchers have identiﬁed three types of brain potentials to
emotional pictures that map onto the three attentional subprocesses
described above.  As some of us explained in previous articles (Walker
Name, 2011; Watts Name, 2014), ERPs to stimuli of higher motivational
relevance (e. g.  emotional stimuli, faces, aﬀective stimuli) can be divided into three subtypes.  First, pre–400 ms ERPs to motivationally
relevant stimuli are thought to reﬂect a rapid and automatic orientation
of attention triggered by evolutionary and/or motivationally relevant
properties of external stimuli (Mavratzakis, Herbert, & Walla, 2016;
Olofsson Name, 2008; Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006).  Second, an ERP
called “Late positive potential” has often been observed after 400 ms
following the onset of a motivationally relevant stimulus.  This ERP is
characterised by a strong positivity that can be observed across the
entire scalp with maxima in posterior
(Codispoti,
Ferrari, & Bradley, 2007; Schupp Name, 2000).  The latencies of this effect vary across studies but they tend to be predominant between 400
and 800 ms (Codispoti, De Cesarei, & Ferrari, 2012).  The LPP is thought
to reﬂect overt, post-perceptive attentional responses to motivationallyrelevant stimuli that are more sustained in time and for which the involvement of controlled processes would be more important than the
pre–400 ms eﬀects (Codispoti Name, 2007; Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006;
Walker Name, 2011).  Third, a more sustained ERP positivity for motivationally relevant pictures has been observed after 800 ms post-stimulus onset.  This eﬀect consists of a sustained waveform that can last a
few seconds after stimulus onset (Diedrich, Naumann, Maier, & Becker,2006;
Hajcak & Olvet, 2008).  The topography of this eﬀect is often widely
distributed across the scalp over both fronto-central and centro-parietal
sites (Foti & Hajcak, 2008; Hajcak & Olvet, 2008).  These ERP eﬀects are
commonly labeled as positive slow waves (PSW) (Schupp, Flaisch Name,
2006) or as “late LPP” (Leutgeb, Schäfer, & Schienle, 2009; Schienle,
K & chel, & Leutgeb, 2011), and they are thought to reﬂect sustained
attentional processes related to the maintenance and potential manipulation of information in working memory (Schupp, Flaisch Name,Hajcak & Nieuwenhuis,
Foti & Hajcak,2.  Event-related brain potential studies of consumer behaviour
The vast majority of studies investigating the ERP correlates of
motivational relevance have used stimuli conveying an intrinsic emotional and evolutionary meaning, such as pictures of faces displayingif
that determines
emotional expressions or pictures of emotional scenes (e. g.  dead bodies,
scenes of violence and threat, etc. ).  It is not yet well established if these
results can be generalized to objects that have acquired their motivational relevance because of their economic value.  We deﬁne the economic value of an object as the computation of subjective beneﬁts andan object will be preferred (see
Levy & Glimcher, 2012; Montague & Berns, 2002).  The choice of acquiring an object is thought to be strongly determined by its economic
value (Padoa-Schioppa & Assad, 2006).  The evaluation of the economic
value of an object is thought to involve the assessment of the value of
several of its attributes, and this process can vary across diﬀerent types
of objects.  However, it is believed that the human brain can represent
this information into a “common scale” of value that allows comparing
between diﬀerent potential choices (Levy & Glimcher, 2012). 
Importantly, it has been suggested that the economic value of objects and
actions can be determined by a previous history of gains and losses that
can be understood from the perspective of reinforcement learning
models (Montague & Berns, 2002; Schaefer Name, 2016), although it is
often suggested that a number of contextual eﬀects can also modulate
these valuation processes (Kalwani, Yim, Rinne, & Sugita, 1990). al. ,2007;Consumer goods are typical examples of objects that have acquired
motivational relevance through their economic value, as the “desire to
own” (Knutson, Rick, Wimmer, Prelec, & Loewenstein, 2007) a consumer good is largely determined by an evaluation of its subjective
beneﬁts and costs (Kalwani Name, 1990; Knutson Name, 2007; Winer,
1986).  However, despite a recent surge of studies using neuroimaging
(Karmarkar, Shiv, & Knutson, 2014; Knutson Name, 2007; Plassmann,
O’Doherty, & Rangel,Bode, & Haynes, 2010) and psychophysiological methods (e. g.  Rasch,
Louviere, & Teichert, 2015; Walla, Brenner, & Koller, 2011) to investigate consumer behaviour, only a very limited number of studies
have approached this question using the ERP method.  Previous studies
that have examined ERPs related to preferences for consumer goods
have focused mainly on early (pre-400) ERPs.  For instance, Telpaz Name
(2015) found a relationship between the N200 component and product
preferences measured by a behavioural choice procedure in which
participants needed to choose between pairs of products.  Telpaz Name
(2015) suggested that this N200 eﬀect could reﬂect an eﬀect of the
Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN), an ERP component that overlaps
with the N200, and which has been linked to the evaluation of prediction errors
(Mushtaq, Wilkie, MonWilliams, & Schaefer, 2016), and more recently, to positive surprise and
buying preferences in a virtual shopping task (Schaefer Name, 2016). 
Furthermore, a study using magnetoencephalography (MEG) found that
early brain potentials (between 110 and 230 ms post-stimulus onset)
reﬂecting motivated attention were related to gender-speciﬁc preferences for consumer goods (Junghöfer Name, 2010). 
in decision-making tasks
Although these studies provide evidence in favour of the notion of
the involvement of early attentional responses in consumer preferences,
evidence regarding later eﬀects is scant and contradictory.  Pozharliev
Name’s (2015) study reported a relationship between the LPP and preferences for luxury goods only when participants were in a social
context, and Bosshard Name (2016), although not using pictures of
consumer goods, found a relationship between the LPP and the extent
to which brand names were liked.  In contrast to these studies, the work
by Telpaz Name (2015) described above did not ﬁnd eﬀects in the LPP or
in any later time window.  In addition, to our knowledge no study has
reported testing the relationship between the PSW and preferences for
consumer goods in a shopping context.  Furthermore, the apparent
contradiction between Telpaz Name (2015) and Pozharliev Name (2015)
regarding late positivities is diﬃcult to resolve as they used markedly
diﬀerent methods: First, Telpaz Name (2015) repeated the presentation
of every individual stimulus 50 times whereas Pozharliev Name (2015)
used single presentations for each item, which may have caused differences between these studies regarding potential habituation eﬀects
of late positivities (Ravden & Polich, 1998); Second, Telpaz Name (2015)

3.  Overview
Therefore, the primary goal of this study was to examine and
characterize the electrophysiological responses to consumer goods that
are preferred compared to less preferred goods using a wide diversity of
non-repeated consumer goods and a procedure that maximized motivational engagement.  In order to ﬁll an important gap in the literature,
we focused on the positive slow waves (PSW) and the LPP, but we also
tested the eﬀects of consumer preference on the amplitude of the N200
brain potentials in order to provide a comparison with previous research.  In order to attain this goal, we asked participants to take part in
a modiﬁed version of a shopping task used in previous studies (Knutson
Name, 2007; Plassmann Name, 2007; Schaefer Name, 2016).  In this task,
participants were shown pictures of familiar consumer goods, which
they could later purchase, and were asked to rate their level of preference towards each item while their scalp EEG was recorded. 
A secondary goal of this study was to verify if the same ERPs that
are modulated by preference ratings can also vary according to subsequent “purchasing” decisions, and whether any potential relationship
between ERPs and subsequent decisions can be accounted for by an
eﬀect of preference.  Therefore, we also categorized ERPs time-locked to
the viewing of consumer goods relative to whether participants decided
to buy them or not.  Finally, we tested if this Buy/No-Buy (BNB) eﬀect
on ERPs was still present when only products from a homogenous level
of subjective preference were considered, which would attenuate any
eﬀect of subjective preference.  If any potential eﬀect of BNB were still
observed in such circumstances, this could tentatively indicate that the
eﬀect of BNB decisions on ERPs can be dissociated from eﬀects of
subjective preferences. 
4.  Methods
4. 1.  Participants
Forty-ﬁve right-handed adults (24 females; mean age = 21. 64,
SD = 2. 77) with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders
participated in this experiment.  From this initial sample, seven participants were excluded because they did not have at least 16 artifact-free
trials in one of the three main conditions (“Low”, “Middle”, or “High”
preference: LP, MP, HP).  This criterion was used to make sure that all
ERP waveforms had an acceptable signal to noise ratio (Luck, 2005). 
The ﬁnal sample had 38 participants (22 females, mean age = 21. 49,
SD = 2. 76).  Participants were recruited from the student population of4. 2.  Stimuli
We used colour digital pictures of 180 products selected from local
shops and online retailers which were familiar to our participants.  The
average familiarity score reported by this study’s participants for the
products was 6. 51, SD = 1. 13, out of a scale ranging from 1 to 9.  It
should be noted that this score was signiﬁcantly higher than the midpoint of the scale (5), t = 8. 25, p < 0. 001 (two-tailed).  We also veriﬁed that the means of the familiarity ratings were higher than 5 separately for the three main conditions of the experiment: LP (M = 5. 77,
SD = 1. 72, t = 2. 75, p = 0. 009), MP (M = 6. 61, SD = 1. 02, t = 9. 77,
p < 0. 001), and HP (M = 7. 75, SD = 0. 68, t = 25. 03, p < 0. 001). 
These results indicate that the products used in this study were overall
familiar to our participants.  The products included a large variety of
items, such as electronics, food, drinks, sports equipment, and others. 
We provide examples of our digital pictures in the supplementary section (Supplementary Fig.  1).  The mean prices of the products, calculated as the mean of the prices of each product in two diﬀerent retailers,
ranged from 2. 35 to 66 Malaysian Ringgits
(RM, M = 24. 59,
SD = 17. 59) (based on the conversion rate at the time of data collection, in US dollars, this ranged from 0. 56 to 15. 84 USD). 
4. 3.  Behavioural paradigm
Participants sat in a comfortable chair at approximately 80 cm from
a 22” monitor on which the stimuli were displayed.  E-Prime 2. 0
(Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) was used to display the
stimuli on the screen.  We recorded participants’ scalp EEG while they
performed a virtual shopping task during which each participant was
shown a sequence of 180 products on the screen.  For each product, the
trial sequence included nine stages (depicted in Fig.  1): First, participants saw a ﬁxation (black cross on white screen) displayed for a
random duration (800–1700 ms).  Second, the image of a product was
shown on the computer screen for 3 s.  In the third, fourth, and ﬁfth
stages, pleasantness, wanting and familiarity were measured using selfreport items adapted from Schaefer Name (2016).  The items were “How
pleasant is the product to you? (1 = Very unpleasant, 9 = Extremely
pleasant)”, “How much do you want the product? (1 = I don’t want this
item at all, 9 = I really want this item)”, and “How familiar are you
with the product? (1 = Not familiar at all, 9 = Extremely familiar)”.  In
the sixth stage, a ﬁxation was again displayed for a random duration
(800–1700 ms).  In the seventh stage, the image of the product was
N.  Goto Name
Biological Psychology 128 (2017) 11–20
shown again with a price superimposed on it.  In the eighth stage,
participants saw a ﬁxation again for 1 s.  Finally (ninth stage), the price
superimposed on the image was shown again, and participants were
prompted to decide whether or not to buy the product at the oﬀered
price from a virtual allocation of RM100 (24 USD), which was reset for
every product (see Fig.  1).  At the end of the experiment, a computer
program randomly selected one of the products that were “bought” by
the participant.  This chosen product and “cash savings”, (the RM100
allocation minus the oﬀered price for the product) were given to participants later.  This approach was used to increase the motivational
engagement of the participants, and to maximize the likelihood that a
“true” economic value would be attributed to the goods (see Knutson
Name, 2007; Schaefer Name, 2016). 
and RM49. 5 (11. 88 USD)
In order to encourage participants to purchase products during the
experiment, oﬀered prices were discounted from the means of the
prices by 25%.  Thus, prices shown to participants ranged between
RM1. 76 (0. 42 USD)
(M = 18. 44,
SD = 13. 19).  Furthermore, we sought to minimize possible biases that
could be caused by strategies based on buying a minimal amount of
products.  To achieve this goal, and following previous research
(Schaefer Name, 2016), participants lost money on their ﬁnal cash
savings if they did not buy a minimum number of products, according
to a schedule previously explained to them.  If the number of bought
products were less than or equal to 18, RM30 (7. 2 USD) would be deducted from the savings.  If this number was between 19 and 24, RM15
(3. 6 USD) would be lost.  If the number was between 25 and 30, participants would lose RM3 (0. 72 USD) from their savings.  If participants
bought more than 30 products, they would not lose any money at the
end.  All of the aspects of the behavioural paradigm were explained to
participants before the experiment, and their understanding was conﬁrmed by a small quiz.  The experiment lasted approximately 2 h. 
4. 4.  Electrophysiological data recording and pre-processing
Each participant’s scalp EEG was recorded using 32 Ag/AgCl electrodes embedded in “Waveguard” purpose-made caps following the
standard 10–20 system of electrode locations and an “ASALAB” ampliﬁer (both manufactured by ANT Neuro, Enschede, Netherlands) at a
sampling rate of 512 Hz (DC–138 Hz bandwidth).  Impedance was kept
below 10 kΩ, and a common average reference was used during recording.
