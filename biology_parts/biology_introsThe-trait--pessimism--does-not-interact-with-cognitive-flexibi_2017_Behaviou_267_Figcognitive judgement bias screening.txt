The term pessimism (pessimistic judgement bias) refers to a ﬁxation
on the darker aspects of a situation or event, to the expectation of a
negative outcome, or to a lack of hope for the future [1,2].  Those who
tend towards pessimism may also feel helpless and believe that any
actions taken are unlikely to have an impact on their future.  The role of
pessimism has been emphasized in the aetiology of aﬀective disorders. 
In cognitive theories, information processing biases, including pessimistic judgement bias, are considered as a vulnerability factor for the
aetiology, maintenance and recurrence of depression [3–6].  This vulnerability has been conceptualized as a trait-like latent endogenous
process reactive to the eﬀects of stress, which reside in genetic, biological, and psychological variables [7].  However, to date, there have
been very few studies that directly support this theoretical claim.  Recent development of the ACI test, a task that can be used to measure
cognitive judgement bias (‘optimism’ and ‘pessimism’) in animals
[8–10], enabled the investigation of cognitive vulnerability to depression in an animal model. 
In our research, we assumed that in animals, similar to the case in
humans, cognitive judgement bias has components of both an enduring
trait and a transient state [11].  A trait represents a stable individual
diﬀerence in the level of pessimism/optimism that is generally experienced, whereas the state includes the pessimism/optimism that may
change on the basis of the situation or contextual factors.  Following this
assumption and on the basis of a number of ACI tests, we are now able
to isolate two groups of animals that signiﬁcantly and persistently diﬀer
in their cognitive judgement bias index over time.  In other words, we
are able to identify animals displaying stable and enduring ‘pessimistic’
and ‘optimistic’ traits. 
Recent research conducted in our laboratory revealed that the trait
‘pessimism’ in rats is linked with higher vulnerability to stress-induced
anhedonia [12].  We also demonstrated that ‘pessimistic’ rats are more
sensitive to negative performance feedback in the probabilistic reversallearning task [13] and less motivated to work for a reward in a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement [14].  Other studies revealed
the interrelation between the traits ‘pessimism’ and ‘optimism’ and
risky decision making in an animal model of slot machine gambling
where rats classiﬁed as ‘optimists’ were more likely to gamble for a
reward on clearly losing outcomes than were the ‘pessimists’ [15]. 
Another study, which assessed the inﬂuence of cognitive judgement
bias on decision-making under uncertainty, reported that ‘pessimistic’

rats take risks signiﬁcantly less often than their ‘optimistic’ counterparts
but that this only occurred in hopeless situations when the probability
of gaining a reward was extremely low [16]. 
One of the remaining unanswered questions is whether ‘pessimistic’/‘optimistic’ judgement bias could inﬂuence the way individuals
adjust their behaviour to changing aspects of the environment (cognitive ﬂexibility).  Such an interaction is not unlikely since deﬁcits in
cognitive ﬂexibility have been identiﬁed in psychiatric conditions that
are associated with pessimistic judgements [17–19]. 
One of the aspects of cognitive ﬂexibility that can be investigated
both in humans and in laboratory animals is their ability to initially
learn a rule and form an attentional set within the same stimulus dimensions and then to switch their attention to a new, previously irrelevant stimulus dimension.  This aspect of cognitive ﬂexibility, associated with aﬀective disorders and controlled by the prefrontal cortex
(PFC), is commonly assessed in humans using the Wisconsin Card
Sorting Test (WCST) [20] and in rats using the Attentional Set Shifting
Task (ASST) [21].  In the latter, the animals have to select a bowl
containing a food reward, based on their ability to discriminate the
odours and the media covering the bait.  The ASST requires rats to initially learn a rule and form an attentional set within the same stimulus
dimensions.  In the extra-dimensional (ED) shift, the crucial part of the
test, the subjects have to switch their attention to a new, previously
irrelevant stimulus dimension (e. g. , from the odours to the media
covering the bait).  The ED component is impaired by lesions of the
medial prefrontal cortex [21] as well as by chronic stress [22,23]. 
The present study was designed to investigate the interaction between cognitive judgement bias (‘optimism’/‘pessimism’) and cognitive
ﬂexibility in an animal model of depression based on chronic restraint
stress.  For this, ﬁrst, we trained and tested the rats in a series of ambiguous-cue interpretation tests, which allowed us to classify them as
‘optimistic’ or ‘pessimistic’.  Subsequently, the animals were re-trained
and re-tested on the ASST, which allowed evaluation of the diﬀerencescognitive ﬂexibility. 
Additionally, half of the ‘optimistic’ and half of the ‘pessimistic’ rats
were subjected to chronic (2 weeks) restraint stress and were re-evaluated using the ASST.

2. 1.  Ethics statement
These experiments were conducted in accordance with the NIH
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved
by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments at the Institute of
Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences. 
2. 2.  Subjects and housing
This study used 80 male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River,
Germany) weighing 175–200 g upon arrival.  The rats were group
housed (4 rats/cage) in a temperature-controlled room (21 ± 1 °C)
with 30–40% humidity under a 12/12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at
06:00 h).  In all of the experiments, the rats were mildly food restricted
to approximately 85% of their free-feeding weights.  This was achieved
by providing 15 g of food per rat per day (standard laboratory chow). 
The food restriction started 1 week prior to training.  Water was freely
available, except during the test sessions.  The behavioural procedures
and testing were performed during the light phase of the light/dark2. 3.  Ambiguous-cue interpretation test
2. 3. 1.  Apparatus
The behavioural tasks were performed in 24 computer-controlled
Skinner boxes (Med Associates, St Albans, Vermont, USA); each box wasequipped with light, a speaker, a liquid dispenser (set to deliver 0. 1 ml
of 5% sucrose solution), a grid ﬂoor through which scrambled electric
shocks (0. 5 mA) could be delivered, and 2 retractable levers.  The levers
were located at opposite sides of the feeder.  All of the behavioural
protocols, including the data acquisition and recordings, were programmed in Med State notation code (Med Associates).  The experimental procedures for the ACI test used in this study were modiﬁed
versions of the procedures previously described by Enkel and colleagues
[8] and have been described elsewhere [10]. 
2. 3. 2.  Behavioural training for the ACI test
2. 3. 2. 1.  Positive tone training.  During this phase, the rats were trained
to press the lever located on the left side of the feeder to receive the
sucrose solution when a tone (50 s, 2000 Hz at 75 dB sound pressure
level (SPL) or 9000 Hz at 75 dB SPL (counterbalanced)) signalled
reward availability.  Due to its association with a palatable reward,
this tone acquired a positive valence and was referred to as the “positive
tone,” and the associated lever was referred to as the “positive lever. ” A
reliable active lever pressing for the reward was achieved in 3 training
steps: a) presentations of the positive tone (each lasting 10 s) cooccurred with the delivery of the sucrose solution and were separated
by 10 s intertrial intervals (ITIs); b) presentations of the positive tone
co-occurred with a left lever extension and were followed by a 10 s ITI
(each lever press during the tone was continuously rewarded by sucrose
solution delivery); and c) was similar to (b) with the exception that
after the ﬁrst lever press and reward delivery, the tone was terminated
and followed by a 10 s ITI.  Each training session lasted for 30 min, and
the training sessions continued until the animals attained a stable
performance on each of the training steps (more than 80 responses
maintained over 3 consecutive training sessions during step b and a
minimum of 70% of responses to the positive lever following positive
tone presentation maintained over 3 consecutive sessions during step
c).  Positive tone training was followed by negative tone training. 
the presentation of
2. 3. 2. 2.  Negative tone training.  During this stage, the rats were trained
to press the lever located on the right side of the feeder to avoid an
electric shock (0. 5 mA, 10 s) when another tone (9000 Hz at 75 dB SPL
or 2000 Hz at 75 dB SPL (counterbalanced)) signalled a forthcoming
punishment.  Due to its association with a concomitant punishment, this
tone acquired a negative valence and was referred to as the “negative
tone. ” The associated lever was referred to as the “negative lever”.  A
reliable active lever press avoidance response was achieved in 2
training steps: a)
the negative tone was
accompanied by the occurrence of electric shocks unless the rat
pressed the right (negative) lever, which terminated the shock and
tone presentation, and b) the presentation of
the negative tone
preceded the occurrence of the electric shocks.  The delay from the
tone onset to the electric shock occurrence was progressively increased
from 1 s to 40 s.  Pressing the negative lever before the shock onset
terminated the tone and began a 10 s ITI (prevention response). 
Pressing the negative lever after the shock onset terminated the tone
and shock and was referred to as the “escape response. ” The maximum
duration of the tone/shock-application was 50 s (i. e. , 40 s of tone
presentation followed by 10 s of a tone/shock co-occurrence), and the
tone presentations were separated by 10 s ITIs.  Daily training sessions
consisted of 30 tone presentations.  The animals had to accomplish at
least 70% correct prevention responses maintained over 3 consecutive
training sessions, before proceeding to the discrimination training. 
2. 3. 2. 3.  Discrimination training.  During this phase, the rats were trained
to discriminate between positive and negative tones by responding to
the appropriate levers (as learned in the previous training stages) to
maximize reward and minimize punishment delivery.  The tones, which
consisted of 20 positive and 20 negative tones, were presented pseudorandomly and separated by 10 s ITIs.  Pressing the positive lever during
the positive tone presentation resulted in an instant reward delivery

and initiated the ITI.  Pressing the negative lever during the negative
tone presentation resulted in a negative tone termination and initiated
the ITI.  Pressing the wrong lever (e. g. , pressing the left lever instead of
the right lever in response to a negative tone presentation) as well as
escape responses or response omissions were considered failed trials. 
Animals had to achieve a minimum of 70% correct responses with each
lever, maintained over 3 consecutive discrimination sessions,proceed to the ACI test. 
2. 3. 3.  ACI testing
The ACI testing session consisted of 20 positive, 20 negative, and 10
intermediate (ambiguous) tone presentations.  The frequency of the
intermediate tones was set to 5000 Hz at 75 dB.  This frequency was
selected on the basis of the protocol described by Enkel and colleagues
[8] and was conﬁrmed to be intermediate in terms of the response
pattern in a pilot experiment (data not shown).  The tones were presented in a pseudo-randomized order and separated by 10 s ITIs.  Any
lever press during the ambiguous tone presentation terminated the tone
but had no consequences.  If the rat did not respond within 50 s of the
ambiguous tone presentation, the tone was terminated, and a response
omission was scored. 
During ACI testing, the responses to each tone (positive, ambiguous
and negative) were scored and analysed as the proportion of the overall
number of responses to a given tone.  The proportion of omissions was
analysed separately.  To calculate the cognitive bias index, the proportion of negative responses to the ambiguous cues was subtracted from
the proportion of positive responses, resulting in values ranging between −1 and 1, where values above 0 indicate an overall positive
judgement and ‘optimistic’ interpretation of the ambiguous cue. 
2. 3. 4.  Cognitive bias screening
To assess the cognitive judgement bias as a trait, individual rats
were examined in a series of 10 consecutive ACI tests, which were
performed at 3-day intervals.  On the basis of the average cognitive
judgement bias index obtained from these 10 ACI tests, the rats were
divided into 2 subgroups of ‘optimistic’ and ‘pessimistic’ animals.  The
animals that were classiﬁed as ‘optimistic’ had an average cognitive
judgement bias index equal or above 0, whereas the cognitive judgement bias index in the ‘pessimistic’ group was below 0. 
2. 4.  Attentional set shifting task
2. 4. 1.  Apparatus
Testing was conducted in a custom-made wooden apparatus (length
x width x height: 58 × 39 × 23 cm) with the grid ﬂoor and wooden
board dividing it
into two sections: one large waiting area
(30 × 36 cm) and a testing area (25 × 36 cm).  The testing area was
further divided into 2 sections (25 × 18 cm each).  During testing, one
glass bowl (8. 5 cm internal diameter, 3. 5 cm depth) was placed in each
section of the testing area.  A pair of cues along with two stimulus dimensions deﬁned each bowl.  To mark each pot with a distinct odour,
5 ml of a ﬂavouring essence (Dr.  Oetker, Poland) was applied to a piece
of blotting paper ﬁxed to the external rim of the pot immediately prior
to use.  A diﬀerent pot was used for each combination of digging
medium and odour; only one odour was ever applied to a given bowl. 
The bait (one-third of a Honey Nut Cheerio, Nestle®) was placed at the
bottom of the positive/rewarded bowl and buried in the digging
medium.  A small amount of powdered Cheerio was added to the digging medium in the second negative/non-rewarded bowl to prevent the
rat from trying to detect the buried reward by its smell. 
2. 4. 2.  Procedure
The procedure was adapted from Birrell and Brown [21] and Nikiforuk and Popik [23], and consisted of the following 3 steps:
Step 1, habituation: rats were habituated to the testing area and
trained to dig in the pots ﬁlled with sawdust to retrieve the foodreward.  Rats were transported from the housing facility to the testing
room, where they were presented with two unscented bowls (ﬁlled with
several pieces of Cheerios) in the experimental apparatus.  In the following trials, the rats learned to retrieve the reward from both of the
sawdust-ﬁlled baited bowls.  With each exposure, the bait was covered
with an increasing amount of sawdust. 
Step 2, training: rats were trained on a series of simple discrimination (SD) tasks to a criterion of six consecutive correct trials.  For
these trials, rats had to learn to associate the food reward with an odour
cue (e. g. , arrack vs.  orange, both pots ﬁlled with sawdust) and/or a
digging medium (e. g. , plastic balls vs.  pebbles, no odour).  All rats were
trained using the same pairs of stimuli.  The positive and negative cues
for each rat were presented randomly and equally.  These training stimuli were not used again in subsequent testing trials. 
Step 3, testing: rats performed a series of discriminations in a single
test session.  The ﬁrst four trials at the beginning of each discrimination
phase were a discovery period (not included in the six criterion trials). 
In subsequent trials, an incorrect choice was recorded as an error. 
On test days (pre-test and post-test), rats were required to perform
seven sequential stages of discrimination: a simple discrimination (SD),
a compound discrimination (CD), a ﬁrst reversal (REV1), an intradimensional discrimination (ID), a second reversal (REV2), an extradimensional discrimination (ED), and a ﬁnal reversal (REV3). 
In the simple discrimination involving only one stimulus dimension,
the pots diﬀered along one of two dimensions (e. g. , digging medium). 
For the compound discrimination (CD), the second (irrelevant) dimension (i. e. , odour) was introduced, but the correct and incorrect
exemplars of the relevant dimension remained constant.  For the reversal of this discrimination (Rev 1), the exemplars and relevant dimension were unchanged, but the previously correct exemplar was now
incorrect, and vice versa.  The intra-dimensional (ID) shift was then
presented, consisting of new exemplars of both the relevant and irrelevant dimensions, with the relevant dimension remaining the same as
before.  The ID discrimination was then reversed (Rev 2) such that the
formerly positive exemplar became the negative one.  For the extra-dimensional (ED) shift, a new pair of exemplars was again introduced, but
this time, a relevant dimension was also changed.  Finally, the last phase
was the reversal (Rev 3) of the ED discrimination.  The exemplars were
always presented in pairs and varied so that only one animal within
each treatment group received any given combination.  The assignment
of each exemplar in a pair as being positive or negative at a given phase
and the left-right positioning of the pots in the test apparatus on each
trial were randomized.  The latency to approach the experimental reward was measured for each trial.  The latency was deﬁned as the time
from lifting the wooden aperture opening the access to the testing area
to ﬁnding a reward (regardless of whether the rat made the correct or
incorrect choice).  Digging was deﬁned as any distinct displacement of
the digging media with either the paw or the nose; the rat could investigate a digging pot by sniﬃng or touching without displacing material.  Testing was continued in each phase until the rats reached the
criterion of six consecutive correct trials, after which testing proceeded
to the next phase.  Table 1 outlines the progressions through the ASST
phases during the pre-test and posttest, including exemplars of odours
and media used and their assignment into pairs. 
2. 5.  Experimental design and behavioural measures
The experimental design is schematically presented in Fig.  1.  After
attaining a stable discrimination performance (more than 70% correct
responses to each tone over 3 consecutive days), each rat was subjected
to the cognitive bias screening procedure as previously described.  After
establishing the ‘optimistic’ and ‘pessimistic’ traits in the individual
animals, the rats were re-trained for the ASST, given baseline testing on
the ASST and subsequently divided into 4 experimental groups: ‘Control-optimistic’,‘Stressed-pessimistic’.  The ‘optimistic’ and ‘pessimistic’ animals were

discriminations: simple discrimination (SD), compound discrimination (CD), reversal 1

exemplars from the irrelevant dimension (i. e. , at the CD phase of the pretest, the chaplets
were paired with either mango or lavender odour, etc. ).  In the ID and ED, there were

assigned to the experimental groups in a way that the stressed rats were
kept only with other stressed animals and controls were kept only with
other controls.  This resulted in relatively random distribution of the
‘optimistic’ and ‘pessimistic’ traits across experimental groups. 
‘Stressed-optimistic’ and ‘Stressed-pessimistic’ groups of animals
were subjected to chronic restraint stress.  The stress paradigm consisted
of 1 h daily immobilization sessions that were performed over 2 consecutive weeks.  Rats were transferred from a housing facility to the
stress room and then separated into the test room.  The animals were
placed into perforated plastic tubes (6. 5 cm inner diameter) of adjustable length.  The restraint permitted normal breathing and limited
movements of the head and limbs.  Control animals were handled daily
throughout the experiment. 
To assess the eﬀects of chronic stress and cognitive judgement bias
on cognitive ﬂexibility, we tested the rats in the ASST paradigm twice
− before (pretest) and after the 2 weeks of stress or handling procedures (posttest). 
All of the ACI testing was automated and did not require blind
testing.  An experimenter blind to the experimental groups performed
the ASST. 
2. 6.  Statistics
The data were analysed using SPSS (version 20. 0, SPSS Inc. ,
Chicago, IL, United States).  Distribution of the cognitive bias index data
was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.  Diﬀerences in the processing of the ambiguous-cue and the positive and negative tones between the ‘optimistic’ and ‘pessimistic’ animals subjected to chronic
restraint stress or control handling were investigated using 4-way

Cognitive judgement bias (2 levels: ‘optimistic’ and ‘pessimistic’) and
Stress (Control and Stressed) and the within-subject factors of Lever (2
levels: positive and negative) and Tone (3 levels: positive, ambiguous
and negative).  Diﬀerences between experimental groups in the number
of trials required to reach criterion during separate phases of the pretest
and posttest ASST and diﬀerences between experimental groups in the
reward-approach latency during separate phases of the pretest and
posttest ASST were investigated using 4 way ANOVA with the betweensubject factors of Cognitive judgement bias (2 levels: ‘optimistic’ and
‘pessimistic’) and Stress (Control and Stressed) and the within-subject
factors of Test (2 levels: pretest and posttest) and Discrimination phase
(7 levels: SD, CD, Rev 1, ID, Rev 2, ED, Rev 3). 
For pair-wise comparisons, the values were adjusted using Sidak’s
correction factor for multiple comparisons [24].  All of the tests ofBehavioural Brain Research 335 (2017) 199–207

signiﬁcance were performed at α = 0. 05.  Homogeneity of variance was
conﬁrmed using Levene’s test.  For repeated-measures analyses, the
sphericity was also veriﬁed using Mauchly’s test.  The data are presented
as the mean ± SEM. 
<Conclusion> Results. 
Rats that showed lack of progress during ACI training sessions
(N = 4 during the negative tone training stage and N = 18 during the
discrimination training stage) were excluded from the analysis.  Fiftyeight rats reached the criterion of at least 70% correct responses with
each lever, maintained over three consecutive ACI discrimination sessions, and thus qualiﬁed for cognitive bias screening.  Of those rats,
forty-nine animals reached the criteria for the ASST and were tested
after chronic stress or handling procedures.  Among those, ﬁve were
‘pessimistic' (OI < 0) and four were ‘optimistic' (OI ≥ 0). 
Four more rats were excluded from the experiment based on ROUT
analysis of outliers for the latency data.  Out of four excluded outliers,
two belonged to the Control ‘optimistic’ group and another two to the
Stressed ‘pessimistic’ group. 
The average cognitive bias index of all of the rats that entered the
ﬁnal part of the experiment, established on the basis of the cognitive
bias screening, was −0. 107 ± 0. 46. 
The distribution of the cognitive bias index data was normal
(Z = 0. 101, N = 49, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). 
3. 1.  ‘Optimistic’ vs.  ‘pessimistic’ animals
Results of the cognitive bias screening enabled the separation of two
groups of animals, which were clearly distinct in the interpretation of
the ambiguous cues over time: ‘optimistic’ (N = 17, AVG cognitive bias
index ≥ 0) and ‘pessimistic’ (N = 28, AVG cognitive bias index < 0). 
The animals that were classiﬁed as ‘optimistic’ had an average cognitive
bias index ranging from 0. 00 to 0. 48, whereas the cognitive bias index
in the ‘pessimistic’ group ranged from −0. 02 to −0. 80. ‘optimistic’‘pessimistic’judgement
Further analysis revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the pattern of
responses(Lever × Tone × Cognitive
interaction
(F(2,82) = 25. 94, p < 0. 001)).  Compared with their ‘optimistic’ counterparts, ‘pessimistic’ animals responded signiﬁcantly less often to the
positive lever and more often to the negative lever in response to the
ambiguous tone (p < 0. 001, Fig.  2A and B).  The ‘pessimistic’ animals
also responded less often to the positive lever in response to the positive
tone (p < 0. 05, Fig.  2B). 
‘Optimistic’ and ‘pessimistic’ rats did not diﬀer in the number of
omissions made (no signiﬁcant eﬀect of cognitive bias or cognitive
bias × tone interaction (F(2,82) = 2. 55, NS, Fig.  2C)). 
Although the cognitive bias index ﬂuctuated in both groups of animals (signiﬁcant main eﬀect of test (F(9,369) = 2. 56, p < 0. 01)), the
diﬀerences between ‘optimistic’ and ‘pessimistic’ groups did not signiﬁcantly change across the screening period (no signiﬁcant test × cognitive judgement bias interaction; highest F(9,369) = 0. 85, NS) indicating stability of the traits (Fig.  3). 
Following the cognitive judgement bias screening, the animals were
‘optimistic’ (N = 8),
assigned to 4 experimental groups: Control
stressed ‘optimistic’ (N = 10), Control
‘pessimistic’ (N = 15) and
Stressed ‘pessimistic’ (N = 16).  The size of the groups was determined
by the numbers of ‘optimistic’ and ‘pessimistic’ animals and the cage
distribution of stressed animals (stressed rats were caged only with
other stressed individuals).
