In Brief
Berson Name show that TDP-43, a protein
associated with ALS and FTD, impairs the
stress response by interfering with the
chromatin remodeling protein Chd1 in
ﬂies and CHD2 in mammalian cells.  In
turn, animals expressing TDP-43 are
hypersensitive to various types of
stressors, indicating that this impairment
may promote neurodegeneration. 
Highlights
d TDP-43 cripples the stress response
d TDP-43 impairs nucleosomal dynamics and the induction of
heat shock genes
d TDP-43 physically interacts with ﬂy Chd1 and human CHD2
d Reduced levels of human CHD2 protein are observed in
frontotemporal dementia
