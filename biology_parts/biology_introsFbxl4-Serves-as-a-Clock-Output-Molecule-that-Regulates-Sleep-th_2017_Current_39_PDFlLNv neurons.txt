https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 10. 052The timing of sleep is tightly governed by the circadian clock, which contains a negative transcriptional
feedback loop and synchronizes the physiology and
behavior of most animals to daily environmental
oscillations.  However, how the circadian clock determines the timing of sleep is largely unclear.  In vertebrates and invertebrates, the status of sleep and
wakefulness is modulated by the electrical activity
of pacemaker neurons that are circadian regulated
and suppressed by inhibitory GABAergic inputs. 
Here, we showed that Drosophila GABAA receptors
undergo rhythmic degradation in arousal-promoting
large ventral lateral neurons (lLNvs) and their expression level in lLNvs displays a daily oscillation.  We also
demonstrated that the E3 ligase Fbxl4 promotes
GABAA receptor ubiquitination and degradation and
revealed that the transcription of fbxl4 in lLNvs is
CLOCK dependent.  Finally, we demonstrated that
Fbxl4 regulates the timing of sleep through rhythmically reducing GABA sensitivity to modulate the
excitability of lLNvs.  Our study uncovered a critical
molecular linkage between the circadian clock and
the electrical activity of pacemaker neurons and
demonstrated that CLOCK-dependent Fbxl4 expression rhythmically downregulates GABAA receptor
level to increase the activity of pacemaker neurons
and promote wakefulness. 
INTRODUCTION
Sleep is an essential and evolutionarily conserved behavior from
worms to humans [1, 2].  It is tightly governed by two independent
processes: the circadian clock that determines the timing of
sleep and the homeostatic mechanism that controls the amount
and depth of sleep [1, 3].  The circadian clock contains a negative
transcriptional feedback loop to synchronize the physiology and
behavior of most animals to daily environmental oscillations
[4–6].  The timing of sleep can be thought of as an output of the
circadian clock.  Several molecules, such as melatonin, prokineticin 2, and WAKE, have been identiﬁed as clock output molecules that regulate the timing of sleep [7–9]. 
The circadian clock also regulates the electrical activity of
pacemaker neurons, which modulate the status of sleep and
wakefulness [10–13].  In vertebrates and invertebrates, the circadian clock drives antiphase oscillations of sodium and potassium conductance to control the daily cycling of membrane
potential in pacemaker neurons [14].  It also drives rhythmic transcription of several ion channels in the mammalian suprachiasincluding L- and T-type Ca2+ channels, BK
matic nucleus,
channels, and K2P K+ channels [15, 16].  Conversely, the electrical activity of pacemaker neurons is suppressed by inhibitory
GABAergic inputs, the major source of inhibitory signaling for
mammalian CNS and Drosophila arousal-promoting large
ventral lateral neurons (lLNvs) [11, 17–19].  In Drosophila, lightdriven arousal is induced by the release of pigment dispersing
factor (PDF) from lLNv neurons [11, 20, 21], whose activity is
circadian regulated and suppressed at night by inhibitory
GABAergic inputs [20–23].  WAKE has been shown to act as a
clock output molecule to upregulate the level of the GABAA receptor Resistant to dieldrin (RDL) and promote its localization
to the cell surface at dusk [9], which indicates that the RDL level
is oscillated in lLNvs to synchronize with inhibitory GABAergic inputs and sleep behavior.
