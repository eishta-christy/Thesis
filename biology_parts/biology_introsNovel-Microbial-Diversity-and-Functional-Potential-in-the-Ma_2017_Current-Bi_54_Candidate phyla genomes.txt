previously uncharacterized microbes

https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 10. 040The vast majority of bacterial diversity lies within
phylum-level
lineages called ‘‘candidate phyla,’’
which lack isolated representatives and are poorly
understood.  These bacteria are surprisingly abundant in the oral cavity of marine mammals.  We employed a genome-resolved metagenomic approach
to recover and characterize genomes and functional
potential from microbes in the oral gingival sulcus of
two bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus).  We detected organisms from 24 known bacterial phyla and
one archaeal phylum.  We also recovered genomes
from two deep-branching, previously uncharacterized phylum-level lineages (here named ‘‘Candidatus
Delphibacteria’’ and ‘‘Candidatus Fertabacteria’’). 
The Delphibacteria lineage is found in both managed
and wild dolphins; its metabolic proﬁle suggests
a capacity for denitriﬁcation and a possible role in
dolphin health.  We uncovered a rich diversity of predicted Cas9 proteins, including the two longest predicted Cas9 proteins to date.  Notably, we identiﬁed
the ﬁrst type II CRISPR-Cas systems encoded by
members of the Candidate Phyla Radiation.  Using
their spacer sequences, we subsequently identiﬁed
and assembled a complete Saccharibacteria phage
genome.  These ﬁndings underscore the immense
microbial diversity and functional potential that await
discovery in previously unexplored environments. 
INTRODUCTION
The vast majority of bacterial diversity is found within phylumlevel
lineages that lack isolated representatives [1], commonly
referred to as ‘‘candidate phyla. ’’ Candidate phyla constitute at
least 103 out of approximately 142 widely recognized bacterial
phyla for which there is genomic representation [1–3]; 46% of
known bacterial phyla are clustered in the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR).  However, there remain many phylum-level bacterial
lineages that have no genomic representation and are not yet
formally recognized [4].  Genome-resolved metagenomic studies
offer unique and unprecedented insights into the biology of these
uncultured, poorly understood lineages and their biochemical
diversity [3–8].  In addition to revealing the environmentally and
economically important roles played by such bacteria, these
studies contribute greatly to our understanding of the distribution
of lifestyles across the tree of life.  For example, genomes from
members of the CPR suggest that they are metabolically sparse
and lack many biosynthetic pathways typically required for life,
presumably because these organisms are dependent on other
microbes for survival
[6, 9].  Candidate phyla genomes may
also reveal novel functional diversity, as phylogenetic diversity
is correlated with novel proteomic diversity and biological properties [10, 11]. 
Marine mammals are an ecologically important group of
animals harboring little-explored microbial communities.
