Diﬃculties in social-emotional processing are believed to play an
important role both in the onset and maintenance of anorexia nervosa
(AN) (Treasure, Corﬁeld, & Cardi, 2012; Treasure & Schmidt, 2013).  A
wide range of anomalies in social-emotional processing and reactivity
to emotional stimuli have been documented in people with acute AN
(Bora & Köse, 2016; Caglar-Nazali Name, 2014; Davies Name, 2016). 
Furthermore, longitudinal cohort studies have reported that diﬃculties
in social cognition and social communication at admission are important predictors of poor treatment outcome at 3- to 18-year follow-up
(Nielsen Name, 2015; Speranza, Loas, Wallier, & Corcos, 2007).  Thus,
these diﬃculties may contribute to the maintenance of the illness and
further understanding of these processes is of importance. 
Behavioural studies have documented diﬃculties in a range of different aspects of social-emotional processing in acute AN (Bora & Köse,
2016; Caglar-Nazali Name, 2014; Davies Name, 2016).  Some experimental studies have suggested diﬃculties in explicit processing of social-emotional cues, such as recognition of facial expressions, in AN
(Caglar-Nazali Name, 2014; Oldershaw Name, 2011).  However, more
recent studies have suggested that these diﬃculties may be driven by
anomalies in interpretation and reactivity to social-emotional cues in
AN (Ambwani Name, 2015; Dapelo, Surguladze, Morris, & Tchanturia,
2016).  Indeed, people with AN perceive emotionally provoking stimuli
to be more negative and colder than healthy comparison (HC) participants (Ambwani Name, 2015; Cardi Name, 2014).  Additionally, relative
to HCs, people with AN display reduced facial aﬀect in response to
emotionally provoking stimuli (Davies Name, 2016).  Taken together,
these ﬁndings suggest that there may be speciﬁc anomalies in implicit
processing and reactivity to social-emotional cues in AN and further
exploration of the neural mechanisms that underlie these processes may
be of interest. 
Few studies have examined the neural processes that underlie difﬁculties in social-emotional processing and reactivity to emotional stimuli in people with AN.  A recent review reported reduced response in
prefrontal regions, including the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex
(PFC), while viewing social behaviour in acute AN (McAdams & Smith,
2015).  Further, one of the included studies found that reduced response
in the lateral and medial PFC to social behaviour at admission to
treatment was associated with poorer outcome at discharge (SchulteRüther, Mainz, Fink, Herpertz-Dahlmann, & Konrad, 2012).  A recent
study investigating implicit processing of happy faces of increasing
intensity found greater linear increase in activation of the fusiform
gyrus in people with acute AN relative to HCs.  Another study, using a more
explicit task, found reduced amygdala response in people recovered
from AN relative to HCs in response to negative facial expressions when
the faces were coupled with the congruent emotion label (Bang,
Ro, & Endestad, 2016).  Despite the relative paucity of research in this
ﬁeld, these ﬁndings suggest possible anomalies in the recruitment of
frontal, amygdala, and visual attentional regions in social-emotional
processing in AN. 
More work has been conducted in anxiety and mood disorders,
which are common comorbid disorders in AN and share similar diﬃculties in social-emotional processing and reactivity to emotional stimuli (Davies Name, 2016; Hambrook, Brown, & Tchanturia, 2012;
Treasure, Stein, & Maguire, 2015).  A recent meta-analysis found that
relative to HCs, people with depression showed hyperactivation of regions associated with appraisal including amygdala, insula, and fusiform gyrus, during implicit processing of negative facial aﬀect
(Groenewold, Opmeer, de Jonge, Aleman, & Costafreda, 2013).  Additionally, increased activation of these regions was associated with
reduced recruitment of regions associated with emotion down-regulation, including the lateral PFC (Groenewold Name, 2013).  Similarly,
people with generalised and social anxiety disorders show reduced
activation of lateral PFC and associated hyperactivation of the amygdala when processing negative emotional stimuli including negative
facial expressions (Mochcovitch, da Rocha Freire, Garcia, & Nardi,
2014).  Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that there may be a
deﬁcit in prefrontal down-regulation and limbic up-regulation of negative emotion associated with depression and anxiety. 
The aim of the current study was to examine the neural substrates
employed during implicit processing of positively and negatively valenced facial expressions in AN and HC participants.  Based on the
neuroimaging ﬁndings outlined above, we hypothesised that participants with AN would have atypical pattern of reduced recruitment of
lateral PFC while processing emotional faces.  Further, based on previous work conducted in mood and anxiety disorders as well as behavioural work in AN, we hypothesise that participants with AN would
show a pattern of activation suggestive of anomalies in emotional reactivity.  Speciﬁcally, we hypothesise that relative to the HCs, participants with AN would show increased activation in the amygdala, insula, and fusiform gyri while processing the emotionalexpressions.

 Participants. 
Forty right-handed females participated in the study.  Twenty participants had a current DSM-IV diagnosis of AN, which was conﬁrmed
using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis – Researcher
Version (Spitzer, Williams, Gibbon, & First, 1992).  Fifteen participants
with AN were recruited from the community through advertisements
posted on eating disorder charity websites (i. e.  BEAT and Succeed).  The
AN participants recruited from the community were not receiving
psychological treatment during the time of the study.  Five participants
with AN were recruited from the Bethlem Royal Hospital, South London
and Maudsley NHS Trust and were receiving treatment during the
study.  60% of the participants with AN were taking antidepressants
during the time of the study, 45% of the AN participants reported comorbid depression and 25% reported comorbid anxiety disorder. 
Twenty age-matched HC women of healthy weight were recruited from
the community and amongst King’s College London students and staﬀ. 
The exclusion criteria for all participants were a history of head
trauma, hearing or visual impairment, neurological disease, MRI incompatibility, acute suicidality, and history of (or current) alcohol or
drug abuse.  Additionally, HC participants were screened with the
Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis − Researcher Version
(Spitzer Name, 1992) and were excluded if they had current or a history
of psychiatric disorders.  HC participants were also excluded if did not
have BMI between 18. 5 and 25. 0 or were taking psychotropic medication.  All participants gave a written, informed consent prior to taking
part in the study and were compensated for their participation.  The
study was approved by a National Research Ethics Service committee
(approval number: 11/LO/0373) and was conducted in accordance
with the latest version of Declaration of Helsinki. 
2. 2.  Questionnaire measures
The eating disorders examination questionnaire (EDEQ)
(Fairburn & Beglin, 1994), a 36-item self-report measure, was used to
assess eating restraint, eating concern, shape concern, and weight
concern over the past 28 days. 
The depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS)
(Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995), a 21-item self-report measure, was used
to assess depression, anxiety, and stress over the past two weeks. 
2. 3.  Design and procedure
During a 6-min event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) task participants were presented with black and white images of
faces (Fig.  1).  The face stimuli consisted of prototypical happy (intensity:
100%), prototypical fearful (intensity: 100%), and neutral faces.  The
stimuli were selected from a standardised set of facial expressions
(Ekman & Friesen, 1976), and consisted of ten diﬀerent adults displaying
each of the selected emotions (5 female and 5 male).  Happy and fearful
faces were used as they have previously been found to strongly capture
participants’ attention and produce robust activation of the amygdala,
fusiform gyrus, insula, and prefrontal regions (Fusar-Poli Name, 2009;
The happy, fearful, and neutral faces were presented one at a time for
2000 milliseconds (ms) during which participants identiﬁed the gender of
each face.  Faces were preceded by a ﬁxation cross the presentation of
which was jittered between 1000 and 6000 ms. 
Lundqvist & Ohman, 2005; Williams & Mattingley, 2006).  Additionally,
unlike angry or disgusted faces, fearful faces are not considered to be
indicative of direct threat (Hunnius, de Wit, Vrins, & von Hofsten, 2011). 
The neutral faces were used as a baseline comparison condition to allow
investigation of neural responses to facial aﬀect. 
Twenty happy, fearful, and neutral faces were presented in a
pseudo-randomised order.  The faces were presented one at time for
2000 ms followed by an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) ﬁxation cross.  The
ISI was varied between 1 and 6 s.  To ensure participants were attending
to the stimuli, they were asked to identify the gender of the faces by
pressing the appropriate buttons.  This is a paradigm frequently employed to investigate implicit social-emotional processing (Stuhrmann,
Suslow, & Dannlowski, 2011). 
2. 4.  Image acquisition and pre-processing
Magnetic resonance images were acquired using GE Signa 1. 5 T
scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) at the Centre for
Neuroimaging Science, King’s College London.  An 8-channel headcoil
was used to transmit and receive the radio frequency signal.  T2* –
weighted images depicting blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal
were acquired using an interleaved ascending acquisition order with a
repetition time of 2 s with 40 ms echo time and an 80° ﬂip angle.  Whole
brain coverage was acquired in 30 slices with 4 mm slice thickness and
0. 4 mm slice gap.  180 T2* – weighted whole brain volumes were acquired with
3. 75 mm × 3. 75 mm. 
Additionally, high-resolution sagittal T1–weighted structural images
(MP-RAGE) were acquired with a repetition time of 8. 592 ms.  The echo
time was 3. 8 ms with an 8° ﬂip angle.  Whole brain coverage was acquired in 180 slices with an in-plane resolution of 1. 25 mm × 1. 25 mm,
and 1. 2 mm slice thickness and 1. 2 mm slice gap.

Prior to analysis, the fMRI data was pre-processed using SPM8
(Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, Institute of Neurology,
London) implemented in Matlab 2015b (Mathworks, Natick, Mass. ). 
Pre-processing involved slice-timing and volume-to-volume head motion correction.  The data was then co-registered to a high-resolution
DARTEL template, created out of the participants T1–weighted structural images (Ashburner, 2007), and normalised to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space.  The data was spatially smoothed using an
8 mm FWHM three-dimensional isotropic Gaussian kernel. 
2. 5.  Statistical analysis
2. 5. 1.  Questionnaire and behavioural data
Questionnaire and behavioural data were analysed with Stata 14
(StataCorp.  2015, College Station, TX: StataCorp LP. ).  Due to skewed
nature of the questionnaire data, group diﬀerences were investigated
with nonparametric median Chi2 tests.  Prior to analysis, gender identiﬁcation accuracy data was transformed with arcsine and square root
transformation to allow further analysis under the general linear model
framework.  The gender identiﬁcation accuracy and reaction time data
were then analysed with a bootstrapped mixed model (1000 repetitions).  Trial (fearful, happy, neutral) and group (AN, HC) were entered
as ﬁxed eﬀects variables with a random intercept.  Signiﬁcant eﬀects
and interactions were further investigated by calculating post-hoc
contrasts and pair-wise comparisons.  P < 0. 05 was considered signiﬁcant. 
2. 5. 2.  Neuroimaging data
On subject level, each participant’s fMRI data were analysed under
the general linear model framework in SPM 8.  A canonical haemodynamic response function was used to model the BOLD signal for each of
the following conditions: happy faces, fearful faces, and neutral faces. 
The time-series was adjusted for head motion using the Friston 24parameter model (Friston, Williams, Howard, Frackowiak, & Turner,
1996) and low-frequency drift was ﬁltered out using high-pass ﬁlter set
to 1/128s.  To investigate relative activation or deactivation in response
to fearful and happy facial expressions compared to neutral faces, the
following contrast images were generated for each participant: fear >
neutral and happy > neutral. 
Each participant’s contrast images were then entered into group
level analysis, which was conducted with the Robust Regression
toolbox (http://wagerlab. colorado. edu/tools) implemented in Matlab
2015b (Wager, Keller, Lacey, & Jonides, 2005).  The Robust Regression
toolbox uses iteratively re-weighted least squares (IRLS) to increase
statistical power and reduce the impact of extreme outliers (Fritsch
Name, 2015; Wager Name, 2005).  We chose this method to reduce the
likelihood of false ﬁndings due to presence of extreme outliers that
could arise from head motion, scanner related artefacts, or individual
participants who were substantially diﬀerent from the rest of the
sample during the time of the MRI scan. 
The contrast images were ﬁrst entered into region of interest (ROI)
IRLS analyses to test a priori hypotheses.  The WFU Pickatlas toolbox in
SPM 8 was used to create the following ROI masks: bilateral amygdala,
bilateral insula, bilateral fusiform gyri, and bilateral lateral PFC.  To
investigate group diﬀerences within these regions, group status was
added as a contrast-coded covariate (1, −1: AN, HC).  Thus, positive test
statistic indicates greater activation in the AN group relative to the HC
group and negative test statistic indicates greater activation in the HC
group relative to the AN group.  The ROI ﬁndings were corrected for
multiple comparisons with a voxel-wise nonparametric permutation
test with 10000 iterations (α < 0. 05).  The permutation test uses the
max T distribution to generate a new corrected t-threshold each voxel
must reach to be considered signiﬁcant. 
We, additionally, explored whether the mean activation in the signiﬁcant ROIs correlated with medication status, BMI, DASS total score,
duration of illness, and eating disorder psychopathology as measured
by EDEQ within the AN group.  The correlations were conducted by
extracting mean signal change from the signiﬁcant ROIs in each contrast as recommended by Vul, Harris, Winkielman, and Pashler (2009). 
Nonparametric Spearman’s rho correlations were then conducted with
Matlab 2015b and p < 0. 01 was considered signiﬁcant following
correction for multiple comparisons. 
Finally, we also conducted an exploratory whole brain analysis to
investigate if signiﬁcant group diﬀerences were present in any further
regions outside of the a priori ROI masks.  As above, the contrast images
were entered into whole brain IRLS analysis with group status was
added as a contrast-coded covariate (1, −1: AN, HC).  The whole brain
ﬁndings were corrected for multiple comparisons with voxel level False
Discovery Rate (FDR) set at q < 0. 05.  Eﬀect size, and lower and upper
bound 99. 9% conﬁdence interval maps were generated using the EScalc(http://restfmri. net)
(Gao & Zang, 2015).

3. 1.  Clinical characteristics
The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the groups are
presented in Table 1.  There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in age or
years of education between the AN and HC participants.  As expected
the participants with AN had signiﬁcantly lower BMI and reported
signiﬁcantly more eating disorder psychopathology, depression, anxiety, and stress than the HC participants. 
3. 2.  Gender identiﬁcation
Gender identiﬁcation mean reaction times and accuracy are presented in Table 2.  There was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the groups
in gender identiﬁcation RTs, with the HC participants being signiﬁcantly faster to identify the gender of the faces than the participants
with AN. 
In gender identiﬁcation accuracy, there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between trials with all participants being signiﬁcantly more accurate in
the happy trials than fearful or neutral trials (Z = 2. 37, p = 0. 018, 95%
CI [0. 005, 0. 05]; Z = 2. 73, p = 0. 006, 95% CI [0. 01, 0. 04]).  There
were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in accuracy between neutral and fearful
trials across participants (Z = 0. 33, p = 0. 742, 95% CI [-0. 02, 0. 03]). 
There was also a signiﬁcant eﬀect of group and a signiﬁcant trial x
group interaction (Table 2).  Post-hoc tests revealed that HC participants
were signiﬁcantly more accurate than the participants with AN only in
the fearful trials (Z = 2. 64, p = 0. 008, 95% CI [0. 01, 0. 09]), but not in
the happy (Z = −1. 42, p = 0. 155, 95% CI [-0. 04, 0. 01]) or neutral
trials (Z = 1. 27, p = 0. 205,95% CI [-0. 01,0. 04]). 
3. 3.  Regions of interest ﬁndings
3. 3. 1.  Happy > neutral faces
The ROI ﬁndings are presented in Fig.  2 and Table 3.  There was a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in BOLD signal change between groups in recruitment of the right posterior insula while viewing happy > neutral
faces (Fig.  2A, Table 3).  Inspection of the contrast parameter estimates
revealed that there was simultaneous BOLD signal increase in the right
posterior insula in the AN group and BOLD signal decrease in the
posterior insula in the HC group in this contrast (Fig.  2A).  No further
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between groups were found in the amygdala,
fusiform gyri, or lateral PFC in this contrast. 
Additionally, within the AN group, the mean BOLD signal change in
the insula ROI did not signiﬁcantly correlate with medication status,

The ROI ﬁndings revealed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the AN
and HC groups in BOLD signal change in left amygdala in response to

contrast.  Inspection of the peak parameter estimates revealed that thereGender identiﬁcation mean reaction times and accuracy. 
was a relative increase BOLD signal in the left amygdala and VLPFC in
response to the fearful expressions in the HC group, but not in the AN
group (Fig.  2B,C).  No further signiﬁcant diﬀerences between groups
were found in the insula or fusiform gyri in this contrast. 
Additionally, within the AN group, the mean BOLD signal change in
the VLPFC or amygdala ROIs did not signiﬁcantly correlate with medication status, duration of illness, psychopathology, or BMI in this
contrast (Supplementary Table 1). 
3. 4.  Whole brain ﬁndings
The exploratory whole brain analysis did not reveal any regions of
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in BOLD signal change between groups within
the happy > neutral or fearful > neutral contrasts.  The eﬀect size
maps revealed regions of activation with large eﬀect sizes in response to
fearful > neutral and happy > neutral faces in the AN > HC group
contrast (Supplementary Fig.  1, Supplementary Fig.  2).  However, these
regions did not survive whole brain voxel level correction. 
<Conclusion> Discussion. 
The aim of the current study was to investigate anomalies in the
neural substrates employed during implicit processing of positive and
negative emotional facial expressions in AN.  There was a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between groups in the recruitment of left VLPFC and the
amygdala while processing fearful facial expressions, with the HCs
showing signiﬁcantly increased activation in both of these regions
while the participants with AN did not.  Additionally, we found a signiﬁcantly increased activation of the right posterior insula in the AN
group relative to the HC group while viewing happy facial expressions. 
No group diﬀerences were found in the fusiform gyri in response to
fearful or happy facial expressions.  Similarly, no group diﬀerences were
found in the exploratory whole brain analysis. 
The current ﬁndings revealed reduced activation of the left amygdala
in the people with AN relative to the HCs while processing fearful facial
expressions.  Regarding the HCs, these ﬁndings are in line with previous
work showing that healthy individuals show an elevated amygdala response to negative emotional facial expressions during both implicit and
explicit tasks (Fitzgerald, Angstadt, Jelsone, Nathan, & Phan, 2006; Hung
Name, 2010; Sato, Yoshikawa, Kochiyama, & Matsumura, 2004).  Additionally, previous studies in AN have reported reduced recruitment of
the amygdala in people who had recovered from AN relative to HC
participants in an explicit facial emotion processing task (Bang Name,
2016).  Thus, these ﬁndings suggest that blunted amygdala response to
negative facial aﬀect in AN may be trait-like anomaly that persist after
recovery. 
The current ﬁndings also showed reduced recruitment of the left
VLPFC in participants with AN relative to the HCs, in response to fearful
facial expressions.  Increased activation of the VLPFC in healthy individuals has been found in studies where participants are presented with
negative facial expression or neutral facial expressions in negative context
(Kim Name, 2004; Marumo, Takizawa, Kawakubo, Onitsuka, & Kasai,
2009; Taylor, Eisenberger, Saxbe, Lehman, & Lieberman, 2006).  In AN,
reduced frontal response to emotional facial expression has been
previously reported in an EEG study, which found reduced frontal P300,
while viewing negative facial expressions.  Additionally, reduced activation of lateral
and medial PFC regions has been reported in AN while viewing positive
and negative social behaviour (McAdams & Smith, 2015).  Such reduced
PFC reactivity has also been associated with poorer general clinical outcome at 1-year follow-up (Schulte-Rüther Name, 2012).  These ﬁndings
highlight the importance of atypical activation of these regions in acute
AN and suggest that this could contribute to illness maintenance.
