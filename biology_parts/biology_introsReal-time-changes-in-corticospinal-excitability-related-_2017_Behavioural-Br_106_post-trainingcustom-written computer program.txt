Motor imagery is deﬁned as the mental execution of an action
without any physical movement or muscle activation [1].  Brain activity
patterns during motor imagery are similar to those during the corresponding physical execution; the primary motor cortex (M1), premotor
cortex, supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and basal ganglia are
activated during motor imagery [2–7].  In addition, many studies have
reported signiﬁcant improvement of motor skills in patients with stroke
as well as in healthy persons after motor imagery training [8–10].  Because force control is always needed to perform a motor activity, motor
imagery training must somehow act on the neural substrates of force
control.  Thus, understanding the detailed eﬀects of motor imagery on
the neural substrates of force control is important for developing a

better rehabilitative strategy involving motor imagery. 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method
used to assess human corticospinal excitability.  The increase in cortical
excitability is evidenced by an increase in motor evoked potential
(MEP) amplitude, and a reduction in the motor threshold of the stimulation [11,12].  Studies using TMS, which has good temporal resolution, have revealed increased corticospinal excitability during
imagination of target muscle contraction without actual contraction
[13–16].  Furthermore, Mizuguchi Name [17] reported that changes in
corticospinal excitability during such motor imagery were related to the
imagined force level.  Stinear and Byblow [18] noted that motor imagery of phasic thumb abduction temporally modulated excitability in
M1, speciﬁc to the representation of the intrinsic hand muscle. 
These previous studies have suggested that corticospinal excitability
during motor imagery is modulated in a force level- and time-dependent manner.  However, in many of these studies, the timing of the
corticospinal excitability that was investigated using TMS was more
closely related to the period during which tonic muscle contraction was
imagined.  In daily life, force control is ﬁnely tuned.  Force needs to be
increased or decreased with a high degree of control in order to accomplish a ﬁne-motor task.  To our knowledge, no study has yet attempted to examine how motor imagery changes corticospinal excitability during the increasing and decreasing phases of force control.  We
hypothesized that corticospinal excitability at such times would gradually increase or decrease, respectively, with the modulation of force. 
Such a ﬁnding would provide new insights into the mechanism underlying the real-time modulation of cerebral cortical activity according
to the state of motor imagery.  The aim of this study was therefore to
examine the real-time changes in corticospinal excitability that occur
during motor imagery in a task requiring isometric force control.

2. 1.  Participants
Ten healthy volunteers (three men and seven women, all righthanded, age range: 20–30 years, mean age: 22. 7 ± 3. 4 years) participated in the present study.  None of the participants had any history of
impairments in terms of neuromuscular or physical function that may
have aﬀected task performance.  This study was performed in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Kanagawa University of
Human Services (Approval Number: HODAI 7–12).  All participants
provided written informed consent prior to their participation in the2. 2.  Electromyography
Electromyography (EMG) of the right extensor carpi radialis (ECR)
and right ﬂexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle was recorded using pairs of
surface Ag/AgCl electrodes placed over these muscles in a belly − tendon montage.  The signal was ampliﬁed and ﬁltered (band pass
5–3000 Hz) using a bioelectric ampliﬁer (Neuropack MEB-2200; Nihon
Kohden Corp. , Tokyo, Japan), digitized at 4000 Hz, and stored for
oﬄine analysis on a laboratory computer (Power Lab system; AD
Instruments Pty Ltd. , New South Wales, Australia). 
2. 3.  Experimental paradigm
The protocol adopted herein has been described in a previous study
[19].  Brieﬂy, the participants sat comfortably on a chair with their right
forearms pronated at 45° and positioned horizontally over a table.  Before initiating the experiment, we measured the force produced in wrist
dorsiﬂexion when each subject performed maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of the ECR against a plate that had a strain gauge
(Kyowa Electronic Instruments Co. , Tokyo, Japan) mounted to theFig.  1.  Experimental design of a force tracking task. 
Participants were instructed to adjust the isometric force of wrist joint dorsiﬂexion to
keep a dot on a target tracking line on a monitor, while the dot moved from the left to
right at a constant speed.  During the performance test and the imagery test, no visual
feedback was provided during tracking of the sine wave (fore generation phase).  MVC;

vertical portion of the plate.  The analog signal was ampliﬁed (SA-250
STRAIN AMPLIFIER; TEAC, Tokyo, Japan), ﬁltered, and digitized (NI
USB-6229 BNC; National Instruments Corp. , Austin, TX). 
For the motor task, the participant was instructed to adjust the
isometric force during right wrist dorsiﬂexion while watching a PC
monitor that displayed a moving dot and a tracking line.  The dot automatically moved horizontally from left to right at a constant speed
(6 cm/s), but moved vertically according to the amount of dorsiﬂexion
force exerted, such that the height of the dot was determined by the
magnitude of the force generated.  A force-tracking line was presented
on the monitor as a sine wave with horizontal lines at both ends (see
Fig.  1).  The horizontal (ﬂat) line indicated zero force.  At the beginning
of the task, the participants relaxed while the dot was moving from left
to right on the horizontal line.  Then, participants exerted (Increasing
phase) and reduced (Decreasing phase) contractile force such that the
dot was continuously maintained on the line of the sine wave; they then
relaxed again (i. e. , zero force) after the dot had passed over the sine
wave.  The peak of the wave, representing the target peak force during
the task, was set at 30% of the wrist dorsiﬂexion MVC. 
The experimental protocol is shown in Fig.  2.  The experiment
consisted of three sessions: the training session, which was used to
construct the mental task image by motor learning and two test sessions, including the performance test and imagery test.  In the training
session, the participants repeatedly performed the motor task described
above with actual muscle contraction in order to construct the motor
imagery.  Training consisted of four blocks, and each block was composed of 10 trials. 
In the performance test, the participants performed the actual motor
task without visual feedback; the target waveform and the dot disappeared at the time the contraction started.  To describe the learning
curve needed to guarantee imagery construction, a performance test
consisting of 10 trials each was carried out at three time points: before
training (pre-training), and after the second and fourth training blocks
(post-training). 
For the imagery test, the participants performed the task without
physical muscle contraction, and with no visual feedback, as per the
performance test.  Participants were instructed to imagine using force
control similar to that used during training.  During imagery, it was
conﬁrmed that there was no muscle contraction by monitoring the
EMG.  The imagery tests, consisting of 50 trials each, were carried out
before training and after the fourth training block (post-training).  A
