in recognizing others’ emotional expressions
Facial expressions of emotion represent a crucial component of
interaction, allowing the observer to infer another's
human social
emotional state (Frith, 2009; Keltner, 2003), and adjust their behaviour
accordingly (Blair, 2003).  Children and adults aﬀected by disorders of
social and aﬀective functioning, including psychopathy, often show
diﬃcultiesO’Kearney, McKone, & Palermo, 2012; Marsh & Blair, 2008).  When categorizing expressions, attention is typically directed toward criticalthe mouth
(Eisenbarth & Alpers, 2011; Wells, Gillespie, & Rotshtein, 2016).  A
failure to attend to these regions may lead to diﬃculties in judging the
expressed emotion.  Although psychopathic traits in children and nonoﬀenders are associated with atypical eye scan paths for emotional
faces (Dadds, El Masry, Wimalaweera, & Guastella, 2008; Gillespie,
Rotshtein, Wells, Beech, & Mitchell, 2015), these relationships are yet to
be tested in a forensic sample. and

Psychopathy is best understood as a collection of personality traits
that vary along a continuum in the general population (Coid, Yang,
Ullrich, Roberts, & Hare, 2009).  These traits include elevated levels of
antisocial behaviour, a callous disregard for others, and a deceitful and
manipulative interpersonal style (Hare, 2003), and are often prominent
in clinical and forensic samples (Skeem, Polaschek, Patrick, & Lilienfeld,
2011).  A triarchic conceptual framework describes psychopathy along
three core dimensions
that have been reliably identiﬁed and
distinguished in clinical and non-clinical samples, namely Boldness,
Meanness, and Disinhibition (Patrick, Fowles, & Krueger, 2009).  Boldness refers to psychologically adaptive traits emphasised by Cleckley
(1941), and includes venturesomeness, fearlessness, and interpersonal
dominance (Patrick Name, 2009).  Boldness explains a key diﬀerence
between psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder [ASPD] (Wall,
Wygant, & Sellbom, 2015), and contributes over and above Meanness
and Disinhibition to the prediction of clinical psychopathy (Venables,
Hall, & Patrick, 2014).  Meanness entails a callous disregard for others,
empathy problems, and a tendency toward exploiting others
(Drislane & Patrick, 2016).  The Disinhibition dimension refers to impulse control problems, emotional reactivity, poor behavioural restraint, and irresponsibility (Patrick Name, 2009). 
Several prominent accounts of psychopathy emphasise the presence
of emotion recognition impairments in relation to the fearless and unempathic features (e. g. , Boldness, Meanness) of the disorder (Blair,
2005, 2008; Moul, Killcross, & Dadds, 2012).  These diﬃculties have
been observed among adult male psychopaths, and in relation to the
broader psychopathy phenotype in both adults and children (Blair
Name, 2004; Dolan & Fullam, 2006; Dadds Name, 2008; Hastings,
Tangney, & Stuewig, 2008; Kosson, Suchy, Mayer, & Libby, 2002;
Prado, Treeby, & Crowe, 2015).  Although it is theorized by Blair (2005,
2008) that impairments in recognizing others distress cues (fear and
sadness) are of particular importance in psychopathy, a recent metaanalysis suggests that these diﬃculties are pervasive across fear, sad,
happy, and surprise emotional expressions (Dawel Name, 2012).

Neurobiologically inspired models of psychopathy propose that the
disorder is characterized by functional impairments in areas related to
emotion processing, including the amygdala (Blair, 2008), and the extended limbic system (Kiehl, 2006).  Support for these models comes
from studies that have shown a reduced amygdala response to fearful
expressions in both adults and children/adolescents with increasing
(Decety, Skelly, Yoder, & Kiehl, 2014; Jones,

The successful decoding of diﬀerent emotional expressions depends
on visual attention toward emotionally salient aspects of the face, most
notably the eyes and the mouth (Eisenbarth & Alpers, 2011; Smith,
Cottrell, Gosselin, & Schyns, 2005; Wells Name, 2016).  The precise
pattern of eye movements is thought to be dependent upon the emotion
expressed, and attention is often guided toward the most diagnostic
facial features for a given emotion (e. g. , the widened eye whites of
fearful expressions) (Schurgin Name, 2014; Smith Name, 2005; Wells
Name, 2016).  While attention to these regions is likely to be modiﬁed by
conscious control, even brieﬂy presented faces trigger very early, potentially reﬂexive eye movements toward diagnostic regions of the face
(Gamer & Büchel, 2009; Scheller, Büchel, & Gamer, 2012).  Again, reﬂexive eye movements in these studies were more commonly toward
the eyes than away from the eyes, and varied with the type of expression.  Psychopathy related impairments in emotion recognition may
therefore reﬂect reduced attention to the eye region of emotional faces.
