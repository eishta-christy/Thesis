in recognizing others’ emotional expressions
Facial expressions of emotion represent a crucial component of
interaction, allowing the observer to infer another's
human social
emotional state (Frith, 2009; Keltner, 2003), and adjust their behaviour
accordingly (Blair, 2003).  Children and adults aﬀected by disorders of
social and aﬀective functioning, including psychopathy, often show
diﬃcultiesO’Kearney, McKone, & Palermo, 2012; Marsh & Blair, 2008).  When categorizing expressions, attention is typically directed toward criticalthe mouth
(Eisenbarth & Alpers, 2011; Wells, Gillespie, & Rotshtein, 2016).  A
failure to attend to these regions may lead to diﬃculties in judging the
expressed emotion.  Although psychopathic traits in children and nonoﬀenders are associated with atypical eye scan paths for emotional
faces (Dadds, El Masry, Wimalaweera, & Guastella, 2008; Gillespie,
Rotshtein, Wells, Beech, & Mitchell, 2015), these relationships are yet to
be tested in a forensic sample. and

Psychopathy is best understood as a collection of personality traits
that vary along a continuum in the general population (Coid, Yang,
Ullrich, Roberts, & Hare, 2009).  These traits include elevated levels of
antisocial behaviour, a callous disregard for others, and a deceitful and
manipulative interpersonal style (Hare, 2003), and are often prominent
in clinical and forensic samples (Skeem, Polaschek, Patrick, & Lilienfeld,
2011).  A triarchic conceptual framework describes psychopathy along
three core dimensions
that have been reliably identiﬁed and
distinguished in clinical and non-clinical samples, namely Boldness,
Meanness, and Disinhibition (Patrick, Fowles, & Krueger, 2009).  Boldness refers to psychologically adaptive traits emphasised by Cleckley
(1941), and includes venturesomeness, fearlessness, and interpersonal
dominance (Patrick Name, 2009).  Boldness explains a key diﬀerence
between psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder [ASPD] (Wall,
Wygant, & Sellbom, 2015), and contributes over and above Meanness
and Disinhibition to the prediction of clinical psychopathy (Venables,
Hall, & Patrick, 2014).  Meanness entails a callous disregard for others,
empathy problems, and a tendency toward exploiting others
(Drislane & Patrick, 2016).  The Disinhibition dimension refers to impulse control problems, emotional reactivity, poor behavioural restraint, and irresponsibility (Patrick Name, 2009). 
Several prominent accounts of psychopathy emphasise the presence
of emotion recognition impairments in relation to the fearless and unempathic features (e. g. , Boldness, Meanness) of the disorder (Blair,
2005, 2008; Moul, Killcross, & Dadds, 2012).  These diﬃculties have
been observed among adult male psychopaths, and in relation to the
broader psychopathy phenotype in both adults and children (Blair
Name, 2004; Dolan & Fullam, 2006; Dadds Name, 2008; Hastings,
Tangney, & Stuewig, 2008; Kosson, Suchy, Mayer, & Libby, 2002;
Prado, Treeby, & Crowe, 2015).  Although it is theorized by Blair (2005,
2008) that impairments in recognizing others distress cues (fear and
sadness) are of particular importance in psychopathy, a recent metaanalysis suggests that these diﬃculties are pervasive across fear, sad,
happy, and surprise emotional expressions (Dawel Name, 2012).

Neurobiologically inspired models of psychopathy propose that the
disorder is characterized by functional impairments in areas related to
emotion processing, including the amygdala (Blair, 2008), and the extended limbic system (Kiehl, 2006).  Support for these models comes
from studies that have shown a reduced amygdala response to fearful
expressions in both adults and children/adolescents with increasing
(Decety, Skelly, Yoder, & Kiehl, 2014; Jones,
psychopathic traits
Laurens, Herba,
Barker, & Viding,
Cardinale,
VanMeter, & Marsh, 2014). 2009;
The successful decoding of diﬀerent emotional expressions depends
on visual attention toward emotionally salient aspects of the face, most
notably the eyes and the mouth (Eisenbarth & Alpers, 2011; Smith,
Cottrell, Gosselin, & Schyns, 2005; Wells Name, 2016).  The precise
pattern of eye movements is thought to be dependent upon the emotion
expressed, and attention is often guided toward the most diagnostic
facial features for a given emotion (e. g. , the widened eye whites of
fearful expressions) (Schurgin Name, 2014; Smith Name, 2005; Wells
Name, 2016).  While attention to these regions is likely to be modiﬁed by
conscious control, even brieﬂy presented faces trigger very early, potentially reﬂexive eye movements toward diagnostic regions of the face
(Gamer & Büchel, 2009; Scheller, Büchel, & Gamer, 2012).  Again, reﬂexive eye movements in these studies were more commonly toward
the eyes than away from the eyes, and varied with the type of expression.  Psychopathy related impairments in emotion recognition may
therefore reﬂect reduced attention to the eye region of emotional faces. 
In support of this hypothesis, children with elevated callous-unemotional (CU) traits, referring to the aﬀective dimension of psychopathy, show impaired fear recognition and a reduced number and
length of ﬁxations on the eye region (Dadds Name, 2008).  When instructed to ﬁxate the eye region, these children showed normalized
levels of performance (Dadds Name, 2008).  A similar pattern of performance has also been observed in a patient with bilateral amygdala
dysfunction (Adolphs Name, 2005), and is taken as support for amygdala
based models of psychopathy.  More recent evidence from non-offending adult males has shown that the interpersonal and aﬀective
features of psychopathy are associated with reduced attention to the
eyes, and that the number of ﬁxations on the eye region is positively
correlated with fear accuracy (Gillespie, Rotshtein, Wells Name, 2015). 
Another study with non-oﬀenders has shown that equivalent measures
of Boldness, but not Meanness, are associated with reduced face exploration during a face perception task (Boll & Gamer, 2016). 
In the present study we examined eye scan paths for emotional faces
among adult male violent oﬀenders, and assessed the relationship of
distinct psychopathic traits with attention to the eyes.  For comparison
we also recruited a community control group of non-oﬀending adult
males.  Because psychopathy consists of a number of positively related
dimensions, suppressor eﬀects in statistical analyses may obscure understanding of the unique correlates of distinct psychopathic traits. 
Thus, we aimed to model these dimensional traits simultaneously in a
way that can account for their covariance (Hicks & Patrick, 2006; Lozier
Name, 2014).  We also measured levels of negative aﬀect, including
anxiety and depression, as diﬀerences in emotional face processing and
attentional allocation have been observed in these disorders (Buckner,
Maner, & Schmidt, 2010; Easter Name, 2005; Kohler, Hoﬀman, Eastman,
Healey, & Moberg, 2011).  One earlier study suggests that psychopathy
primarily aﬀects the perception of moderate intensity expressions
(Hastings Name, 2008).  Therefore in the current experiment we manipulated the intensity of the emotional expression by morphing each
prototypical expression (100%) with the neutral expression of the same
person.  Thus, participants classiﬁed expressions at 90% and 55% intensities (see Gillespie, Rotshtein, Wells Name, 2015; Gillespie,
Rotshtein, Satherley, Beech, & Mitchell, 2015; Gillespie, Mitchell,
Satherley, Beech, & Rotshtein, 2015; Wells Name, 2016). 
We predicted that the preference for information form the eye region would be absent among violent oﬀenders, and that they would
show an absence of stimulus driven eﬀects on eye scan paths.  Moreover,we predicted that distinct psychopathic traits related to a lack of empathy and fearlessness, namely Meanness and Boldness, would be associated with a pattern of impaired emotion recognition, and reduced
attention to the eyes relative to the mouth.  We tested these relationships across various parameters of attention to the eyes and the mouth:
overall dwell time, ﬁxation count, and ﬁrst ﬁxation time.  The analyses
focused on the average response across all emotions, and also speciﬁcally on the processing of fearful expressions, given ﬁndings that the
eye region is of particular importance for recognizing fear (Smith Name,
2005; Whalen Name, 2004).  Furthermore, at least one prominent theory
of psychopathy proposes that psychopaths are characterized by particular deﬁcits in recognizing others distress cues (Blair, 2005, 2008).

2. 1.  Participants
Thirty male violent non-sex oﬀenders, aged between 32 and 50
years (M = 35. 1, SD = 11. 8), were recruited from HMP Grendon, UK. 
All participants had normal or corrected to normal vision.  The majority
of participants were White Caucasian (n = 19, 63%).  Index oﬀences
included, but were not limited to, murder (n = 17) or attempted
murder (n = 2), and wounding with intent (n = 3).  Case ﬁle histories
showed that no participants had a pre-diagnosed mental health problem, although one participant was taking antidepressant medication. 
The number of any previous convictions ranged from 0 to 31 (M = 9,
SD = 10), and the number of previous violent convictions ranged from
0 to 14 (M = 2, SD = 3).  All participants signed their fully informed
consent.  Ethical approval for the study was granted by the University of
Birmingham Committee for Ethical Review, and access was approved
by the National Oﬀender Management Service for England and Wales,
and the HMP Grendon Research Advisory Group. 
Eye movement data were also collected from an approximately age
matched community control group of 25 adult males, aged 18–69 years
(M = 37. 88, SD = 18. 29), to assess the typicality of the eye movements
observed in the violent oﬀender sample.  The comparison group was
recruited from the community using online advertisements and participants received a monetary payment for taking part.  None of the
control group participants reported a history of convictions for either
violent or sexual oﬀences.
