Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly, characterized by a decline in
cognitive functions.  Sporadic AD (sAD; i. e. , late-onset AD), the most
frequent form of AD with an unknown etiology, presents early abnormalities in brain glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, thus
resulting in an insulin-resistant state in the brain, which has been
suggested to be related to etiological events in its pathogenesis [1,2]. 
Additionally, protein aggregates [3], mitochondrial dysfunctions [4],
oxidative stress [5], neuroinﬂammation [6], brain cholinergic deﬁcits
[7], and dysfunctions in adult neurogenesis [8–10] are among the main
features of
sAD.  These features may be modeled by a intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of low, subdiabetogenic doses of
streptozotocin (STZ) in rodents [11,12] and non-human primates [13]. 
Adult neurogenesis is a multi-step process of the formation of new
neurons in the mammalian brain throughout life.  Evidence suggests
that newly generated neurons play a crucial role in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory (e. g. , spatial memory and orientation)
and recovery from neuronal injury [14].  Neurogenesis starts from the
proliferation of resident neural stem cells (NSC) and neural progenitor
cells (NPC) in two neurogenic niches in the central nervous system
(CNS): the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles (LVs), and
the subgranular zone (SGZ) ofthe dentate gyrus (DG) of

hippocampus.  The process of adult neurogenesis can be inﬂuenced by
many intrinsic and extrinsic factors.  Growth factors and neurotrophins,
such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
increase diﬀerentiation, maturation, and survival of proliferating NSC/NPC, stimulating neurogenesis.  In contrast, microglial activation and release of
proinﬂammatory cytokines (e. g. , interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) have been demonstrated to inhibit neurogenesis by reducing the proliferation of NSC/NPC.  The consequence of
inhibiting neurogenesis is cognitive deﬁcit, reﬂected by impairments in
spatial and recognition learning and memory [15].  Several studies have
reported an increase in neuroinﬂammation in the STZ model of sAD,
reﬂected by reactive gliosis and an increase in proinﬂammatory markers that are associated with cognitive decline [16–19].  Other studies
reported a decrease in neurogenesis associated with oxidative stress
[20] or amyloid pathology [21]. 
Current therapeutic options for AD are limited because most agents
provide only symptomatic relief from cognitive deﬁcits.  A neuroprotective agent able to improve cognitive function along with slowing
neuronal loss, decrease neuroinﬂammation and improve neurogenesis
is needed.  Curcuma longa (turmeric) is a rhizomatous native plant from
South and Southeast Asia which belongsZingiberaceae [22].  Traditionally curcumin, the main active ingredient
in turmeric, has been used as a common food additive and herbal
medicine [23].  Epidemiological studies have suggested that societies
that widely use curcumin have a reduced incidence of AD and improved
cognitive function [24,25]. 
to the ginger
The natural polyphenol curcumin possesses pleiotropic properties.  It
has been reported to provide neuroprotection in cellular and animal
models of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders including
AD, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, depression, and schizophrenia [26].  Neuroprotection provided by curcumin may be due to its antioxidant properties, by upregulation of the
transcription factor Nrf2 [27], and anti-inﬂammatory properties, by
suppression of NF-κB activation [28].  Curcumin also inhibits amyloid
beta (Aβ)-oligomerization and tau-phosphorylation [29] and increases
BDNF levels in corticosterone-treated rats [30], chronically stressed rats
[31] and Wistar Kyoto rats [23]. 
In addition, curcumin potentiates spatial and non-spatial memory in
aged mice [32] and rats [33], in Aβ-induced [34] and STZ-induced
models of AD [35–38].  The positive eﬀects of curcumin on cognition
may be related to its capacity to enhance neurogenesis.  Curcumin has
shown to increase neurite outgrowth and proliferation of NSC both in
vitro and in vivo through the activation of the ERK and MAP kinase
pathways [39,40].  Curcumin treatment
increases neurogenesis in
chronically stressed rats [41], aged rats [33] and in Aβ-induced model
of AD [26].  Nevertheless, the eﬀects of prolonged curcumin treatment
on adult neurogenesis were not studied in the STZ-ICV model of sAD. 
Therefore, we hypothesized that curcumin treatment would be able to
preserve cognitive functions of STZ-ICV injected rats by increasing
adult neurogenesis and decreasing neuroinﬂammation. 
<Middle> Methods. 
2. 1.  Animals
In this study, 3–4 months old male Wistar rats weighing 300–340 g
at the beginning of the experiment were used.  All animals were obtained from our breeding colony.  The animals had free access to food
and water, were maintained in a temperature-controlled room
(22 °C ± 2 °C) on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 AM),
and were randomly housed in groups of 3–4 in polypropylene cages
with wood shavings as bedding.  The studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal University of Paraná and
were approved by the University Ethics Committee (protocol no.  735). 
Fig.  1.  Experimental design.  The present study was designed to assess the eﬀects of
prolonged curcumin treatment in three diﬀerent doses (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) on shortterm spatial and recognition memory, neuroinﬂammation and adult neurogenesis in rats
that received a single bilateral ICV injection of STZ.  IHC, immunohistochemistry; OFT,

2. 2.  Drugs
Streptozotocin (N-[methylnitrosocarbamoyl]-α-D-glucosamine) was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and
curcumin (from Curcuma longa) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. 
Louis, MO, USA). 
2. 3.  Experimental design
The rats were randomly divided into ﬁve groups: sham (n = 7), STZ
(n = 7), STZ + curcumin 25 mg/kg (STZ + cur 25; n = 6), STZ
+ curcumin 50 mg/kg (STZ + cur 50; n = 8), and STZ + curcumin
100 mg/kg (STZ + cur 100; n = 7).  The STZ groups received a single
bilateral ICV injection of STZ (3 mg/kg total dose) dissolved in sterile
0. 9% saline (4. 5 μl per injection site).  The sham group received a single
bilateral ICV injection of sterile 0. 9% saline (4. 5 μl per injection site;
Fig.  1).  Treatment with curcumin (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, per os) or its
vehicle (0. 5% carboxymethylcelulose in distilled water with 1% Tween
80) was performed over 30 days, once a day in the afternoon, and
started 1 h before the beginning of stereotaxic surgeries. 
The animals were allowed to recover for 3 weeks following surgery
before behavioral evaluations.  These animals were assessed in the open
ﬁeld test (OFT) to evaluate spontaneous locomotor activity on day 21
after surgery and in the elevated plus maze (EPM) on day 22 to assess
anxiety-like behavior.  Cognitive performance was evaluated in the
object location test (OLT) on day 28, in the object recognition test
(ORT) on day 29, and in the spatial version of the Y maze on day 30. 
Right after the last behavioral analysis, blood glucose levels were
measured using a G-Tech Free device using blood samples that were
collected by tail prick. 
i. p. ) and intracardially perfused for posterior
Afterward, animals were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate
(400 mg/kg,
immunohistochemical evaluation of Doublecortin (DCX; a marker of
newborn and migrating neurons), Ki-67 (a marker of cell proliferation),
ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule (Iba-1; a marker of microglia), and glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP; a marker of astrocytes). 
2. 4.  Stereotaxic surgery
The animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium thiopental
(30 mg/kg, i. p. ) and chloral hydrate (150 mg/kg, i. p. ) and placed in a
stereotaxic frame (David Kopf, USA).  The skull was exposed, and the
following stereotaxic coordinates for the LVs, according to Paxinos and
Watson [42], were calculated: anterior/posterior, −0. 8 mm from
bregma; medial/lateral, ± 1. 5 mm from the midline; dorsal/ventral,
−3. 8 mm from the skull.  A hole was drilled through the skull, and a 28gauge stainless steel needle was manually lowered into each LV.  An
electronic pump (Insight, Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil) was used to controlT. B.  Bassani Name
the ﬂow of the injections at a rate of 1. 0 μl/min over 4. 5 min.  At the end
of the injections, the needle was left in place for an additional 2 min to
avoid reﬂux.  The lesioned group received bilateral ICV injections of STZ
(3 mg/kg total dose) dissolved in sterile saline (4. 5 μl per injection site)
into the LVs.  Sham surgery followed the same procedure, but the same
volume of sterile saline was injected instead of STZ [35].  Streptozotocin
was dissolved in cold sterile saline, protected from light, and kept on ice
until the time of the injection to prevent degradation.  After surgery, all
the rats received Pentabiotic (0. 1 ml, intramuscular) to prevent infection and were allowed to recover from anesthesia for 2–4 h in a heated
and well-ventilated room.  Food and water were placed inside the cage
for 10–15 days so that the animals could easily access it without physical trauma caused by head surgery. 
2. 5.  Open ﬁeld test
The OFT was performed 21 days after surgery to evaluate spontaneous locomotor activity of the animals.  The open ﬁeld apparatus was
placed in a moderately lit room (20 lx) and consisted of a circular arena
(97 cm diameter, 42 cm height) which was divided into three concentric circles and subdivided into 19 quadrants.  A video camera was
placed on the ceiling right above the arena in order to record animal’s
behavior for posterior analysis.  The animals were individually placed in
the center of the apparatus and allowed to freely explore it for 5 min. 
The following parameters were measured: the total number of crossings
from one quadrant to another, crossings in periphery, crossing in the
center, time spent in periphery, time spent in the center, and rearing
frequency (i. e. , the number of times the animals stood on their hindpaws).  A crossing was considered only when the animal entered another quadrant with its four paws.  The apparatus was cleaned with a
10% ethanol-water solution between each test to eliminate possible
odors left by other rats. 
2. 6.  Elevated plus maze
The EPM test was performed to evaluate anxiety-like behavior
22 days after surgery, according to previous studies [43,44].  The EPM
apparatus was constructed of wood and painted black.  It consisted of
two opposite open arms (50 cm × 10 cm) without sidewalls and two
closed arms (50 cm × 10 cm × 30 cm) with sides and end walls extending from a central area (10 cm × 10 cm).  The maze was elevated
60 cm above the ﬂoor and placed in a moderately lit room (20 lx).  A
video camera was placed on the ceiling right above the arena in order to
record the animals’ behavior for posterior analysis.  The animals were
individually placed in the central area of the EPM, facing an open arm. 
Their behavior was recorded for 5 min and the following parameters
were analyzed: time spent on the open arms, percentage of time spent
on the open arms, time spent on the closed arms, percentage of time
spent on the closed arms, number of open arm entries, number of closed
arm entries, total entries, risk assessment (i. e. , the number of times the
rat left a closed arm with the forepaws and head only and investigated
the surroundings, not necessarily accompanied by body stretching), and
head dipping (i. e. , the animal is in one of the open arms with its head
advanced to the edge of the platform).  The EPM was cleaned between
each test with a 10% ethanol solution to eliminate odors left by other2. 7.  Object location test (OLT) and object recognition test (ORT)
The OLT and ORT were performed between day 27 and 29 following
surgery to evaluate short-term spatial and short-term recognition
memory, respectively.  Both tests took place in a squared arena,
100 cm × 100 cm × 40 cm, made of wood and painted black.  It was
placed in a moderately lit room (20 lx).  A video camera was positioned
over the arena, and the animals’ behavior was recorded for later evaluation. Behavioural Brain Research 335 (2017) 41–54
The ﬁrst procedure consisted of habituation of the animals in the
box.  Each animal was placed in the empty apparatus for 5 min for free
exploration.  Twenty four hours later, a novel habituation session of
5 min was performed.  After a 1 h delay, on the training session, two
identical objects were placed in the apparatus in a symmetrical position
about 10 cm away from the wall.  The animals were allowed to explore
them freely for 5 min and were then returned to their home cages.  In
the OLT (which was performed on day 28), after a 1 h delay, during the
test session, each rat was put back into the box with one of the objects
displaced 15 cm away from the original position (novel position); animals were allowed to freely explore the objects for 3 min.  In the ORT
(which was performed on day 29), a new training session was done with
two other identical objects placed in a symmetrical position about
10 cm away from the wall, and the animals were allowed to explore
them freely for 5 min and were then returned to their home cages.  After
a 1 h interval, the rats were put back into the arena for the test session;
but now with two dissimilar objects, a familiar one (the sample) and a
new one, and the animals were allowed to freely explore the objects for
3 min [45,46]. 
The objects were made of plastic, glass, or ceramic.  In order to avoid
an olfactory bias, before each trial, the objects were cleaned with a 20%
ethanol solution.  All objects and locations were balanced to reduce
potential biases due to preferences for particular locations or objects.  A
rat could not displace the objects and the subjects were always placed
into the box facing the same wall [45].  Exploration was deﬁned as
sniﬃng at a distance of no more than 2 cm or touching the objects with
the nose and/or forepaws.  Sitting on or turning around the objects was
not considered as exploratory behavior [47].  The animals that spent
less than 5 s exploring the objects were excluded from the test. 
The measures for both the OLT and ORT were the time spent by the
rats while exploring each object during the test session.  The time spent
exploring the familiar and the new object (ORT)/displaced object (OLT)
was represented by ‘a’ and ‘b’, respectively.  The following variables
were calculated: e = a + b, and d = (b − a)/e.  The ‘e’ variable is a
measure of the total exploration time of both objects during the test
session.  ‘d’ is considered a discrimination index between the new and
the familiar objects/locations, and also a relative measure of discrimination that corrects for the exploratory activity (e) [45]. 
2. 8.  Spatial version of Y maze
A symmetrical Y maze was constructed of wood and painted black. 
It consisted of three arms (50 cm length, 27 cm height, 12 cm width)
and arranged at a 120° angle relative to each other.  The spatial version
of this test was performed on day 30 after surgery.  It consisted of a
training session and a test session that were performed at a 1 h interval. 
In the training session, one arm was made inaccessible by a removable
door that was placed in front of it.  Each animal was placed in one of the
other arms (i. e. , “start arm”), which was randomized between groups. 
The animal was allowed to explore these two arms for 5 min and was
then returned to its home cage.  After a 1 h interval, the rat was returned
to its corresponding start arm, but the blockade that prevented access to
the third arm (i. e. , “novel arm”) was removed, thus providing access to
all three arms.  The rat was allowed to explore the three arms for 3 min. 
A video camera was positioned over the Y maze to record the animals’
behavior for later evaluation.  An arm entry was considered only when
both hindpaws were placed completely inside an arm.  Short-term spatial memory was assessed as the time spent on the novel arm, which had
to be signiﬁcantly greater than 33. 3% of the total time in the maze
(corrected for the latency to move from the start arm to another arm
and the time spent in the center of the maze).  The Y maze apparatus
was cleaned between sessions with a 10% ethanol solution to prevent
an olfactory bias [46,48].

2. 9.  Immunohistochemistry
After the last behavioral assessment, 30 days after surgery, the animals were deeply anesthetized with an overdose of chloral hydrate and
transcardially perfused with cold 0. 01 M phosphate-buﬀered saline
(PBS; pH 7. 4) followed by a cold ﬁxative solution (4% paraformaldehyde in 0. 1 M PBS, pH 7. 4), using a peristaltic pump (Insight, Ribeirão
Preto, SP, Brazil).  The brains were removed and postﬁxed in the same
ﬁxative solution for 24 h at 4 °C.  Cryoprotection was made by immersion in a solution of 30% sucrose in 0. 1 M PBS (pH 7. 4) at 4 °C until the
block sank.  After, the brains were snap-frozen in dry ice and ethanol
and stored at −80 °C until sectioning in a cryostat (Leica Biosystems,
Nussloch, Germany). 
Frozen tissue was sliced into coronal semi-serial 30 μm thick sections of the dorsal hippocampus and LVs.  For the dorsal hippocampus,
brain slices spaced 240 μm apart were collected in 8 wells, corresponding to coronal coordinates from bregma −2. 56 to −4. 52 mm
[42], totaling 8–10 sections per well.  For the LVs, brain slices spaced
240 μm apart were collected in 8 wells, corresponding to coronal coordinates from bregma +1. 00 to −0. 92 mm [42], totaling 8–10 sections per well.  The sections were stored at −20 °C in a cryoprotectant
solution that contained 30% ethylene glycol and 15% sucrose in a
0. 05 M phosphate buﬀer until processing.  All sections of each well were
used in an immunohistochemistry reaction for a diﬀerent marker. 
Free-ﬂoating immunohistochemistry for DCX, Ki-67, GFAP, and Iba1 was performed with a ﬁrst step of antigen retrieval.  Brieﬂy, the brain
slices were washed with 0. 1 M PBS with 0. 5% Triton X-100, incubated
with 0. 1 M citrate buﬀer (pH 6. 0) for 30 min at 50 °C, washed again,
incubated with 0. 5% H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature and protected from light.  The brain sections were washed, and incubated with a
2% solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0. 1 M PBS with 0. 5%
Triton X-100 for 1 h.  The brain slices were incubated overnight at 4°C
with the following primary antibodies: goat polyclonal anti-DCX
(1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-Ki-67 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP (1:500; Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA),
and goat polyclonal anti-Iba-1 (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). 
The sections were then incubated with the respective biotinylated
secondary antibodies (1:200) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed, and further
incubated in ABC reagent
(Vectastain Elite ABC Kit, Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature.  The
reaction was revealed by incubating the brain slices with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for
8 min in room temperature [46]. 
Ki-67-stained slices of the DG were counterstained with Nissl
staining and coverslipped according to our standard protocol to facilitate visualization and counting of Ki-67-positive cells in the SGZ of the
DG.  The brain slices for detection of the other markers and areas were
mounted on microscope slides, dehydrated in solutions of ascending
ethanol concentrations, cleared in xylene, and cover slipped.  Ki-67positive cells only in the SGZ, and DCX-positive cells in both the SGZ
and GCL of the DG of the dorsal hippocampus were manually counted
using a BX50 optical microscope (Olympus Optical, Center Valley, PA,
USA) at 400× magniﬁcation.  The periventricular areas (LVs, septum,
and corpus callosum), and the DG, CA1 area, and CA3 area of the dorsal
hippocampus were photographed using the same optical microscope at
200× magniﬁcation.  The immunorreactivity of DCX, Ki-67, GFAP, and
Iba-1 was assessed as the optical density using Image J software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).  The data are expressed as the total number of DCX- or Ki-67-positive cells in the DG of
the hippocampus, and GFAP- or Iba-1- immunorreactive (IR) cells relative to the sham group in DG, CA1 area and CA3 area of hippocampus. 
In the SVZ, the data are expressed as the percentage of DCX, Ki-67-,
GFAP-, and Iba-1-IR cells relative to the sham group. 
2. 10.  Statistical analysis
The data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean
(SEM).  The data were tested for a Gaussian distribution using the
Kolmogorov Smirnov test.  Group diﬀerences were analyzed using oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post-hoc test.  Values of
p < 0. 05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

spontaneous locomotion and exploratory behavior.  The EPM was performed 22 days after the STZ infusion to assess anxiety-like behavior. 
Both behaviors could interfere with the animals’ performance in the
cognitive tests.  The analysis of spontaneous locomotor activity in the
OFT did not reveal any changes in the locomotion parameters analyzed
in all of the groups compared to the sham group (Table 1). 
In the EPM, a reduction in the time spent in closed arms and percentage of time spent in closed arms was observed in the STZ and STZ
+ cur 100 groups compared to the sham group (Table 2), which is an
indication of decreased anxiety-like behavior in those STZ-lesioned
animals.  Anxiety-like behavior can reduce the exploration of novelty in
the OLT, ORT and Y maze.  None of the groups exhibited more anxietylike behavior than the sham group in all of the EPM parameters tested
(Table 2).  In addition, elevated glycemia is another factor that could
interfere with cognitive performance [49].  Therefore, blood glucose
levels were measured 30 days after surgery after the last behavioral
test, to ensure that the animals did not become diabetic.  There were no
signiﬁcant alterations in glycemia in all of the groups compared with
the sham group (p > 0. 05; data not shown). 
3. 2.  STZ-ICV caused cognitive impairments that were partially prevented by
curcumin prolonged treatment
Short-term spatial memory was assessed in the OLT and Y maze on
days 28 and 30 after surgery, respectively, with a 1 h interval between
the training and test sessions.  Short-term recognition memory was assessed in the ORT on day 29 after surgery, with a 1 h interval between
the training and test sessions.  STZ-lesioned animals presented deﬁcits inshort-term spatial memory,
reﬂected by
a decrease
discrimination index in the OLT (Fig.  2A), and a decrease in the time
spent on the new arm in the Y maze (Fig.  2C) when compared with the
sham group.  In the OLT, none of the curcumin-treated groups showed
an increased discrimination index compared with the STZ group
(Fig.  2A).  In the Y maze, none of the curcumin-treated groups spent
more time in the new arm than the STZ group; nor was the time spent
on the new arm signiﬁcantly higher than 33% (Fig.  2C).  Therefore, the
treatment of STZ-lesioned animals with curcumin in diﬀerent doses did
not prevent the impairment in short-term spatial memory.  In the ORT,
STZ-lesioned animals presented deﬁcits in short-term recognition
memory, reﬂected by a decrease in the discrimination index compared
with the sham group (Fig.  2B).  The STZ + cur 50 and STZ + cur 100
groups exhibited an increased discrimination index compared with the
STZ group, which suggests a possible beneﬁcial eﬀect of curcumin in
short-term recognition memory in these doses. 
3. 3.  Curcumin eﬀects on adult neurogenesis in STZ-lesioned animals
The STZ-injected animals exhibited decreased cell proliferation,
reﬂected by the reduction in Ki-67-immunoreactivity (IR) in the SVZ of
the LVs (Figs.  3A, 4A ), and a reduction in Ki-67-positive cells in the
SGZ of the DG of the hippocampus (Figs.  3B, 4A).  However, treatment
with curcumin in any dose did not restore Ki-67-IR in the SVZ (Figs.  3A,
4A) and Ki-67-positive cells in the SGZ of the DG (Figs.  3B, 4A) when
compared with the STZ group. 
Similarly, the STZ-injected animals exhibited decreased newborn
neurons in both neurogenic niches, reﬂected by decreased DCX-IR in
the SVZ of the LVs (Figs.  3C, 4B), and decreased DCX-positive cells in
the DG of the hippocampus compared with the sham group (Figs.  3D,T. B.  Bassani Name

DCX-IR in the SVZ (Figs.  3C, 4B) and DCX-positive cells in the DG (Figs. 
3D, 4B) when compared with the STZ group. 
3. 4.  Curcumin eﬀects on glial markers in STZ-lesioned animals
Immunoreactivity for Iba-1 and GFAP was used to evaluate the
eﬀects of prolonged curcumin treatment on glial markers and neuroinﬂammation.  Thirty days after surgery, the STZ group showed a
marked increase in Iba-1-IR in all periventricular areas analyzed (i. e. ,
LVs, septum and corpus callosum) (Figs.  5A–C, 6A ), and also in the CA1
and CA3 areas of the dorsal hippocampus, but not in the DG, when
compared with the sham group (Figs.  5D–F, 6B).  Curcumin treatment in
the doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg exerted an improvement in Iba-1-IR inT. B.  Bassani Name

corpus callosum (Figs.  5C, 6A), but not in the LVs (Figs.  5A, 6A) and
septum (Figs.  5B, 6A), despite an important but non-signiﬁcant reduction in the LVs and septum.  In the hippocampus, no improvement in
Iba-1-IR was observed in the DG, CA1 and CA3 areas (Figs.  5D–F, 6B)
for all of the curcumin doses tested. 
Similarly, the STZ-injected animals showed a marked increase in
GFAP-IR in all periventricular areas analyzed (i. e. , LVs, septum and
corpus callosum) (Figs.  7A–C, 8A ) and also in the DG, CA1 and CA3
areas of the dorsal hippocampus when compared with the sham group
(Figs.  7D–F, 8B).  Curcumin treatment did not improve GFAP-IR in the
periventricular areas (Figs.  7A–C, 8A) and the hippocampus (Figs. 
7D–F, 8B) in all of the doses tested. 
<Conclusion> Discussion. 
The present study sought to evaluate the eﬀects of prolonged curcumin treatment in short-term spatial and recognition memory, neuroinﬂammation and adult neurogenesis in the STZ-ICV model of sAD. 
We also performed non-cognitive behavioral evaluations of the animals
in the OFT and EPM to assess spontaneous locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior, respectively.  Motor impairments and anxiety could
reduce the animals’ performance in the cognitive tests.  No diﬀerences
among the groups were observed in the OFT (Table 1), suggesting that
there were no motor impairments in the STZ-injected and curcumintreated animals.  Additionally, the STZ and STZ + cur 100 groups spent
less time in the closed arms of the EPM and exhibited a reduced percentage of time in the closed arms (Table 2).  Thus, suggesting a decrease in anxiety-like behavior compared with the sham animals.  NoneT. B.  Bassani Name

of the groups showed more anxiety-like behavior compared with the
sham group in all of the EPM parameters tested.  Previous studies
showed increased anxiety-like behavior in STZ-ICV female mice [17]. 
The discrepancies reported could be attributable to the diﬀerent species
used, the animals’ age and gender and the time interval between the
STZ injections and behavioral analysis. 
The STZ-lesioned animals exhibited impairments in short-term
spatial memory in the OLT and Y maze, and impairments in short-term
recognition memory in the ORT (Fig.  2).  Cognitive impairment related
to the hippocampus-dependent functions, such as a decline in spatial
learning and memory, has been extensively reported in animals that
receive STZ-ICV [17,19,46,50–53].  In addition, impairments in object
recognition memory were demonstrated in STZ-ICV rats [54].  These
features are relevant for animal models of AD because spatial and
temporal disorientation [55] and impairments in episodic memory (i. e. ,
memory that integrates the ‘what’, ‘when’ and ‘where’ components of
an episode or event) are the earliest features of the progressive
cognitive decline that is observed in AD patients [56].  Oral prolonged
curcumin treatment (30 days) was not able to prevent the decline in
short-term spatial memory in the OLT and Y maze (Fig.  2A, C) in any of
the three doses tested (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg).  However, in the ORT,
both the STZ + cur 50 and STZ + cur 100 groups exhibited an increased discrimination index compared with the STZ group (Fig.  2B),
suggesting a possible positive eﬀect of curcumin in short-term recognition memory. 
Recognition and spatial memory are encoded in similar but not
totally overlapping brain structures.  Evidence suggests that the parahippocampal regions of the temporal lobe (namely the perirhinal, entorhinal, and inferior temporal cortices) are very important for visual
object recognition memory in rodents and primates [57].  The perirhinal
cortex is the site of several sensory inputs such as visual, olfactory and
somatosensory stimulus involved in object recognition, and it sends
outputs to the hippocampus.  The perirhinal cortex is involved in object
recognition after short retention intervals (short-term memory), whileT. B.  Bassani Name

septum, and corpus callosum (CC) – A–C) and in the DG, CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus (D–F), 30 days after the ICV injection of STZ.  Curcumin treatment did not reduce GFAP-IR
in all of the hippocampus and periventricular areas analyzed.  The data are expressed as mean ± SEM.  n = 6 per group.  *p < 0. 05, **p < 0. 01, ***p < 0. 001, vs.  sham group (oneway ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test). 
the hippocampus is responsible for long-term object recognition.  The
dorsal hippocampus plays an important role, especially when spatial or
contextual information is a relevant factor [58].  Hippocampal lesions
produce deﬁcits in acquisition and retention of spatial memory [59]. 
The diﬀerent structures encoding spatial and recognition memory may
be involved with the discrepancies in curcumin eﬀects in these diﬀerent
memories. 
Several studies have shown positive eﬀects of curcumin in cognitive
processes.  Curcumin has been reported to improve spatial learning and
memory in cognitive tasks such as the Morris water maze and the
passive avoidance in aged rats [33] and mice [60], in the Aβ peptideinfused rat model of AD [34], and in the STZ-ICV model of sAD in mice
[38] and rats [35–37].  Curcumin also improved object recognition
memory in aged mice [60].  However, this is the ﬁrst report of an improvement in short-term object recognition memory for curcumin in the
STZ-ICV model of sAD. T. B.  Bassani Name

of the hippocampus (B).  Scale bar = 200 μm. 
The relationship between the hippocampus-dependent learning and
memory and adult neurogenesis, especially in the DG, has been extensively investigated in recent years.  Several studies reported a positive correlation between these two processes (i. e. , increased hippocampal neurogenesis
facilitates hippocampus-dependent cognitive
functions, such as pattern separation, spatial learning and memory). 
Conversely, decreased hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with
impairments in pattern separation, spatial
learning and memory
[14,61,62].  Recent reports also indicate a role of adult-born neurons in
acquisition and consolidation of object recognition memory [63,64]. 
Our results are consistent with these previous reports.  Cognitive deﬁcits
in the STZ-injected animals, reﬂected by impairments in short-term
spatial and recognition memory, were associated with a reduction of
adult neurogenesis in the SVZ and DG of the hippocampus in the present study (Fig.  3).  Impairments in short- and long-term spatial memory
associated with decreased cell proliferation, survival and diﬀerentiation/maturation of the newborn neurons in STZ-ICV rats was already
demonstrated by our group [46].  Qu Name [20] have reported a reduction in the number of new neurons (double-labeled BrdU- and Tuj1positive cells) in the DG after ICV-STZ administration, which was associated with severe oxidative stress.  Sun Name [21] have reported a
decrease in the generation of immature and mature neurons in the
hippocampus in rats three months after the administration of STZ,
which was correlated with the development of Aβ pathology.  Prolonged
treatment with curcumin was expected to improve the impairments in
adult neurogenesis elicited by STZ-ICV because of previous reports of
curcumin eﬀects in neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo [26,33,39–41,65]. 
Nevertheless, curcumin treatment in all of the three doses tested did not
improve proliferation of NSCs/NPCs and neurogenesis, reﬂected by Ki67- and DCX-positive cells, respectively, both in the SVZ of the LVs andT. B.  Bassani Name

the DG of the hippocampus (Figs.  3 and 4). 
The mild beneﬁcial eﬀects of curcumin on cognition and neurogenesis could be attributed to its limited capacity to widely avoid the
neuroinﬂammatory process in STZ-lesioned animals in the doses and
administration regimen tested in this study.  Acute and chronic neuroinﬂammation can negatively impact many steps of adult neurogenesis
in the mammalian brain such as proliferation, diﬀerentiation and survival of newborn neurons.  Adult neurogenesis has been found to be
altered in several neurodegenerative disorders,
including AD, and
neuroinﬂammation is a common feature of these pathologies [66].  In
the present study, we observed a severe inﬂammatory response in the
periventricular areas and the hippocampus of the STZ-ICV rats, reﬂected by an increase in the immunorreactivity for Iba-1 (marker of
microglia – Figs.  5 and 6) and GFAP (marker of astrocytes – Figs.  7 and
8) 30 days after surgery.  The STZ + cur 25 and STZ + cur 50 groups
exhibited a partial reduction in Iba-1-IR in corpus callosum (Fig.  5C),
but not in the LVs (Fig.  5A), septum (Fig.  5B) and hippocampus
(Fig.  5D–F).  Curcumin treatment in any dose did not decrease GFAP-IR
in the periventricular areas and the hippocampus (Figs.  7 and 8).  The
increase in both glial markers occurred along with a decrease in the
proliferation marker Ki-67 and immature neurons marker DCX in the
SVZ and DG, 30 days after STZ administration (Figs.  3 and 5).  This
suggests that the strong inﬂammatory response that was triggered by
STZ is involved with the inhibition of the proliferation of NSC/NPC and
diﬀerentiation in newborn neurons in both neurogenic niches.  Additionally, the limited eﬀects of curcumin on inhibiting glial cells activation seem to be related to its limited eﬀects on neurogenesis and
cognition.  Clinical trials of curcumin treatment in AD patients also did
not ﬁnd signiﬁcant improvements on cognition and biomarkers in blood
and cerebrospinal ﬂuid [29].  However, these results are in contrast with
other studies which demonstrated anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects of curcumin by suppressing NF-κB activation in vitro [28], reducing GFAPT. B.  Bassani Name
expression in the hippocampus of Aβ-induced AD model in rats [67]
and reducing Iba-1- and GFAP-IR in the striatum of 6-hydroxidopaminelesioned mice [68]. 
The outcome of curcumin treatment may be inﬂuenced by its poor
oral bioavailability, despite of the doses tested being within the range of
doses reported to have positive eﬀects in previous works.  Studies have
shown that curcumin is poorly absorbed from the intestine after oral
administration of diﬀerent doses of 3H-curcumin in rats.  It is estimated
that approximately 75% of an oral dose of curcumin is excreted in the
feces.  Thus, suggesting low absorption of curcumin from the intestine
[69].  The discrepancies between our results and previous reports may
be due to a wide range of curcumin doses tested in these studies
(10–300 mg/kg), administration pathways (oral gavage, food supplementation or intraperitoneal), diﬀerent vehicles, and treatment duration (10 days to 12 weeks).  Also, the STZ dose (3 mg/kg) used in this
study is considered to be high because of the intense oxidative stress
and neuroinﬂammation triggered by STZ, which would be comparable
to a moderate to advanced phase of AD [18].  Treatment with curcumin
in animals lesioned with lower doses of STZ, mimicking an early stage
of AD, would probably result in better therapeutic outcomes. 
In conclusion, the ICV administration of STZ elicited marked cognitive impairments on short-term spatial and recognition memory, reduction in adult neurogenesis and increased neuroinﬂammation, which
were only partially improved by curcumin.  Oral prolonged curcumin
treatment in the doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg preserved short-term object
recognition memory, but not short-term spatial memory.  All of the
curcumin doses tested exerted only slight improvements in neuroinﬂammation, resulting in no restoration in hippocampal and subventricular neurogenesis.  These results suggest a positive eﬀect of
curcumin in object recognition memory which was not related with
hippocampal neurogenesis.  More investigations are needed to assess the
possible beneﬁcial eﬀects of curcumin treatment in AD, especially in
models relating to the early stage of this disease.
