Recent evidence has shown that brain activity measured with the
event-related potentials (ERP) method co-varies with preferences for
consumer goods (Junghöfer Name, 2010; Pozharliev, Verbeke, Van
Strien, & Bagozzi, 2015; Schaefer, Buratto, Goto, & Brotherhood, 2016;
Telpaz, Webb, & Levy, 2015).  This is an important development in an
emerging ﬁeld – consumer neuroscience – that aims to investigate
consumer behaviour (CB) with neuroscience methods.  The results from
two of these studies (Telpaz Name, 2015; Junghofer Name, 2010) suggest
that early brain potentials (neural signals occurring less than 300 ms
after participants ﬁrst see the image of a consumer good) can index
consumer preferences. 
These results can be interpreted from the perspective of the “motivated attention” theoretical
framework (Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert,
1997; Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006), which contends that similar early
ERPs reﬂect automatic attentional processes towards motivationally
relevant stimuli (Olofsson, Nordin, Sequeira, & Polich, 2008; Schupp,
Flaisch Name, 2006; Walker Name, 2011).  However, a striking aspect of
ERP studies of CB is that they do not report consistent links between
consumer preferences and late ERP positivities, which are often

modulated by motivationally relevant stimuli (Olofsson Name, 2008),
and are thought to reﬂect post-perceptive and controlled selective attention processes (Schupp, Stockburger Name, 2006).  In order to investigate this issue, the primary goal of this study was to examine the
ERP correlates of consumer preferences with a particular focus on late
ERP positivities.  In the remainder of this section we brieﬂy review past
work on motivated attention processes and their electrophysiological
correlates.  We then review existing ERP studies of consumer behaviour
and provide an overview of the present study.

Motivated attention is classically separated in two subprocesses: A
quick, “preattentive” mechanism of attentional orientation; and a more1996;

processes by aﬀective-motivational factors can occur through two different routes.  First a “quick” route would involve subcortical structures
predominantly involved in the evaluation of motivational relevance
(e. g.  the amygdala; Pessoa & Adolphs, 2010; Schaefer Name, 2006). 
These structures would detect the presence of motivationally relevant
information in the environment through sensory inputs and would
subsequently modulate activity in sensory cortices through relatively
direct pathways (Vuilleumier & Huang, 2009).  This route is classically
thought to be automatic (Vuilleumier, Armony, Driver, & Dolan, 2001),
although evidence suggests that it can be modulated by top-down
controlled processes (Pessoa, McKenna, Gutierrez, & Ungerleider, 2002;
Pessoa, Padmala, & Morland, 2005). 
The second pathway of motivated attention is one in which neocortical networks (mainly frontal and parietal areas) receive inputs
conveying emotional information, and subsequently modulate sensory
cortices.  This mechanism is thought to be linked to overt and controlled
attentional processes (LeDoux, 1996; Vuilleumier & Huang, 2009).  Beyond the main theoretical distinction between a quick “preattentive”
and a slower overt attentional response, a third process is often proposed in which attentional resources would be allocated to motivationally-relevant stimuli in a temporally sustained manner.  This third
subtype of motivated attention would most likely involve working
memory (WM) processes and facilitate a more elaborative processing of
motivationally-relevant
information (Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006;
Watts, Buratto, Brotherhood, Barnacle, & Schaefer, 2014). 
scalp sites
ERP researchers have identiﬁed three types of brain potentials to
emotional pictures that map onto the three attentional subprocesses
described above.  As some of us explained in previous articles (Walker
Name, 2011; Watts Name, 2014), ERPs to stimuli of higher motivational
relevance (e. g.  emotional stimuli, faces, aﬀective stimuli) can be divided into three subtypes.  First, pre–400 ms ERPs to motivationally
relevant stimuli are thought to reﬂect a rapid and automatic orientation
of attention triggered by evolutionary and/or motivationally relevant
properties of external stimuli (Mavratzakis, Herbert, & Walla, 2016;
Olofsson Name, 2008; Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006).  Second, an ERP
called “Late positive potential” has often been observed after 400 ms
following the onset of a motivationally relevant stimulus.  This ERP is
characterised by a strong positivity that can be observed across the
entire scalp with maxima in posterior
(Codispoti,
Ferrari, & Bradley, 2007; Schupp Name, 2000).  The latencies of this effect vary across studies but they tend to be predominant between 400
and 800 ms (Codispoti, De Cesarei, & Ferrari, 2012).  The LPP is thought
to reﬂect overt, post-perceptive attentional responses to motivationallyrelevant stimuli that are more sustained in time and for which the involvement of controlled processes would be more important than the
pre–400 ms eﬀects (Codispoti Name, 2007; Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006;
Walker Name, 2011).  Third, a more sustained ERP positivity for motivationally relevant pictures has been observed after 800 ms post-stimulus onset.  This eﬀect consists of a sustained waveform that can last a
few seconds after stimulus onset (Diedrich, Naumann, Maier, & Becker,2006;
Hajcak & Olvet, 2008).  The topography of this eﬀect is often widely
distributed across the scalp over both fronto-central and centro-parietal
sites (Foti & Hajcak, 2008; Hajcak & Olvet, 2008).  These ERP eﬀects are
commonly labeled as positive slow waves (PSW) (Schupp, Flaisch Name,
2006) or as “late LPP” (Leutgeb, Schäfer, & Schienle, 2009; Schienle,
K & chel, & Leutgeb, 2011), and they are thought to reﬂect sustained
attentional processes related to the maintenance and potential manipulation of information in working memory (Schupp, Flaisch Name,Hajcak & Nieuwenhuis,
Foti & Hajcak,2.  Event-related brain potential studies of consumer behaviour
The vast majority of studies investigating the ERP correlates of
motivational relevance have used stimuli conveying an intrinsic emotional and evolutionary meaning, such as pictures of faces displayingif
that determines
emotional expressions or pictures of emotional scenes (e. g.  dead bodies,
scenes of violence and threat, etc. ).  It is not yet well established if these
results can be generalized to objects that have acquired their motivational relevance because of their economic value.  We deﬁne the economic value of an object as the computation of subjective beneﬁts andan object will be preferred (see
Levy & Glimcher, 2012; Montague & Berns, 2002).  The choice of acquiring an object is thought to be strongly determined by its economic
value (Padoa-Schioppa & Assad, 2006).  The evaluation of the economic
value of an object is thought to involve the assessment of the value of
several of its attributes, and this process can vary across diﬀerent types
of objects.  However, it is believed that the human brain can represent
this information into a “common scale” of value that allows comparing
between diﬀerent potential choices (Levy & Glimcher, 2012). 
Importantly, it has been suggested that the economic value of objects and
actions can be determined by a previous history of gains and losses that
can be understood from the perspective of reinforcement learning
models (Montague & Berns, 2002; Schaefer Name, 2016), although it is
often suggested that a number of contextual eﬀects can also modulate
these valuation processes (Kalwani, Yim, Rinne, & Sugita, 1990). al. ,2007;Consumer goods are typical examples of objects that have acquired
motivational relevance through their economic value, as the “desire to
own” (Knutson, Rick, Wimmer, Prelec, & Loewenstein, 2007) a consumer good is largely determined by an evaluation of its subjective
beneﬁts and costs (Kalwani Name, 1990; Knutson Name, 2007; Winer,
1986).  However, despite a recent surge of studies using neuroimaging
(Karmarkar, Shiv, & Knutson, 2014; Knutson Name, 2007; Plassmann,
O’Doherty, & Rangel,Bode, & Haynes, 2010) and psychophysiological methods (e. g.  Rasch,
Louviere, & Teichert, 2015; Walla, Brenner, & Koller, 2011) to investigate consumer behaviour, only a very limited number of studies
have approached this question using the ERP method.  Previous studies
that have examined ERPs related to preferences for consumer goods
have focused mainly on early (pre-400) ERPs.  For instance, Telpaz Name
(2015) found a relationship between the N200 component and product
preferences measured by a behavioural choice procedure in which
participants needed to choose between pairs of products.  Telpaz Name
(2015) suggested that this N200 eﬀect could reﬂect an eﬀect of the
Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN), an ERP component that overlaps
with the N200, and which has been linked to the evaluation of prediction errors
(Mushtaq, Wilkie, MonWilliams, & Schaefer, 2016), and more recently, to positive surprise and
buying preferences in a virtual shopping task (Schaefer Name, 2016). 
Furthermore, a study using magnetoencephalography (MEG) found that
early brain potentials (between 110 and 230 ms post-stimulus onset)
reﬂecting motivated attention were related to gender-speciﬁc preferences for consumer goods (Junghöfer Name, 2010). 
in decision-making tasks
Although these studies provide evidence in favour of the notion of
the involvement of early attentional responses in consumer preferences,
evidence regarding later eﬀects is scant and contradictory.  Pozharliev
Name’s (2015) study reported a relationship between the LPP and preferences for luxury goods only when participants were in a social
context, and Bosshard Name (2016), although not using pictures of
consumer goods, found a relationship between the LPP and the extent
to which brand names were liked.  In contrast to these studies, the work
by Telpaz Name (2015) described above did not ﬁnd eﬀects in the LPP or
in any later time window.  In addition, to our knowledge no study has
reported testing the relationship between the PSW and preferences for
consumer goods in a shopping context.  Furthermore, the apparent
contradiction between Telpaz Name (2015) and Pozharliev Name (2015)
regarding late positivities is diﬃcult to resolve as they used markedly
diﬀerent methods: First, Telpaz Name (2015) repeated the presentation
of every individual stimulus 50 times whereas Pozharliev Name (2015)
used single presentations for each item, which may have caused differences between these studies regarding potential habituation eﬀects
of late positivities (Ravden & Polich, 1998); Second, Telpaz Name (2015)

and all participants signed an informed consent before taking part in
the experiment. 
3.  Overview
Therefore, the primary goal of this study was to examine and
characterize the electrophysiological responses to consumer goods that
are preferred compared to less preferred goods using a wide diversity of
non-repeated consumer goods and a procedure that maximized motivational engagement.  In order to ﬁll an important gap in the literature,
we focused on the positive slow waves (PSW) and the LPP, but we also
tested the eﬀects of consumer preference on the amplitude of the N200
brain potentials in order to provide a comparison with previous research.  In order to attain this goal, we asked participants to take part in
a modiﬁed version of a shopping task used in previous studies (Knutson
Name, 2007; Plassmann Name, 2007; Schaefer Name, 2016).  In this task,
participants were shown pictures of familiar consumer goods, which
they could later purchase, and were asked to rate their level of preference towards each item while their scalp EEG was recorded. 
A secondary goal of this study was to verify if the same ERPs that
are modulated by preference ratings can also vary according to subsequent “purchasing” decisions, and whether any potential relationship
between ERPs and subsequent decisions can be accounted for by an
eﬀect of preference.  Therefore, we also categorized ERPs time-locked to
the viewing of consumer goods relative to whether participants decided
to buy them or not.  Finally, we tested if this Buy/No-Buy (BNB) eﬀect
on ERPs was still present when only products from a homogenous level
of subjective preference were considered, which would attenuate any
eﬀect of subjective preference.  If any potential eﬀect of BNB were still
observed in such circumstances, this could tentatively indicate that the
eﬀect of BNB decisions on ERPs can be dissociated from eﬀects of
subjective preferences. 
4.  Methods
4. 1.  Participants
Forty-ﬁve right-handed adults (24 females; mean age = 21. 64,
SD = 2. 77) with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders
participated in this experiment.  From this initial sample, seven participants were excluded because they did not have at least 16 artifact-free
trials in one of the three main conditions (“Low”, “Middle”, or “High”
preference: LP, MP, HP).  This criterion was used to make sure that all
ERP waveforms had an acceptable signal to noise ratio (Luck, 2005). 
The ﬁnal sample had 38 participants (22 females, mean age = 21. 49,
SD = 2. 76).  Participants were recruited from the student population of4. 2.  Stimuli
We used colour digital pictures of 180 products selected from local
shops and online retailers which were familiar to our participants.  The
average familiarity score reported by this study’s participants for the
products was 6. 51, SD = 1. 13, out of a scale ranging from 1 to 9.  It
should be noted that this score was signiﬁcantly higher than the midpoint of the scale (5), t = 8. 25, p < 0. 001 (two-tailed).  We also veriﬁed that the means of the familiarity ratings were higher than 5 separately for the three main conditions of the experiment: LP (M = 5. 77,
SD = 1. 72, t = 2. 75, p = 0. 009), MP (M = 6. 61, SD = 1. 02, t = 9. 77,
p < 0. 001), and HP (M = 7. 75, SD = 0. 68, t = 25. 03, p < 0. 001). 
These results indicate that the products used in this study were overall
familiar to our participants.  The products included a large variety of
items, such as electronics, food, drinks, sports equipment, and others. 
We provide examples of our digital pictures in the supplementary section (Supplementary Fig.  1).  The mean prices of the products, calculated as the mean of the prices of each product in two diﬀerent retailers,
ranged from 2. 35 to 66 Malaysian Ringgits
(RM, M = 24. 59,
SD = 17. 59) (based on the conversion rate at the time of data collection, in US dollars, this ranged from 0. 56 to 15. 84 USD). 
4. 3.  Behavioural paradigm
Participants sat in a comfortable chair at approximately 80 cm from
a 22” monitor on which the stimuli were displayed.  E-Prime 2. 0
(Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) was used to display the
stimuli on the screen.  We recorded participants’ scalp EEG while they
performed a virtual shopping task during which each participant was
shown a sequence of 180 products on the screen.  For each product, the
trial sequence included nine stages (depicted in Fig.  1): First, participants saw a ﬁxation (black cross on white screen) displayed for a
random duration (800–1700 ms).  Second, the image of a product was
shown on the computer screen for 3 s.  In the third, fourth, and ﬁfth
stages, pleasantness, wanting and familiarity were measured using selfreport items adapted from Schaefer Name (2016).  The items were “How
pleasant is the product to you? (1 = Very unpleasant, 9 = Extremely
pleasant)”, “How much do you want the product? (1 = I don’t want this
item at all, 9 = I really want this item)”, and “How familiar are you
with the product? (1 = Not familiar at all, 9 = Extremely familiar)”.  In
the sixth stage, a ﬁxation was again displayed for a random duration
(800–1700 ms).  In the seventh stage, the image of the product was
N.  Goto Name
Biological Psychology 128 (2017) 11–20
shown again with a price superimposed on it.  In the eighth stage,
participants saw a ﬁxation again for 1 s.  Finally (ninth stage), the price
superimposed on the image was shown again, and participants were
prompted to decide whether or not to buy the product at the oﬀered
price from a virtual allocation of RM100 (24 USD), which was reset for
every product (see Fig.  1).  At the end of the experiment, a computer
program randomly selected one of the products that were “bought” by
the participant.  This chosen product and “cash savings”, (the RM100
allocation minus the oﬀered price for the product) were given to participants later.  This approach was used to increase the motivational
engagement of the participants, and to maximize the likelihood that a
“true” economic value would be attributed to the goods (see Knutson
Name, 2007; Schaefer Name, 2016). 
and RM49. 5 (11. 88 USD)
In order to encourage participants to purchase products during the
experiment, oﬀered prices were discounted from the means of the
prices by 25%.  Thus, prices shown to participants ranged between
RM1. 76 (0. 42 USD)
(M = 18. 44,
SD = 13. 19).  Furthermore, we sought to minimize possible biases that
could be caused by strategies based on buying a minimal amount of
products.  To achieve this goal, and following previous research
(Schaefer Name, 2016), participants lost money on their ﬁnal cash
savings if they did not buy a minimum number of products, according
to a schedule previously explained to them.  If the number of bought
products were less than or equal to 18, RM30 (7. 2 USD) would be deducted from the savings.  If this number was between 19 and 24, RM15
(3. 6 USD) would be lost.  If the number was between 25 and 30, participants would lose RM3 (0. 72 USD) from their savings.  If participants
bought more than 30 products, they would not lose any money at the
end.  All of the aspects of the behavioural paradigm were explained to
participants before the experiment, and their understanding was conﬁrmed by a small quiz.  The experiment lasted approximately 2 h. 
4. 4.  Electrophysiological data recording and pre-processing
Each participant’s scalp EEG was recorded using 32 Ag/AgCl electrodes embedded in “Waveguard” purpose-made caps following the
standard 10–20 system of electrode locations and an “ASALAB” ampliﬁer (both manufactured by ANT Neuro, Enschede, Netherlands) at a
sampling rate of 512 Hz (DC–138 Hz bandwidth).  Impedance was kept
below 10 kΩ, and a common average reference was used during recording.  EEG preprocessing followed a standard procedure used in our
previous work (e. g. , Mushtaq Name, 2016; Schaefer, Pottage, & Rickart,
2011; Watts Name, 2014), using the ERP module of BESA (Version 6. 0,
BESA GmbH, Gräfelﬁng, Germany).  Data were converted oﬀ-line to an
average mastoids reference, ﬁltered (0. 01–40 Hz), segmented into
epochs between 200 ms before and 3000 ms after the onset of the
product images on the screen (second stage of the procedure described
above) and baseline corrected.  Eye movements were corrected using a
multipleBerg, & Scherg, 2002) as implemented in BESA (“Surrogate method”). 
In addition, for each channel, epochs with a diﬀerence between the
maximum and minimum voltage amplitude > 120 μV and a maximum
diﬀerence between two adjacent voltage points > 75 μV were rejected
(after eye movement artifact correction). 
analysis method
(Berg & Scherg,1994;
Three ERP waveforms were created based on each individual participant’s ratings on the “wanting” scale.  For each participant, products
rated as 1, 2, or 3 on the wanting scale were categorized as Low
Preference (LP), those rated as 4, 5, or 6 as Middle Preference (MP), and
those rated as 7, 8, 9 as High Preference (HP).  All 38 participants had
equal to or more than 16 artifact-free trials in all these three conditions
and thus were included for the analyses.  The mean numbers of artifactfree trials for LP, MP, and HP were 63, 52. 68, and 38. 87, respectively. 
In order to examine whether ERP waveforms can be diﬀerentiated by
participants’ subsequent decisions to buy or not to buy the products, we
also created ERP waveforms time-locked to the viewing of the products
(second stage) and separated according to whether they were followed
by a “buy” or “no-buy” decision.  In addition, we also examined if this
Buy vs.  No-Buy (BNB) eﬀect could be observed when levels of subjective preference were kept homogenous.  To achieve this aim, we
performed subsample analysis on a group of participants who had enough artifact-free trials to test the BNB eﬀect when only MP trials were
considered (N = 26).  The same eﬀect could not be reliably tested for LP
or HP because in these conditions, the numbers of “Buy” or “No-Buy”
responses (respectively) were too low, given that participants tended to
buy preferred items and decline to buy items with low levels of preference, as expected.  To maximize the subsample group size, we used a
liberal criterion of a minimum of 12 artifact-free trials for each speciﬁc
condition, in accordance with previous literature investigating late
positive ERP activities (Kim, Vallesi, Picton, & Tulving, 2009; Otten,Koenig,
Brandeis, & Perrig, 2011; Watts Name, 2014; Yick, Buratto, & Schaefer,Ditewig, & Rugg,
Padovani,2006;
4. 5.  ERP quantiﬁcation
Our analysis of ERP data had two primary goals.  First, we wanted to
test if previous results about the relationship between the N200 component and consumer preferences could be replicated.  Second, we
wanted to examine if sustained post-400 positivities (LPP and PSW)
were also related to subjective preferences and choice. 
4. 5. 1.  Replication attempt of N200 results2013;
Bland, & Schaefer,
The N200 was quantiﬁed using peak to peak scores, as this is often a
recommended method to quantify overlapping components such as the
P200/N200 complex (Hajcak, Moser, Holroyd, & Simons, 2006; Luck,
2005; Mushtaq,
Osinsky,
Mussel, & Hewig, 2012).  Given that the P200 is often linked to the N200
in the same complex, we also analyzed the P200 with peak to peak
scores.  On the basis of a visual inspection of our waveforms and previous literature (e. g. , Telpaz Name, 2015; Walker Name, 2011), we extracted peak amplitudes of each participant from three time windows:
70–150 ms (N100), 130–250 ms (P200), and 200–400 ms (N200). 
Then, we subtracted N100 from P200 absolute peak amplitudes in order
to quantify a peak to peak P200 amplitude.  Similarly, we subtracted
P200 from N200 absolute peak amplitudes in order to quantify peak to
peak N200 amplitudes.  In order to perform statistical analyses, we extracted these peak to peak scores from a sample of nine electrodes allowing coverage of Frontal, Central and Parietal sites, in left, midline
and right hemispheres: F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz, and P4.  For both
P200 and N200 we then conducted a 3 (Item Category: LP vs.  MP vs. 
HP) x 3 (Anterior-Posterior [AP]: Frontal vs.  Central vs.  Parietal) x 3
(Laterality [LAT]: Left, Midline vs.  Right) repeated-measure analysis of
variance (ANOVA).  Furthermore, we also conducted a 2 (Buy vs.  NoBuy [BNB]) x 3 (AP) x 3 (LAT) repeated-measure ANOVA with the main
sample in order to examine the eﬀects of subsequent buying decisions
on our ERP waveforms.  Next, we performed a 2 (MP/Buy vs.  MP/NoBuy) x 3 (AP) x 3 (LAT) ANOVA with a subsample, as explained in the
“Electrophysiological data recording and pre-processing” section. 
Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were applied when necessary, and results were considered signiﬁcant at p < 0. 05.  Analyses of the P200
data did not reveal any signiﬁcant eﬀects and therefore we do not report these further. 
4. 5. 2.  Late positivities
The LPP is usually quantiﬁed between 400 and 800 ms, whereas the
PSW is usually observed after 800 ms, and can extend to 3 s or beyond
(Diedrich Name, 1997; Foti & Hajcak, 2008; Hajcak & Olvet, 2008). 
Therefore, we separated the late positive ERPs into 4 consecutive 400ms windows: 400–800, 800–1200, 1200–1600, 1600–2000, and in accordance with previous research (Foti & Hajcak, 2008; Hajcak & Olvet,
2008), we also quantiﬁed a longer time window from 2000 ms to
3000 ms.  For each time window, we extracted mean amplitudes thatN.  Goto Name
Biological Psychology 128 (2017) 11–20
were used in subsequent data analyses and we conducted ANOVAs
identical to the ones employed for the N200 data, using the same array
of electrodes.  These ANOVAs were conducted separately by each time
window, and Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were applied when necessary.  Given that testing each eﬀect repeatedly across ﬁve diﬀerent
time windows could inﬂate the false positive rate, we corrected the pvalue of each eﬀect with the Bonferroni method. 
5.  Results
5. 1.  Behavioural data
5. 1. 1.  Manipulation checks
We ﬁrst analyzed how items in LP, MP, and HP categories were
perceived by the main sample (n = 38) on the scales of wanting,
pleasantness, and familiarity with repeated-measure ANOVAs.  Since
these categories were derived from the wanting scores, not surprisingly,
we found that HP items were wanted more (M = 7. 71, SD = 0. 32) than
MP items (M = 4. 98, SD = 0. 21, p < 0. 001) and LP items (M = 2. 07,
SD = 0. 47, p < 0. 001).  MP items were also wanted more than LP
items (p < 0. 001), and these comparisons were accompanied by a very
signiﬁcant main eﬀect of item category on wanting scores, F(1. 41,
2 =0. 98.  As expected, HP items were

also perceived to be more pleasant (M = 7. 59, SD = 0. 67) than MP
(M = 6. 11, SD = 0. 85,
(M = 4. 70,
SD = 1. 22, p < 0. 001), and MP items were perceived to be more
pleasant than LP (p < 0. 001), and these comparisons were supported
by a main eﬀect of category on pleasantness scores, F(1. 28, 47. 38)

Next, we wanted to verify if the three categories of subjective preference could truly be accounted by diﬀerences in “Wanting” rather
than pleasantness, familiarity, or oﬀered price.  To address this question,
we adopted a multilevel approach to our data.  In this analysis, a categorical variable reﬂecting the 3 preference categories (“Item Category”:
LP, MP and HP) was the dependent variable, and scores of wanting,
familiarity, pleasantness, and oﬀered prices were the predictors.  We
hypothesized that if the relationship between wanting scores and item
categories disappeared or was signiﬁcantly reduced after the inclusion
of the other predictors, then this result could suggest that the item
categories were accounted for by variables other than “wanting”.  Using
a multilevel approach enabled us to examine these eﬀects at the level of
individual trials while taking into account potential between-subjects
variability. 
Speciﬁcally, we used the “linear mixed models” option of SPSS to
analyze trial-speciﬁc data, while taking into account diﬀerences between participants.  We included item category (LP = 1, MP = 2,
HP = 3) as a dependent variable and ﬁrst tested the eﬀects of wanting
scores on this variable, using an unstructured covariance type.  Not
surprisingly, the results indicated that wanting scores signiﬁcantly
predicted the preference category (b = 0. 313, p < 0. 001).  Next, we
added pleasantness, familiarity scores and oﬀered price to the model. 
The eﬀect of wanting score slightly increased (b = 0. 320, p < 0. 001),
and it turned out that pleasantness also predicted item category, although the eﬀect size was much smaller (b = −0. 010, p = 0. 018) than
the eﬀect of wanting.  Familiarity (b = −0. 003, p = 0. 100) and oﬀered
price (b = −0. 000, p = 0. 827) did not predict preference category. 
Consistent with our expectations, these results suggest very strongly
that item categories of LP, MP and HP are mainly determined by the
“wanting” scores, and that they cannot be fully accounted by pleasantness, familiarity, or oﬀered price.  Pleasantness seems to have a
statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect on item category, although with a much
smaller eﬀect size than wanting. 
Finally, we examined whether there were any thematic biases in the
categorization of products into HP, MP and LP.  For instance, if electronic products were more frequently categorized into HP than household items (whereas the same imbalance would not be observed in LP
and MP), then any comparisons between HP and MP or LP could be
compromised by a confound between preference and perceptual differences between groups of products (e. g.  electronics products vs.  other
types of products).  The 180 products used in our study can be categorized into 9 product categories: drink, electronic goods, food, health
care, home goods, housekeeping goods, kitchen appliance, sports
equipment, and stationary.  Chi-square tests revealed that none of these
product categories were over- or underrepresented in LP (X2 (8)
= 7. 70, p = 0. 46), MP (X2 (8) = 1. 49, p = 0. 99), or HP (X2 (8)
= 4. 93, p = 0. 76).  These analyses indicate that thematic contents of
product images were equally distributed within each of the preference
categories (HP, MP, LP). 
5. 1. 2.  Buying rate
Next, we examined whether participants’ decisions to buy products
diﬀered across the item categories.  For this analysis, the main dependent variable was a ratio between the number of “Buy” decisions in an
item category divided by the total number of items in that particular
category.  As expected, a repeated-measure ANOVA revealed that participants made buy decisions more often for HP items (M = 0. 76,
SD = 0. 16) than for MP items (M = 0. 32, SD = 0. 18, p < 0. 001) and
LP items (M = 0. 05, SD = 0. 06, p < 0. 001).  The MP-LP contrast was
also signiﬁcant (p < 0. 001), and these contrasts were supported by a
signiﬁcant main

5. 2.  Brain potentials
Fig.  2 shows a very clear diﬀerentiation between highly preferred
items compared to less preferred items.  Waveforms related to HP items
yielded a stronger positivity than both MP and LP starting at approximately 350 ms and this eﬀect appears to be sustained until the end of
the epoch.  However, the diﬀerence between HP and MP seems to
progressively diminish after 1200 ms, whereas the HP-LP diﬀerence
remains robust across most of the epoch.  Scalp maps in Fig.  2 also show
that, at least for the HP-LP contrasts, the topography of the eﬀects
encompasses both fronto-central and centro-parietal sites.  Fig.  3 also
shows that the BNB eﬀects are very similar to the eﬀects of subjective
preference.  In addition, Fig.  4 shows a clear eﬀect of subjective preference on the N200 component, indicating that more preferred items
are associated to more positive amplitudes than items with lower levels
of preference.  Statistical analyses described below generally support
these observations.

topography is similar to previous reports of slow waves relative to
motivationally-relevant stimuli (Foti & Hajcak, 2008; Hajcak & Olvet,
2008).  We therefore proceeded to break down these main eﬀects in
three planned comparisons: HP-LP, HP-MP and MP-LP for every time
window.  Given that this approach resulted in 15 pairwise comparisons
in late positivities, we used Bonferroni corrections to minimize false
positives.  We found that all the HP-LP contrasts were signiﬁcant at
p < 0. 05 (Bonferroni-corrected), whereas the HP-MP contrasts were
signiﬁcant for 400–800 and 800–1200.  The 2000–3000 time window
also yielded a statistically signiﬁcant HP-MP comparison, although its
eﬀect size was much smaller than the corresponding HP-LP comparison
(p = 0. 049 vs.  p = 0. 00024, respectively, Bonferroni-corrected).  MPLP did not reach corrected signiﬁcance thresholds.

<Conclusion> Discussion. 
The main goal of this study was to examine if ERPs of motivated
attention, the N200, the LPP and PSW, were modulated by subjective
preferences and buying choices in a virtual shopping task.  This study is
to our knowledge the ﬁrst to demonstrate that positive slow waves
(PSW) extending up to three seconds after the onset of pictures of
consumer goods could diﬀerentiate between preferred and non-preferred goods.  In addition to this ﬁnding, we also obtained results consistent with previous research: We found that the N200 was modulated
by levels of preference, in accordance with a previous study (Telpaz
Name, 2015); and consistent with Pozharliev Name (2015), we also found
that LPP amplitudes were modulated by item preference.  Furthermore,
we also found that both LPP and PSW amplitudes could diﬀerentiate
between products that were subsequently “bought” or not by participants.  However, subsample analyses revealed that this eﬀect was not
signiﬁcant when only goods with homogenous levels of preferences
were considered. 
Our results are the ﬁrst to show that a large and easily detected ERP
positivity starting around 300 ms post-stimulus onset and lasting up to
3000 ms co-varies with preferences for consumer goods, expressed in
both self-reports and observable choice behaviour.  This result could
have important implications in the ﬁeld of consumer neuroscience (or
the ﬁeld of “neuromarketing”) as it indicates that a well-known ERP
phenomenon can also be a reliable correlate of consumer preferences,
and thus become a useful tool for consumer behaviour (CB) researchers. N.  Goto Name

1600–2000 ms is −0. 2 and 2. 5, and for 2000–3000 ms is −0. 2 and 2. 9,
respectively. 
In addition, the fact that both early and late ERPs were modulated by
preferences also indicates that ERPs can provide a variety of indices of
consumer preference.  However, if ERPs are to become useful indices of
CB, it is necessary to understand the functional meaning of speciﬁc
ERPs associated to consumer preferences.  Therefore, to provide a better
understanding of the nature of our eﬀects, we discuss below in more
detail the potential functional meaning of our ﬁndings. 
6. 1.  Motivational relevance and ERP correlates of consumer preferences
First, the PSW observed after 800 ms in the current study had a
larger amplitude for highly preferred items up until 3 s post-stimulus
onset.  The topography of this eﬀect was distributed over fronto-central
and centro-parietal sites.  These temporal and topographical properties
are similar to slow wave eﬀects observed in studies using emotional
scenes or evolutionary-relevant stimuli (Foti & Hajcak, 2008; Hajcak
Name, 2006; Hajcak & Olvet, 2008), Post-800 slow waves time-locked to
motivationally relevant stimuli are usually interpreted as the manifestation of brain activity related to WM processes (Schupp, Flaisch Name,
2006; Watts Name, 2014).  This notion implies that motivationally-relevant information is preferentially processed in WM in order to facilitate its elaboration.  Further evidence comes from the wider literature
on ERPs linked to WM processes, in which it has often been demonstrated that variations in the cognitive load of WM tasks modulate late(Garcı́a-Larrea & Cézanne-Bert,1998; McEvoy,
Smith, & Gevins, 1998; Rämä Name, 2000; Ruchkin, Johnson,
Mahaﬀey, & Sutton, 1988; Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006; Watts Name,
2014).  From this previous body of research, we speculate that our PSW
results reﬂect processes of active maintenance and elaboration of information in WM required to facilitate the evaluation of consumer
goods and the subsequent decision on whether to buy them or not. 
Future research will be needed to examine whether this eﬀect varies
according to diﬀerences in decisional consequences of perceiving the
goods (e. g.  with or without a shopping context), and diﬀerences in WMThe eﬀects of preference on the N200 replicated Telpaz Name
(2015), and seem to conﬁrm a growing trend indicating that ERPs occurring in the N200 vicinity reﬂect processes linked to consumer behaviour (Schaefer Name, 2016; Telpaz Name, 2015).  N200 eﬀects are also
commonly observed in research using emotional scenes or evolutionary-related stimuli (Olofsson Name, 2008; Walker Name, 2011).  It is
commonly thought that such eﬀects reﬂect an early stimulus-driven
attentional response (Olofsson Name, 2008; Walker Name, 2011).  Telpaz
Name (2015) has suggested that the N200 related to consumer goods
could reﬂect a FRN, a brain potential obtained when participants process decision outcomes that deviate from their expectation (Mushtaq
Name, 2016; Schaefer Name, 2016).  However, in this experiment, the
N200 is not time-locked to the outcome of a decision, and predictionsN.  Goto Name

stage process of evaluating motivationally-relevant consumer goods
that share several similarities with processes of motivated attention
usually associated to classical emotional stimuli: First, early attentional
processes would allow a very quick orientation of attentional resources
on preferred goods.  This process is likely to rely on the detection of
stimulus properties that have acquired motivational relevance through
prior learning.  Next, a more overt attentional response would facilitate
the conscious identiﬁcation of the stimulus, through processes that
probably rely on the integration of multiple sources of information
including perceptual and semantic information.  Finally, processing resources are selectively allocated to the stimulus in a temporally extended manner in order to facilitate a more elaborative form of processing which is likely to be linked to the evaluative and decisional
constraints of viewing consumer goods.  This tentative framework has
very strong overlaps with sequential models of motivated attention in
the context of emotion research (Schupp, Flaisch Name, 2006).  Although
early and late ERPs of motivated attention are widely considered as
serving distinct functions, it would be inaccurate to consider them as a
fully independent.  In most cases these diﬀerent processing stages are
likely to be part of an overarching single process (Schupp, Flaisch Name,
2006; Watts Name, 2014).  Speciﬁcally, an automatic orientation towards motivationally relevant stimuli, and its subsequent overt identiﬁcation can be reasonably seen as causal antecedents of their maintenance in WM for further processing and elaboration (Watts Name,
2014).  However, an important caveat to our interpretation is that it
relies in part on the similarity of the morphology of our ERP data with
results obtained in other studies using intrinsically emotional stimuli. 
Even though an important body of research on the neural correlates of
motivated attention strongly supports our explanation, further ERP
experiments will be needed in which diﬀerent stages of processing of
consumer goods are systematically manipulated (e. g.  WM load, decisional demands, etc. ) to consolidate this knowledge. 
6. 2.  Potential limitations
First, the construct of consumer preference used in our study is
constrained by our operationalization of preferences in terms of
“wanting” self-reports and buying choices.  Wanting self-reports have
been used previously to operationalize preference in consumer neuroscience studies (Knutson Name, 2007; Schaefer Name, 2016) and were
chosen because of their conceptual overlap with our deﬁnition of economic value, that is, the potential beneﬁts brought by obtaining an
object.  Second, observable buying choice is an objective measure of
preference, but also the end goal of most instances of consumer behaviour, and as such it has often been used to investigate neural correlates
of consumer preference (e. g. , Knutson Name, 2007; Plassmann Name,
2007; Schaefer Name, 2016).  However, we do acknowledge that other
methods to estimate preference exist (willingness to pay, choice modeling, etc. ), and future research will be needed to explore relationships
between ERPs and these other methods. 
Second, it could be argued that our approach of providing a schedule of incentives to buy products creates a somewhat unrealistic environment.  As explained in the methods section, this feature of our
procedure was introduced to prevent strategies based on “buying” a
single product or only a restricted set of products.  We acknowledge that
this feature creates a situation where there is no absolute freedom of
choice, but rather a relative freedom of buying choice in which a buyer
receives incentives to buy a certain amount of products from a set list. 
However, many real-life shopping situations conform to a relative
freedom situation, as often shoppers’ behaviours are driven by the need
to purchase a set number of products amongst an available choice (e. g. 
going to the closest supermarket to buy a set list of many household
items because they are running out). 
Third, it could be argued that the fact that participants can truly
purchase only one randomly picked product creates an unrealistic situation.  This procedure has been previously used in other simulated
Fig.  4.  N200 as a function of subjective preferences. 
A.  ERP waveforms from Fz, time-locked to the onset of pictures displaying consumer
goods (second stage) separated by levels of subjective preference.  Amplitude in microvolts (μV) is on the y axis and time in milliseconds is on the x axis.  The arrow indicates the
negative peak of N200. 
B.  Scalp maps plotting contrasts of N200 peak to peak amplitudes between diﬀerent levels
of subjective preference.  The colour bar represents minimum (−1. 7) and maximum (0. 2)are not explicitly elicited before the onset of the stimuli.  These are typical conditions under which the FRN is commonly observed (Hajcak
Name, 2006), and thus their absence does not support the hypothesis
that the N200 that we observed is an FRN.  Alternatively, it is not excluded that an attention-related N200 overlaps with the FRN (Holroyd,
Pakzad-Vaezi, & Krigolson, 2008).  Future research will be needed to
disentangle these two explanations. 
We also observed an eﬀect of preference on a positivity in the
400–800 time window corresponding to the latencies of the LPP, with a
topographical distribution that includes centro-parietal and frontocentral sites, which might reﬂect the multimodal nature of the task that
probably includes both perceptual and semantic processing (These
studies provide similar examples of LPPs with a fronto-central topography: Cunningham, Espinet, DeYoung, & Zelazo, 2005; Gable and
Harmon-Jones, 2010).  This result is consistent with Pozharliev Name
(2015) although we found this eﬀect when participants were alone in
the room, whereas Pozharliev Name reported an LPP associated to
luxury vs.  non-luxury items only when participants were in a social
context.  The procedures used in the two studies are too diﬀerent to
draw deﬁnitive conclusions about this potential contradiction, but it
could be speculated that the possibility of buying products in the current study may have enhanced the motivational engagement towards
preferred products, which could potentially explain this diﬀerence.  This
result is also consistent with a study that found a greater LPP for written
words referring to brand names that were liked (Bosshard Name, 2016)
and a study that found a greater positivity between the 400–1000 latencies while participants were shown cheap vs.  expensive prices
during a virtual shopping task (Schaefer Name, 2016).  Overall, these
results indicate that late ERP positivities may index neural processes
related to consumer behaviours. 
Overall, these results tentatively suggest the existence of a multi18

shopping tasks (Knutson Name, 2007; Plassmann Name, 2007; Schaefer
Name, 2016) to increase the motivational value of the stimuli compared
to tasks in which purchasing is completely ﬁctitious.  This approach is
particularly useful in neuroimaging experiments in which multiple
trials (often hundreds) are needed to improve the signal to noise ratio
(SNR) of brain activity data, as providing funding to the purchase of
hundreds of products in a psychological experiment would be unrealistic in most cases.  Future developments in this ﬁeld of research
could potentially address this issue, such as EEG measurements during
real shopping environments with portable EEG systems, although this
approach poses additional challenges, such as how to address movement artifacts, accurate synchronization between EEG recordings and
the onset of visual stimulation, etc. 
Fourth, it could be argued that the ERP eﬀects observed in our study
could reﬂect emotional feelings towards products, rather than processes
of motivated attention.  This would be a reasonable interpretation, as it
is well understood that preferred products can elicit positive aﬀect (e. g. ,
Walla Name, 2011).  However, there are two problems with this explanation.  First, previous research on ERP late positivities does not
plead in favour of this alternative account.  Although late ERP positivities can easily diﬀerentiate between emotional and non-emotional
stimuli, they are typically unable to reliably diﬀerentiate between negative and positive pictorial stimuli (e. g.
