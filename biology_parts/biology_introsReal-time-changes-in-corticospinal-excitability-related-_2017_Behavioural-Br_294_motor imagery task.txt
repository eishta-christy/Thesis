Motor imagery is deﬁned as the mental execution of an action
without any physical movement or muscle activation [1].  Brain activity
patterns during motor imagery are similar to those during the corresponding physical execution; the primary motor cortex (M1), premotor
cortex, supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and basal ganglia are
activated during motor imagery [2–7].  In addition, many studies have
reported signiﬁcant improvement of motor skills in patients with stroke
as well as in healthy persons after motor imagery training [8–10].  Because force control is always needed to perform a motor activity, motor
imagery training must somehow act on the neural substrates of force
control.  Thus, understanding the detailed eﬀects of motor imagery on
the neural substrates of force control is important for developing a

better rehabilitative strategy involving motor imagery. 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method
used to assess human corticospinal excitability.  The increase in cortical
excitability is evidenced by an increase in motor evoked potential
(MEP) amplitude, and a reduction in the motor threshold of the stimulation [11,12].  Studies using TMS, which has good temporal resolution, have revealed increased corticospinal excitability during
imagination of target muscle contraction without actual contraction
[13–16].  Furthermore, Mizuguchi Name [17] reported that changes in
corticospinal excitability during such motor imagery were related to the
imagined force level.  Stinear and Byblow [18] noted that motor imagery of phasic thumb abduction temporally modulated excitability in
M1, speciﬁc to the representation of the intrinsic hand muscle. 
These previous studies have suggested that corticospinal excitability
during motor imagery is modulated in a force level- and time-dependent manner.  However, in many of these studies, the timing of the
corticospinal excitability that was investigated using TMS was more
closely related to the period during which tonic muscle contraction was
imagined.  In daily life, force control is ﬁnely tuned.  Force needs to be
increased or decreased with a high degree of control in order to accomplish a ﬁne-motor task.  To our knowledge, no study has yet attempted to examine how motor imagery changes corticospinal excitability during the increasing and decreasing phases of force control.  We
hypothesized that corticospinal excitability at such times would gradually increase or decrease, respectively, with the modulation of force. 
Such a ﬁnding would provide new insights into the mechanism underlying the real-time modulation of cerebral cortical activity according
to the state of motor imagery.  The aim of this study was therefore to
examine the real-time changes in corticospinal excitability that occur
during motor imagery in a task requiring isometric force control.

2. 1.  Participants
Ten healthy volunteers (three men and seven women, all righthanded, age range: 20–30 years, mean age: 22. 7 ± 3. 4 years) participated in the present study.  None of the participants had any history of
impairments in terms of neuromuscular or physical function that may
have aﬀected task performance.  This study was performed in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Kanagawa University of
Human Services (Approval Number: HODAI 7–12).  All participants
provided written informed consent prior to their participation in the2. 2.  Electromyography
Electromyography (EMG) of the right extensor carpi radialis (ECR)
and right ﬂexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle was recorded using pairs of
surface Ag/AgCl electrodes placed over these muscles in a belly − tendon montage.  The signal was ampliﬁed and ﬁltered (band pass
5–3000 Hz) using a bioelectric ampliﬁer (Neuropack MEB-2200; Nihon
Kohden Corp. , Tokyo, Japan), digitized at 4000 Hz, and stored for
oﬄine analysis on a laboratory computer (Power Lab system; AD
Instruments Pty Ltd. , New South Wales, Australia). 
2. 3.  Experimental paradigm
The protocol adopted herein has been described in a previous study
[19].  Brieﬂy, the participants sat comfortably on a chair with their right
forearms pronated at 45° and positioned horizontally over a table.  Before initiating the experiment, we measured the force produced in wrist
dorsiﬂexion when each subject performed maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of the ECR against a plate that had a strain gauge
(Kyowa Electronic Instruments Co. , Tokyo, Japan) mounted to theFig.  1.  Experimental design of a force tracking task. 
Participants were instructed to adjust the isometric force of wrist joint dorsiﬂexion to
keep a dot on a target tracking line on a monitor, while the dot moved from the left to
right at a constant speed.  During the performance test and the imagery test, no visual
feedback was provided during tracking of the sine wave (fore generation phase).  MVC;

vertical portion of the plate.  The analog signal was ampliﬁed (SA-250
STRAIN AMPLIFIER; TEAC, Tokyo, Japan), ﬁltered, and digitized (NI
USB-6229 BNC; National Instruments Corp. , Austin, TX). 
For the motor task, the participant was instructed to adjust the
isometric force during right wrist dorsiﬂexion while watching a PC
monitor that displayed a moving dot and a tracking line.  The dot automatically moved horizontally from left to right at a constant speed
(6 cm/s), but moved vertically according to the amount of dorsiﬂexion
force exerted, such that the height of the dot was determined by the
magnitude of the force generated.  A force-tracking line was presented
on the monitor as a sine wave with horizontal lines at both ends (see
Fig.  1).  The horizontal (ﬂat) line indicated zero force.  At the beginning
of the task, the participants relaxed while the dot was moving from left
to right on the horizontal line.  Then, participants exerted (Increasing
phase) and reduced (Decreasing phase) contractile force such that the
dot was continuously maintained on the line of the sine wave; they then
relaxed again (i. e. , zero force) after the dot had passed over the sine
wave.  The peak of the wave, representing the target peak force during
the task, was set at 30% of the wrist dorsiﬂexion MVC. 
The experimental protocol is shown in Fig.  2.  The experiment
consisted of three sessions: the training session, which was used to
construct the mental task image by motor learning and two test sessions, including the performance test and imagery test.  In the training
session, the participants repeatedly performed the motor task described
above with actual muscle contraction in order to construct the motor
imagery.  Training consisted of four blocks, and each block was composed of 10 trials. 
In the performance test, the participants performed the actual motor
task without visual feedback; the target waveform and the dot disappeared at the time the contraction started.  To describe the learning
curve needed to guarantee imagery construction, a performance test
consisting of 10 trials each was carried out at three time points: before
training (pre-training), and after the second and fourth training blocks
(post-training). 
For the imagery test, the participants performed the task without
physical muscle contraction, and with no visual feedback, as per the
performance test.  Participants were instructed to imagine using force
control similar to that used during training.  During imagery, it was
conﬁrmed that there was no muscle contraction by monitoring the
EMG.  The imagery tests, consisting of 50 trials each, were carried out
before training and after the fourth training block (post-training).  A
custom-written computer program (LabVIEW software, ver. 7. 1;
National Instruments Corp. , Austin, TX) was used to design the experimental paradigm, including the TMS protocol described below.

2. 4.  Transcranial magnetic stimulation
TMS was delivered using a Magstim 200 stimulator (Magstim Co. ,
Dyfed, UK) attached to a ﬁgure-of-eight-shaped coil with an internal
wing diameter of 9 cm.  The coil was placed with the handle pointing
backwards, laterally at 45° from the midline, and approximately perpendicular to the central sulcus, to stimulate anteriorly and medially
direct current in the brain.  The coil was optimally positioned to produce
MEPs in the contralateral ECR and FCR.  Surface markings drawn on a
cap that was placed on the scalp served as a reference for coil positioning.  The resting motor threshold (RMT) was deﬁned as the lowest
stimulus intensity needed to produce MEPs greater than 50 μV in the
ECR in at least ﬁve of 10 successive trials during the resting condition. 
The test stimulus was applied at 120% of the RMT. 
Before each imagery test, TMS was applied 10 times at rest, and
MEPs were measured from the ECR and FCR as a control.  Subsequently,
TMS was applied at ﬁve time points during the imagery test (see Fig.  1),
as follows.  I: At 500 ms before the start of the imaged force production,
II: at the midpoint of the Increasing phase, III: at the peak muscle force,
IV: at the midpoint of the Decreasing phase, V: at 500 ms after the end
of the imaged force production.  The time point when TMS was applied
was randomly determined in each test during the 50 imagery tests (i. e. ,
10 times for each test). 
2. 5.  Data analysis and statistics
The process of construction of the task image by motor learning was
evaluated with the error area between the target-tracking sine wave
and the position of the dot during the performance test.  The error area
was presented as an RMS value; and the mean RMS value of 10 trials in
each test was calculated.  The change in mean values across the tests,
before training (pre), and after the second and fourth training blocks,
was analyzed using a one-factor repeated-measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA), with the main factor of training. 
We calculated the oﬄine peak-to-peak amplitudes of all MEPs of the
right ECR and FCR using Lab Chart 7 software (AD Instruments Pty. 
Ltd. , New South Wales, Australia).  Motor cortex excitability for each
muscle (ECR: agonist muscle, FCR: antagonist muscle) during the
imagery test was expressed as the ratio of experimental to resting
condition MEPs.  The eﬀects of training (pre- vs.  post-training) and the
time points (I–V) on the MEP ratio were compared using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. 
To assess EMG activity of the ECR when the TMS pulse was delivered, we calculated the root mean square (RMS) values of the background EMG (B. EMG) activity for a 100-ms period before administering
TMS pulses.  To determine whether B. EMG levels of each muscle affected the MEPs at each time point during imagery, a two-factor repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze the eﬀects of training
(pre- vs.  post-training) and imagery condition (rest and time points
I–V).  A paired t-test with Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons was used for post-hoc analysis if a given ANOVA showed a signiﬁcant interaction and main eﬀect. 
To examine the eﬀect of intervention on the resting condition, the
change in MEP amplitude of the resting condition (control) between

pre-training and post-training was compared using a paired t-test in the
ECR and FCR muscles, respectively. 
All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS statistics 20
for Windows (SPSS Inc. , Chicago, IL).  Statistical signiﬁcance was set at
a value of p < 0. 05 in all tests.

3. 1.  Process of construction of the task image
Fig.  3 shows the group data for the RMS as an indicator of construction of the task image by motor learning across the three performance tests.  One-factor repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect (F2,18 = 15. 378, p < 0. 001).  The post-hoc test
showed that the pre-test session was signiﬁcantly higher than that after
the 2nd training block (p < 0. 05) and post-training session
(p < 0. 05).  However, there was no signiﬁcant change between after
the 2nd training block and post-training session (p = 0. 165).

imagery condition (F4,36 = 6. 807, p < 0. 001).  Moreover, there was a
signiﬁcant main eﬀect of training (F1,9 = 6. 090, p < 0. 05) and the
imagery condition (F4,36 = 6. 647, p < 0. 001).  The post-hoc test
showed that the MEP ratio during motor imagery was signiﬁcantly
larger at time points II (p = 0. 008) and III (p < 0. 05) after training
than before training.  Upon comparison between the time points after
training, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence was seen between points II and IV
(p < 0. 05), and between points II and V (p < 0. 05), while a

In the ECR, the MEP amplitude in the resting condition was
0. 26 ± 0. 05 mV (mean ± the standard error) before training, and
0. 23 ± 0. 05 mV after training.  A paired t-test revealed a signiﬁcant
decrease in the MEP amplitude after training (p < 0. 05).  In the FCR,
the MEP amplitude in the resting condition was 0. 17 ± 0. 06 mV before training and 0. 11 ± 0. 03 mV after training (p = 0. 286). 
<Conclusion> Discussion. 
This study determined that the MEPs of the ECR (agonist muscle)
during motor imagery in the Increasing phase were signiﬁcantly larger
than that in the Decreasing phase, which indicates that corticospinal
excitability was modulated with the real-time changes in motor imagery during this force control task.  Furthermore, the changes after
motor learning training, which was required to construct the motor
imagery, were noticeable in the agonist muscle, but not in the antagonist muscle (FCR).  These results suggest that real-time modulation
of corticospinal excitability is a signiﬁcant eﬀect mediated by imagining the motor task. 
in the excitability of
A previous study reported that motor imagery produced a temporally modulated enhancement
the M1 representation of an intrinsic hand muscle, in a phasic task in which
rhythmic isometric contractions of the muscles were made in time with
a 1-Hz metronome [18].  A similar result was obtained here, indicating
that corticospinal excitability is modulated, speciﬁcally for the agonist
muscle and the time of force production.  Additionally, we have newly
clariﬁed that corticospinal excitability is modulated in a temporal
manner, depending on the status of force control; that is, depending on
whether the modulation occurs in the Increasing phase, peak of force,
or Decreasing phase. 
Mizuguchi Name [17] compared the MEPs during muscle contraction
imagery across force levels of 10%, 30%, and 60% MVC.  They noted
that MEPs during imagery at 60% MVC increased signiﬁcantly compared to those at 10% MVC, but there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between the 10% and 30% MVC conditions.  However, we found that
MEPs generated during 15% MVC imagery (the Increasing phase/time

Fig.  6.  Background electromyography (EMG) during motor imagery. 
The root-mean-square of the EMG expressed as arbitrary units (arb.  u)
during motor imagery recorded 100 ms before TMS (Background
EMG; B. EMG).  The bars show the average of B. EMG in the extensor
carpi radialis (ECR) (A) and ﬂexor carpi radialis (FCR) (B) muscles at
each stimulation time point (see also Fig.  1) during motor imagery and
the resting condition.  Error bars represent the standard error of thepoint II) were larger than those of the 30% MVC condition (peak force/
time point III).  Thus, our results suggest that the timing, rather than the
magnitude, of the force is the more inﬂuential factor in corticospinal
excitability in the force control task.  Sohn Name [20] reported that
excitatory corticospinal drive was suppressed during negative (suppressed movement) motor imagery.  Here, the Decreasing phase represented such suppressing activity, and it is possible that the described
suppression of corticospinal excitability in the Decreasing phase began
immediately prior to that phase, i. e. , at the peak time where the phase
switched from the Increasing phase to the following Decreasing phase. 
This could explain why greater corticospinal excitability was represented as larger MEPs at time point II than at time point III. 
Since there were no signiﬁcant eﬀects of training and imagery
conditions on the B. EMG of the ECR, it seems that there was no eﬀect of
muscle activity on MEP measurements.  In terms of FCR, the main eﬀect
of B. EMG in the imagery condition almost reached statistical signiﬁcance (p = 0. 057).  Although the cause of this ﬁnding was uncertain,
it might have been because the activity of the antagonist (FCR) occurred unconsciously, as it did not move during imaging the contraction
of the agonist muscle (ECR).  However, since there was no consistent
trend in the MEP ratios of the FCR during motor imagery conditions
(Fig.  5), the eﬀects of this phenomenon on our main results seem to beThe MEPs in the ECR muscle during the resting condition were
signiﬁcantly reduced after training.  We hypothesized that repetitive
training would act to suppress corticospinal excitability in the resting
condition.  Although the mechanism remains unclear, it is possible that
intracortical inhibitory control systems were involved.  According to
previous pharmacological and neurophysiological studies using the
paired-pulse TMS method, neuroplastic changes in the cerebral cortex
caused by motor learning was related to the reorganization of inhibitory interneuronal circuits, as represented by altered intracortical
GABAergic or glutamatergic interactions [21–23].  Since the tracking
task in this study contained elements of learning, the reduction of MEP
amplitudes during the resting condition was probably related to the
above phenomenon.  Further studies should also investigate the mechanism underlying cerebral cortical control systems represented by
short-interval intracortical inhibition during motor imagery of a force
control task. 
The present study suﬀered from several limitations that are inherent
and somewhat unavoidable when associated with studies utilizing
motor imagery tasks.  Because task learning is necessary to guarantee
the execution of the motor imagery task, we could not diﬀerentiate the
eﬀects of task learning on cortical excitability from those of the phasedependency changes of corticospinal excitability that we aimed to examine [24,25].  Despite this limitation, we believe that the imagery
force control phase-dependence of cortical excitability is a robustIn conclusion, this study provided novel information demonstrating
that corticospinal excitability changes that depend on the phase of the
imagined force control task and it is marked after motor imagery has
been established.
