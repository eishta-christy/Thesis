d The transcription of fbxl4 in lLNvs is CLOCK dependent
d Fbxl4 regulates sleep through rhythmically modulating the
excitability of lLNvs
In Brief
The circadian clock regulates the timing
of sleep, but the underlying mechanisms
are still not fully understood.  Li Name
showed that CLOCK-dependent Fbxl4
expression rhythmically downregulated
GABAA receptors to increase the activity
of pacemaker neurons and promote
wakefulness.

https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 10. 052The timing of sleep is tightly governed by the circadian clock, which contains a negative transcriptional
feedback loop and synchronizes the physiology and
behavior of most animals to daily environmental
oscillations.  However, how the circadian clock determines the timing of sleep is largely unclear.  In vertebrates and invertebrates, the status of sleep and
wakefulness is modulated by the electrical activity
of pacemaker neurons that are circadian regulated
and suppressed by inhibitory GABAergic inputs. 
Here, we showed that Drosophila GABAA receptors
undergo rhythmic degradation in arousal-promoting
large ventral lateral neurons (lLNvs) and their expression level in lLNvs displays a daily oscillation.  We also
demonstrated that the E3 ligase Fbxl4 promotes
GABAA receptor ubiquitination and degradation and
revealed that the transcription of fbxl4 in lLNvs is
CLOCK dependent.
