The incidence of stress-related disorders, such as depression, is approximately twice as high in women as in men [1,2].  In addition, the
symptoms and pharmacological treatments of these conditions diﬀer in
both sexes [3].  This disparity could be due to physiological and behavioral sexual diﬀerences in response to the same stressor or diﬀerences
in the stimuli perceived as stressful [4–6].  Despite these ﬁndings, the
contribution of these diﬀerences to the development of stress-related
disorders in women is poorly understood.  This lack of knowledge may
be due to bias toward males in research in this ﬁeld, perhaps because of
the need for a homogeneous sample devoid of hormonal ﬂuctuations
[7] or the lack of a social stress model appropriate for females. 
Chronic social stress is considered the most common etiological
factor in the precipitation of depressive disorders in humans [8].  In
preclinical studies, a commonly used animal model of social stress is

social defeat in male rodents.  This model is based on the resident-intruder paradigm, where subjects interact aggressively to establish
dominance over the territory [9].  This model has been very useful in
establishing the mechanisms underlying depressive symptoms [10,11]
but is not considered adequate to induce chronic social stress in females
because females do not exhibit territorial aggression [12,13].  Given the
importance of social support in coping with stress in females [6], the
disruption of the social network may be a more valid social stressor. 
Thus, the chronic social instability stress model used in rats [12] and
mice [14] seems to be a better suited stress model given the social
nature of females.  This model consists of interrupting the animals’ social network, alternating periods of
isolation and crowding with
membership rotation.
