Psychosocial stressors such as being exposed to social evaluative
threat have repeatedly been shown to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which plays an important role linking stress
and inﬂammation.  Importantly, chronic exposure to stressful life circumstances is often accompanied by systemic low-grade inﬂammation
which constitutes an antecedent of stress-related disease (Rohleder,
2014), thus illustrating the importance of being able to cope eﬀectively
with everyday stress in order to anticipate adverse health outcomes.  In
light of these relationships, research has focused on coping styles or
traits to explain inter-individual diﬀerences in HPA axis regulation in
order to provide an explanatory approach for individual vulnerability
to pathophysiological consequences of repeated physiological stress
reactions. 
HPA axis activity during stress as characterized by a quick rise and
decline of glucocorticoid levels is thought to be adaptive in terms of
maintaining physiological stability when facing environmental demands.  As described by the allostatic load model (McEwen, 1998;
Sterling & Eyer, 1988) these allostatic processes have a potential cost to
the body, when regulated ineﬃciently or when repeated or chronic
stress requires adaptational reactions to be activated too frequently
(McEwen, 2000; McEwen & Stellar, 1993). 
On the one hand, associations between physiological stress responses and mental and physical health impairments such as major
depression (for a review, see Burke, Davis, Otte, & Mohr, 2005) or
chronic fatigue syndrome (for a review, see Tomas, Newton, & Watson,
2013) have been elucidated cross-sectionally, while prospective studies
revealing a direct path between heightened stress induced HPA axis
responses and disease progression in later life, on the other hand, are
lacking.  However, a prolonged cortisol secretion as a consequence of
repeated or chronic stress experience or to an impaired down-regulation of the HPA axis after stress exposure is thought to prevent the body
from recovering from stress appropriately which leads to suppression of
immune functions (Sapolsky, Romero, & Munck, 2000) as well as increased susceptibility to diseases (Cohen, Janicki-Deverts, & Miller,Promising and indirect evidence arises from longitudinal studies
that account for an increased disease risk among individuals exhibiting
stronger stress-induced increases of inﬂammatory proteins such as interleukin-6 and ﬁbrinogen (Brydon & Steptoe, 2005) as well as greater

Cortisol secretion as an index of HPA axis activation, in turn, indicates
how stress activates biological stress-systems and acts as a major regulator of inﬂammation (Sapolsky, Romero, & Munck, 2000), which itself increases the risk of developing stress-related diseases.  In this
context, it is of special interest how stress-induced cortisol secretion
might be modulated by cognitive responses to stress (i. e.  coping). 
time and situations
Coping has originally been deﬁned as cognitive and behavioral efforts to deal with stress (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).  Besides this initial
process-oriented approach, which perceives coping as dynamic process
depending on appraisals and reappraisals of stress situations, authors
frequently deﬁne the construct as coping styles or personality traits that
are stable across
(Krohne, 1993; Miller,
Combs, & Kruus, 1993).  Coping has been proposed as a determinant for
both mental and physical health (Folkman & Moskowitz, 2000, 2004),
and increasing interest in investigating the association between coping
and health outcomes has emerged.  The results from studies assessing
the relationship between coping styles and aﬀect in healthy participants, for example, reveal positive associations between problem/accommodation coping and positive aﬀect as well as between avoidance/
disengagement coping and negative aﬀect (e. g.  Ben-Zur, 1999, 2002). 
Furthermore, forms of avoidance and emotion-focused coping have
been shown to predict lower well-being (Mayordomo, Viguer, Sales,
Satorres, & Meléndez, 2016; Mayordomo-Rodríguez, Meléndez-Moral,
Viguer-Segui, & Sales-Galán, 2015; Zeidner, Matthews, & Shemesh,
2015) while task- and problem-oriented coping predict higher wellbeing (Goodarzi, Shokri, & Shariﬁ, 2015; Mayordomo-Rodríguez Name,A limited number of studies also reveal associations between
(avoidance) coping and indicators of physical health (for a review, see
Penley, Tomaka, & Wiebe, 2002).  Kohlmann, Weidner, and Messina
(1996), for example, showed that avoidance coping was associated with
greater systolic blood pressure reactivity during a laboratory speech
session.  In addition, the results from Vitaliano, Russo, Paulsen, and
Bailey (1995) indicate a relationship between avoidance coping and
slower cardiovascular recovery (diastolic blood pressure and heart rate)
to emotional and cognitive tasks among older adults.  As demonstrated
by Birditt, Nevitt, and Almeida (2015), avoidance coping further entails
delayed eﬀects with lower well-being and higher cortisol when having
an interpersonal tension the previous day.  Stowell, Kiecolt-Glaser, and
Glaser (2001) found a signiﬁcant interaction between perceived stress
and active/avoidance coping on proliferative immune responses.  Taken
together, studies show that indicators of both mental and physical
health are positively associated with forms of task- and problem-oriented coping while avoidance- and emotion-focused coping styles are
proposed as negative correlates of health-related parameters. 
Few studies have investigated coping styles in relationship with
HPA axis reactivity to natural and laboratory stressors.  As described
below and summarized by Biondi and Picardi (1999), it has been consistently demonstrated that HPA axis reactivity in response to both
types of stressors is modulated by coping style.  For instance, Bohnen,
Nicolson, Sulon, and Jolles (1991) examined the association between
coping styles and cortisol responses of healthy female participants
during a 4-h continuous mental stress task.  Cortisol response was found
to be negatively correlated with the emotion-focused coping style described as “comforting cognitions”.  Moreover, Nicolson (1992) explored the association between coping styles and HPA axis activity over
the course of three diﬀerent examination situations.  While no association between coping styles and cortisol reactivity was found, the results
reveal a stronger cortisol decline among participants with a high aﬃnity to “problem-oriented” coping style as well as a weaker decline
among participants scoring high on the dimensions “distraction” and
“comforting cognitions”.  In a more recent study, Höhne Name (2014)
examined the modulating eﬀect of coping styles on HPA axis activity in
response to two consecutive Trier Social Stress TestsKirschbaum, Pirke, & Hellhammer, 1993) which constitutes a standard
protocol for the experimental induction of psychosocial stress.  In acombined group consisting of both individuals with a remitted major
depression and healthy controls, the extent of negative coping (e. g. 
rumination, self-blame) positively predicted cortisol response both
during reactivity and recovery.  Other studies, in turn, did not ﬁnd relationships between coping styles and HPA axis stress responses
(Bossert Name, 1988; van Eck Name, 1996).  To sum up, active, direct,
and problem-focused coping strategies are correlated with reduced
psychoendocrine reactivity, while avoidant- and denial-oriented coping
strategies

associated with elevated HPA axisSince variation in HPA axis activity in acute stress-situations arises
from various situation-speciﬁc appraisals such as threat and challenge
(Gaab, Rohleder, Nater, & Ehlert, 2005), actual coping behavior may
vary according to subjective appraisals of own competence and control
expectancies and, in turn, deviate from habitual and established coping
styles.  As illustrated by Erdmann and Janke (2008) coping can be
considered as states, as well, whereby the way of coping strongly depends on speciﬁc characteristics of stress situations which has been
shown to result in instable factor-analytic integrations of coping responses.  Despite the importance of coping skills for healthy psychological and physiological functioning, no study to date has investigated
the role of situational coping eﬀorts when predicting endocrine stress
reactivity and recovery.  To better understand the role of coping as
determinant of stress responses and to evaluate the eﬃciency of actual
coping responses with regard to physiological functioning, individual
coping approaches during acute stress situations have to be taken into
account when exploring the etiology of disease.  Identifying potential
stress-buﬀering coping responses, in turn, might enable to systematically promote adequate coping behavior. 
In summary, studies reveal that variation in HPA axis activity in
response to psychosocial stress is modulated by coping style.  Since
coping styles do not shed light on the eﬃciency of coping eﬀorts, state
coping responses must be taken into consideration when exploring
stress-buﬀering coping responses.  Since the factor structure of state
coping dimensions is instable and varies across study settings and
samples (Erdmann & Janke, 2008), the ﬁrst aim of the present study
was to identify state coping dimensions that indicate representative
responses to acute psychosocial stress.  As increased stress reactions as
well as insuﬃcient recovery from acute stress have been proposed as
antecedents of stress-related disease such as cardiovascular disease, and
cancer (Cohen Name, 2007), it is of particular interest whether variation
in HPA axis activity can be explained by diﬀerent types of situational
coping behavior.  A further aim of the present study was therefore to test
the hypothesis whether diﬀerent manifestations of state coping predict
diﬀerences in cortisol response and recovery (i. e.  baseline cortisol level,
slope, decrease) in an acute psychosocial stress situation.

2. 1.  Participants
recruited from the
Participants (N = 61, mean age = 22. 92, SD = 4. 34, 60. 7% female) were
Friedrich-Alexander-University
Erlangen-Nürnberg campus via print and multi-media advertising and
received monetary compensation.  Before testing, eligibility was assessed by an online screening-questionnaire.  Participants were invited
to a laboratory session if they met the following inclusion criteria: 1)
minimum age of 18 years, 2) non-smoker, 3) Body Mass Index (BMI)
between 18 and 30 kg/m2, 4) no drug intake (e. g.  beta blocker, glucocorticoids, anti-depressants), with the exception of hormonal contraceptives in women, 5) absence of physical or mental disorders, 6) no
previous experience with the stress protocol, and 6) self-reported depression.  To exclude eﬀects of depression on stress responses (Burke
Name, 2005), we used the German version of the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloﬀ, 1977) termed
“AllgemeineDepressionsskala”Hautzinger,

Hofmeister, & Keller, 2012) during the screening process, and did not
invite participants with scores > 22 for participation, since scores
above this cutoﬀ indicate the presence of depressive symptomatology
(Hautzinger Name, 2012). 
Two participants later had to be excluded from analyses.  One due to
elevated cortisol levels after arrival at the laboratory (z > 3. 29), another one due to insuﬃcient saliva sample volume.  The ﬁnal sample
consisted of 59 participants (mean age = 22. 93, SD = 4. 41, 59. 3%

can be summarized into 13 coping categories which can be clustered
into two broad coping styles (positive and negative coping). 
2. 3. 3.  Chronic stress
A German version of the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen,
Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983) was used to assess chronic stress over
the past four weeks.  In this questionnaire participants were asked to
indicate how often they felt, for example, nervous and stressed during
the last month.  Ratings are made on a 5-point Likert scale from “never“
to “very often” and after reverse coding four items, overall sum scores
were computed. 
2. 2.  Procedures
All participants were scheduled between 1:00 p. m.  and 7:00 p. m.  to
control for circadian variations in HPA axis activity.  After arrival at the
laboratory, participants were accommodated in a comfortable armchair
and received verbal and written instructions.  Informed consent was
obtained and participants provided a baseline saliva sample. 
Participants then rested for 30 min, provided a ﬁrst saliva sample
(−1 min) and were then introduced to the TSST in a standardized way. 
Additional saliva samples were collected +1, +10, +20, +30, +45
and +60 min after the TSST.  At the end of each laboratory session,
participants were debriefed and dismissed. 
2. 2. 1.  Acute stress induction
After the accommodation period of 30 min, and after taking the ﬁrst
saliva sample, participants were guided to a testing room, and were
introduced to a selection committee consisting of one female and one
male observer wearing white lab coats.  Participants were instructed to
take the role of a job applicant and to give a ﬁve-minute speech in order
to present themselves as best candidate for a vacant position (i. e.  their
“dream job”).  They were given ﬁve minutes to prepare for their talk,
after which they were instructed to stand in front the panel and to begin
their speech.  Subsequently, participants were given a mental arithmetic
task for additional ﬁve minutes.  They were asked to serially subtract 17
from 2043 as quickly as possible.  In the case of any error, they were
requested to start over again.  In general, the panel remained neutral
and provided no feedback during the entire task.  However, if the participant fell silent, the panel speaker followed a pre-deﬁned standard
procedure including standardized silence and standardized questions. 
Additionally, both the ﬁve-minute speech, as well as the mental arithmetic task, were audio- and videotaped for further analyses. 
2. 3.  Measures
2. 3. 1.  State copingtheGerman-language
Ten minutes after stress exposure, state-dependent coping was assessed
questionnaire
“Stressverarbeitungsfragebogen” (SVF 42-ak; Erdmann & Janke, 2008). 
This 42-item questionnaire is designed to measure 21 diﬀerent coping
responses which were exhibited in a preceding stress situation, making
it appropriate for a retrospective assessment.  In this questionnaire
participants are asked to indicate how likely coping-related thoughts
such as “I try to control/antagonize my arousal” came to their mind in
the previous stress situation.  Ratings are made on a 4-point Likert scale
from “not at all” to “certainly” and ﬁnal scores are computed by summing scores on each subtest (i. e.  coping response). 
2. 3. 2.  Trait coping
To assess dispositional coping styles, a trait version of the Germanlanguage coping questionnaire “Stressverarbeitungsfragebogen” (SVF
78; Erdmann & Janke, 2008) was used.  This 78-item questionnaire
measures on a 5-point Likert scale (from “not at all” to “most likely”)
how likely an individual reacts (e. g.  “I tend to escape”) when being
aﬀected, irritated or unsettled by something or someone.  Item scores2. 3. 4.  Self-reported depressive symptoms
To assess depressive symptoms, we used the 20-item ADS-L
(German version of the CES-D; Hautzinger Name, 2012; Radloﬀ, 1977). 
This scale measures how often participants experienced depressive
symptoms such as “I was afraid“ during the past seven days on a 4-point
Likert scale (from “rarely or not at all” to “mostly/at all times”).  After
reverse coding four items, overall sum scores were computed. 
2. 3. 5.  Rumination
Additional measures of trait and state rumination were obtained in
order to control for potential confounding eﬀects by coping-related
behavior after stress. 
Trait rumination was assessed using the German version of the
Response Style Questionnaire (RSQ; Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow,
1991) from Kuehner and Weber (1999).  In this questionnaire participants are asked to indicate on a 4-point Likert scale (from “almost
never” to “almost always”) how often they tend to 32 diﬀerent responses such as “I think about how hard it is to concentrate” when
feeling depressed or experiencing negative emotions. 
In order to assess state rumination, a German version of a modiﬁed
post-event rumination scale (Abbott & Rapee, 2004; Edwards Name,
2003) was used.  Participants rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging
from “never” to “very often” how frequently they thought about different aspects of their speech.  The questionnaire comprises two subscales including 10 positive items (e. g.  “My speech was good”) and 15
negative items (e. g.  “I looked stupid”).  Positive items were reverse
coded so that higher scores indicate more frequent rumination. 
2. 3. 6.  Salivary cortisol
HPA axis stress responses were assessed by measuring changes of
salivary cortisol concentrations over the course of a laboratory session. 
Saliva samples were collected via Salivettes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht,
Germany) and were stored for later analyses at −18 °C after laboratory
sessions.  Samples were centrifuged at 2000g and 20 °C for ﬁve minutes. 
Salivary cortisol concentrations were determined in duplicate using
chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA, IBL, Hamburg, Germany). 
Intra- and inter-assay CVs were below 10%. 
2. 4.  Statistical analyses
Preliminary data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics
23 (Chicago, Illinois, USA).  In the ﬁrst step, data was screened for
outliers using z-scores.  One participant was excluded due to elevated
cortisol levels after arrival at the laboratory (z > 3. 29).  KolmogorovSmirnov (KS) tests were conducted in order to check for normal distribution.  Cortisol data were log-transformed with the purpose of reducing skewness.  All subsequent data analyses were conducted with
these transformed data.  To estimate the number of factors, principal
component analyses (PCA) with varimax rotation were performed on 20
subtests from the SVF 42-ak for the complete sample of 61 study participants.  Extraction criteria were 1) factor loadings above 0. 45, and 2)
at least three factor loadings per factor (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). 
Endocrine stress responses were analyzed by conducting repeated
measures analyses of variance (rmANOVA) with time (-1, +1, +10,

assess the inﬂuence of coping dimensions on mean cortisol concentration (intercept π0i), rate of change (slope π1i) and curvature (acceleration π2i) both during stress reaction (−1 to +10 min relative to TSST)
and stress recovery (+10 to +60 min relative to TSST), two separate
growth curve models were analyzed using HLM 7. 01 (Scientiﬁc Software International, Inc.
