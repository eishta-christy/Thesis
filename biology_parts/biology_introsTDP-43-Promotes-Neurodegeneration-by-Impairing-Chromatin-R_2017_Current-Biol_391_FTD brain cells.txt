https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 10. 024Regulation of chromatin structure is critical for brain
development and function.  However, the involvement of chromatin dynamics in neurodegeneration
is less well understood.  Here we ﬁnd, launching
from Drosophila models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, that TDP-43 impairs the induction of multiple key stress genes
required to protect from disease by reducing the
recruitment of the chromatin remodeler Chd1 to
chromatin.  Chd1 depletion robustly enhances TDP43-mediated neurodegeneration and promotes the
formation of stress granules.  Conversely, upregulation of Chd1 restores nucleosomal dynamics,
promotes normal
induction of protective stress
genes, and rescues stress sensitivity of TDP-43-expressing animals.  TDP-43-mediated impairments
are conserved in mammalian cells, and, importantly,
the human ortholog CHD2 physically interacts with
TDP-43 and is strikingly reduced in level in temporal
cortex of human patient
tissue.  These ﬁndings
indicate that TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration
causes impaired chromatin dynamics that prevents
appropriate expression of protective genes through
compromised function of the chromatin remodeler
Chd1/CHD2.  Enhancing chromatin dynamics may
be a treatment approach to amyotrophic lateral
scleorosis (ALS)/frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 
INTRODUCTION
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable, relentlessly
progressing neurodegenerative disease, leading to death within
3–5 years of diagnosis in most cases [1, 2].  In ALS, the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons leads to muscle atrophy,
weakness, and eventually paralysis.  Although predominantly a
motor disorder, 20% of ALS cases also develop cognitive deficits that resemble those seen in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 
Strikingly, ALS and select FTD subtypes share the pathological
hallmark of ubiquitinated inclusions composed of TDP-43 protein, encoded by the TARDBP gene [3]. 
The discovery of TARDBP mutations in ALS and FTD [4, 5]
demonstrates that TDP-43 plays causal roles in the pathogenesis of these diseases.  Therefore, understanding the molecular
events underlying TDP-43 toxicity is of special
importance. 
Indeed, abnormal TDP-43 levels and localization are toxic to
neurons [6], elicit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [7], and
impair multiple cellular processes, including axonal transport
[8], mitochondrial function [9], and RNA metabolism [10].  TDP43 is a ubiquitously expressed RNA- and DNA-binding protein,
with primarily nuclear localization.  Interestingly, TDP-43 was
originally identiﬁed as a transcriptional
[11], but
DNA-related functions of TDP-43 remain largely unexplored. 
repressor
Proper chromatin regulation is critical for gene expression in
the brain [12, 13], and various epigenetic mechanisms including
DNA methylation [14], histone acetylation [15], and histone
variant exchange [16] have been shown to control memory formation and consolidation.  Recent observations also point to
possible altered histone methylation and acetylation having a
role during brain degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease [17] and
in models of tauopathies [18].  Chromatin remodeling is carried
out by a large family of ATP-dependent enzymes that modify
chromatin structure by depositing, sliding, and evicting histones
[19].  Mutations in multiple chromatin remodelers are associated
with human mental disorders, suggesting that imbalance of
neuronal chromatin structure and the ensuing alterations in
gene expression are detrimental to brain function [20].  The
CHD family of chromatin remodelers is characterized by tandem
chromodomains in the N-terminal region and a central catalytic
domain with homology to the canonical SNF2-like ATPase
domain.  Vertebrates contain CHD1 and CHD2, which form a
unique subfamily due to the presence of a C-terminal DNA-binding domain [21], whereas in invertebrates only one gene, Chd1,Here we took an unbiased screening approach to askwhether chromatin regulatory proteins might be critical

neurodegeneration.  We ﬁnd an unexpected role of TDP-43 in impairing Chd1-dependent chromatin dynamics at stress genes,
thus reducing the protective stress response and promoting
neurodegeneration.  We also ﬁnd a striking loss of CHD2 in human FTD cortex, indicating that impaired chromatin remodeling
may be a key event in ALS/FTD. 
<Middle> RESULTS. 
TDP-43 Toxicity Is Modulated by H3K4me3-Related
Genes in Drosophila
We performed an in vivo RNAi screen in which we reduced
expression of 84 genes related to various aspects of chromatin
regulation in a Drosophila model of ALS/FTD (Table S1; genes
were selected as in [22]).  The gene set included histone methyltransferases, demethylases, acetyltransferases (HATs), and deacetylases (HDACs), as well as associated factors, histones, and
chromatin remodelers.  We expressed TDP-43 in the ﬂy eye with
the binary GAL4/UAS expression system.  Such ﬂies show progressive retinal deterioration that can be visualized externally,
providing a simple and rapid readout of TDP-43 toxicity and
potential gene enhancers or suppressors [23].  We followed the
screen with secondary tests using a model of TDP-43-mediated
brain degeneration. 
Following exclusion of RNAi lines that affected eye integrity on
their own, the screen uncovered 31 modiﬁers, 4 of which we
classiﬁed as ‘‘strong’’ and 27 as ‘‘mild’’ based on eye structure
(Figure 1A).  The modiﬁers, both enhancers and suppressors of
TDP-43 toxicity, included a range of genes from most of the
tested functional categories.  However, we noted that six modiﬁers were related to histone H3 trimethyl lysine 4 (H3K4me3; Figure 1A), a mark associated with active gene expression [24].  Two
strong modiﬁers were lid and Chd1 (Figures 1B and 1C): knockdown of lid, an H3K4me3 demethylase [25], strongly suppressed
TDP-43 toxicity, whereas knockdown of Chd1, a chromatin ATPdependent remodeling factor associated with H3K4me3 [26],
enhanced TDP-43 toxicity (Figures 1B and 1C).  Knockdown of
three components of COMPASS (conserved multiprotein complexes that mediate methylation of H3K4 [27]) showed mild
enhancement of TDP-43 toxicity.  These were Set1, the major
H3K4me3 lysine methyltransferase [28], and the subunits ash2
and Wdr82 (Figure S1A).  Taken together, these genetic interactions suggested that gain of H3K4 methylation suppressed
toxicity, whereas toxicity was enhanced by loss of H3K4 methylation or function. 
To assess the speciﬁcity of these interactions, we manipulated
other chromatin marks and examined TDP-43-mediated degeneration.  These data showed that modulation of genes that alter
methylation of H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, or H3K79 had no effect
on TDP-43 toxicity (Figure S1B).  Furthermore, knockdown of
Su(var)3-3, which demethylates mono and dimethyl H3K4 [29],
also had little effect on TDP-43 toxicity (Figure S1A). 
The efﬁciency of lid and Chd1 knockdown was conﬁrmed using real-time qRT-PCR (Figure S1C).  We focused additional analyses on lid and Chd1 because of their strong modulation of
TDP43.  Modulation by lid and Chd1 was speciﬁc to TDP-43,
because reduction of lid or Chd1 on their own did not affect
integrity of the eye (Figure S1D) and did not impact the toxicity
of another neurodegenerative disease protein, Tau (Figure S1D). 
3580 Current Biology 27, 3579–3590, December 4, 2017
Furthermore, lid and Chd1 knockdown did not alter TDP-43
levels or nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning (Figures S1E and
S1F).  Thus, the screen identiﬁed a selective genetic interaction
between TDP-43 and chromatin factors related speciﬁcally to
the H3K4me3 chromatin mark. 
We next tested whether manipulation of lid and Chd1 could
alter TDP-43 toxicity in the nervous system.  Expression of
TDP-43 using the neuronal driver elav-Gal4 shortened lifespan
and impaired motor abilities (chamber wall climbing).  Knockdown of Chd1 further shortened lifespan and further impaired
motor function, whereas lid knockdown prolonged lifespan and
mitigated motor dysfunction (Figure 1D; Figure S1G).  Importantly, Chd1 and lid knockdown on their own had no effect on
lifespan (Figure 1E). 
lid and Set1,
We considered the possibility that TDP-43 expression itself
affected the level of the H3K4me3 mark.  We therefore examined the levels of H3K4me3 in brains of animals expressing
TDP-43, compared to knockdown ofH3K4me3 demethylase and methyltransferase, respectively. 
Although there was a striking effect of both lid and Set1 in
modulating brain H3K4me3 levels, TDP-43 expression had no
effect (Figure 1F).  Chd1 depletion does not affect H3K4me3
levels [30].  Furthermore, in the background of TDP-43 expression, knockdown of lid, Set1, and Chd1 exerted similar effects
on H3K4me3 as they did in control ﬂies (Figure S1H).  These
data suggested that it is not the level of H3K4me3 that is
important but rather functional
interactions, for example the
recruitment of remodeling factors to chromatin that might be
especially relevant, given the identiﬁcation of Chd1 as a strong
TDP-43 modiﬁer. 
TDP-43 Mediates Stress Response Impairments
via Chd1
Chd1 is a nucleosome remodeling enzyme of the SNF2 family;
human CHD1 speciﬁcally binds to H3K4me3 [26], and
Drosophila Chd1 largely overlaps with H3K4me3 on chromatin
[31].  However, given that global levels of H3K4me3 were unaffected by TDP-43, our ﬁndings raised the possibility that select
targets of Chd1 might be of special importance to TDP-43-associated toxicity.  Intriguingly, Chd1 is linked to gene induction
following stress [30, 32], and molecular chaperones are crucial
in neurodegenerative processes [33–35].  TDP-43, like numerous
other degenerative disease proteins, is aggregation prone, and
several heat shock proteins protect against its toxicity [36–40]. 
In accordance with these studies, we found that upregulation
of Hsc4 and Hsp68 suppressed TDP-43 toxicity (Figures S2A
and S2B).  We conﬁrmed that Chd1 loss impairs the induction
of heat shock genes in adult ﬂies, as shown previously in larvae
[30] (Figure S2C).  These data raised the possibility that the Chd1
and TDP-43 genetic interaction may involve stress pathways,
and that impaired Chd1 function could limit the cellular stress
response to various insults. 
During stress, TDP-43 accumulates in stress granules (SGs),
which are cytoplasmic, non-membrane-bound assemblies of
proteins and mRNAs and that are stalled in translation initiation
[41].  Therapeutic inhibition of SGs mitigates TDP-43-mediated
neurodegeneration [42].  We therefore tested whether Chd1
might be involved in SG formation.  We used Drosophila S2R+
cells [43], and developed an automated SG analysis pipeline

(Figure 2A) did not induce SG formation on its own (Figure 2C). 
However, upon treatment with 0. 2 mM sodium arsenite, a wellcharacterized inducer of SG formation, Chd1 knockdown significantly increased the number of SGs per cell, SG size, and percentage of cells that exhibit visible SGs (Figures 2C and 2D;

highly sensitive to paraquat-induced
oxidative stress as well as to starvation
(Figure S2D), suggesting that TDP-43
induced severe impairments to multiple
stress response pathways.  These data
further indicated that the Chd1 and TDP43 genetic interaction may reﬂect modulation of stress response genes. 
To examine the molecular basis of
this sensitivity, we subjected animals to
heat shock and analyzed the dynamics
of gene expression of the molecular chaperones.  Without added stress, TDP-43
caused a moderate and signiﬁcant
upregulation of several heat shock genes
(Figure 3F).  Upon heat stress, the expression of these genes
increased dramatically.  However, the mRNA levels of Hsp23,
Hsp27, Hsp40, Hsp68, Hsp70 loci, and Hsp83 were consistently
lower in TDP-43 animals compared to controls following stress
(Figures 3F and 3G; Figures S2H and S2I; data are presented
relative to control non-heat shock).  Thus, induction of heat shock
gene expression is impaired by TDP-43.  Upregulation of Chd1
could restore stress gene induction to animals expressing
TDP-43: importantly, the level of gene expression returned to
nearly control levels in TDP-43 + Chd1-OE (Figure 3G; Figures
S2H and S2I), consistent with the ability of Chd1 to protect
TDP-43 animals from physiological heat stress (Figure 3C).  The
induction of several Hsps, such as Hsp67, was unaltered by
TDP-43 (Figure S2E), showing speciﬁcity in effects.  Supporting
the unique role of the stress response in TDP-43 toxicity, ﬂies expressing Tau (wild-type or R406W mutant) had normal heat
shock gene induction (Figure S2G). 
To determine whether these effects of TDP-43 were conserved
in mammalian cells, we utilized human embryonic kidney
(HEK) 293T cells that express GFP-tagged wild-type TDP-43
Figure S3).  These data conﬁrmed that Chd1 function may be critical during the stress response. 
To examine the functional importance of Chd1 during stress,
we subjected Chd1 homozygous null ﬂies to 2 hr of heat stressC and allowed them to recover overnight (Figure 3A). Control animals recovered almost completely, whereas loss of
Chd1 dramatically impaired survival (Figure 3B).  Knockdown of
Chd1 similarly resulted in impaired survival following stress (Figure 3B).  We then asked whether stress sensitivity is a feature of
animals expressing TDP-43.  Strikingly, conditional expression of
TDP-43 in adult animals also resulted in hypersensitivity to heat
stress, with high lethality after overnight recovery (Figure 3C);
Chd1 knockdown further increased lethality, whereas increased
expression of Chd1 (Chd1-OE) dramatically reduced lethality of
TDP-43 ﬂies (Figure 3C).  The increased sensitivity of TDP-43 animals to stress was selective, and not a general feature of animals undergoing neurodegeneration, because expression of
the neurodegenerative disease protein Tau (wild-type or the
FTD-Tau-related mutation R406W) did not result in sensitivity
to heat stress (Figures 3D and 3E).  TDP-43 animals were also

(HSP40 member B1), HSPA1A (HSP70 protein 1A), and HSPA6

that in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, TDP-43 impairs
the induction of major stress genes, notably HSP70. 
TDP-43 Impairs Chromatin Dynamics
The ability of a chromatin remodeling factor, Chd1, to modulate
TDP-43-mediated impairments in stress gene induction raised
the possibility that TDP-43 may impact chromatin structure at
these genes.  We focused on Hsp70 because it is a highly
induced, canonical stress gene.  Upon heat shock, nucleosomes
along the gene body are rapidly removed to allow transcription
by paused RNA polymerase II [44].  We therefore tested whether
these nucleosome dynamics are impacted by TDP-43.  Using
micrococcal nuclease protection followed by qPCR (MNase3584 Current Biology 27, 3579–3590, December 4, 2017
qPCR; Figure 4A), we conﬁrmed that histones are rapidly cleared
(approximately 4-fold decrease) over the Hsp70 gene body upon
heat shock of adult Drosophila (Figure 4B).  We then conditionally
expressed TDP-43 and analyzed nucleosomal positioning under
ambient temperatures or following 10 min of heat stress.  Without
heat stress, TDP-43 caused a mild but signiﬁcant clearance of
nucleosomes (Figure 4B), in accordance with its effects on
gene expression (see Figure 3F).  Strikingly, under stress, TDP43 induced a strong impairment in histone clearance along the
Hsp70 gene body (Figure 4B), which was also consistent with
the reduction in gene expression in TDP-43-expressing animals
at this time point.  In accordance with the ability of Chd1-OE to
rescue heat shock sensitivity and gene induction in TDP-43-expressing animals, added Chd1 restored histone clearance (Figure 4B).  Analysis of a second locus, Hsp40, yielded similar
effects (Figure S4A).  These data suggest that TDP-43 impairs
in TetON-HEK293 cells (Figure 3H), we performed MNase protection to ask whether nucleosomal dynamics was also affected
in human cells.  Chromatin clearance ahead of RNA polymerase
has been previously described for human HSP70 in response to
heat stress of cultured cells [45], suggesting that this gene is a
suitable system with which to study chromatin dynamics in
C and 1-hr
mammalian cells.  Following a 1-hr heat stress at 46
recovery at 37
C, we found reduced nucleosomal occupancy
at the promoter and gene body of HSPA6 and HSPA1A, two human HSP70 genes (Figure S4E).  Expression of TDP-43 impaired
the clearance of nucleosomes at both of these genes (Figure S4E).  Therefore, impaired chromatin dynamics by TDP-43
is conserved in mammalian cells. 
TDP-43 Impairs Recruitment of Chd1 to Chromatin
Chd1 is recruited to heat shock loci and associates with regions
of high transcriptional activity [46].  In light of our ﬁndings, we hypothesized that TDP-43 may impact recruitment of Chd1 to
chromatin.  To test this, we employed a hemagglutinin (HA)tagged Chd1 genomic transgene expressed via the endogenous
Chd1 promoter and followed in vivo chromatin association of
Chd1 utilizing an anti-HA antibody.  ChIP-qPCR analysis across
the Hsp70 gene conﬁrmed that Chd1-HA recruitment over the
Hsp70 gene body coincided with the clearance of histone H3
(Figures S4F and S4G), consistent with the role of Chd1 in nucleosome remodeling at Hsp70 [30].  We then used ChIP-qPCR to
compare Chd1 association with the Hsp70 gene between control
ﬂies and ﬂies expressing TDP-43.  Whereas the association of
Chd1 with the Hsp70 gene body was normally robust upon
stress, the presence of TDP-43 resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction
in Chd1 association (Figure 4E), despite normal overall levels of
Chd1 (Figures S5A and S5B).  Taken together with the impaired
eviction of nucleosomes and the hypersensitivity of TDP-43 animals to stress, these data suggest that reduced levels of Chd1
on Hsp gene bodies during stress impair chromatin dynamics,
leading to reduced transcription of Hsp genes.  Thus, animals
with sub-optimal levels of stress response gene expression will
be hypersensitive to insult, which will manifest in increased
mortality. 
TDP-43 and Drosophila Chd1/Human CHD2 Physically
Interact
A mechanism underlying reduced Chd1 recruitment to chromatin
might involve physical interactions between TDP-43 and Chd1. 
We examined interactions in soluble and chromatin fractions, using co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) in extracts derived from whole
ﬂies.  Intriguingly, TDP-43 coIP Chd1-HA primarily in the soluble
fraction (Figure 5B), although TDP-43 was localized to both the
soluble and chromatin fractions (Figure 5B).  IP with an IgG control
as well as western immunoblot against b-tubulin demonstrated
the selectivity of the interaction.  coIPs with anti-TDP-43 antibodies in ﬂies that do not express TDP-43 did not pull down
Chd1-HA, conﬁrming speciﬁcity (Figure S5C).  These data suggest that TDP-43 may physically prevent proper recruitment of
Chd1 to stress genes, and are consistent with TDP-43-dependent compromise of nucleosome remodeling (see Figure 4) and
dampened stress-related gene expression (see Figure 3). 
Vertebrates,
including humans, encode two orthologs of
Chd1: CHD1 and CHD2 (Figure 5A).  Between these, mutations

(A) Human CHD1 and CHD2 are orthologs of Drosophila Chd1. 
(B) Adult Drosophila soluble and chromatin fractions were used for IP.  IP
samples were analyzed using western immunoblot with an anti-HA antibody to
detect Chd1-HA.  IgG IP serves as control.  b-tubulin western immunoblot
shows no signiﬁcant interaction with TDP-43. 
(C and D) Human HEK293 cells were fractionated to soluble and chromatin
fractions, and IP was performed with anti-TDP-43 antibodies (C), anti-CHD2
antibodies (D), or rabbit IgG as negative control.  Note the selective interactions

chromatin dynamics, largely downstream of the transcription
start site (TSS) within the transcribed gene body, and that these
impairments are restored by added Chd1. 
To conﬁrm these ﬁndings using an independent assay, we
used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of histone H3 in
adult ﬂies (Figure 4C), as the opening of chromatin structure is
accompanied by reduced occupancy of histone H3 [44].  In
accordance with the MNase data, heat shock resulted in loss
of the H3 signal, and clearance of H3 was impaired by TDP-43
(Figure 4D).  Here as well, Chd1-OE rescued TDP-43-mediated
impairments in nucleosomal clearance (Figure 4D).  To obtain a
quantitative measure of the dynamic ability of speciﬁc regions
within the Hsp70 locus to clear nucleosomes upon stress, we
calculated the ratio of non-heat shock to heat shock values for
both the MNase and H3 ChIP experiments (Figures S4C and
S4D).  This analysis further supported a role for TDP-43 in impairing chromatin dynamics.  We further conﬁrmed that TDP-43 did
not alter H3K4me3 levels at the Hsp70 promoter/TSS region,
underscoring that TDP-43 interferes with chromatin remodeling
but does not affect H3K4me3 levels (Figure S4B).  Moreover,
because TDP-43 impaired the induction of human HSP genes

in CHD2 are associated with neurological disorders, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and epileptic
encephalopathies [47–54], whereas loss of CHD1 in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to neural differentiation, suggesting that
CHD1 impairs neural fate [55].  Thus, we focused on CHD2 as the
relevant homolog in the brain. 
Using HEK293 cells, which endogenously express both TDP43 and CHD2, we determined whether TDP-43 and CHD2 physically interacted by coIP.  Cells were fractionated into soluble and
chromatin fractions, and anti-TDP-43 antibody was utilized for
IP.  CHD2 was selectively pulled down by TDP-43 (Figure 5C),
and, as in Drosophila, CHD2 and TDP-43 interacted primarily in
the soluble fraction, whereas TDP-43 was detected in both
fractions (Figure 5C).  IP with an IgG control as well as western
immunoblot against b-tubulin conﬁrmed the speciﬁcity of the
interaction.  We conﬁrmed a robust and selective interaction between TDP-43 and CHD2 by reverse IP with CHD2 and immunoblot against TDP-43 (Figure 5D).  Importantly, endogenous CHD2
and TDP-43 were coIPed without overexpression of these proteins, supporting a strong interaction.  To examine whether this
interaction was mediated by RNA, we repeated the IP with samples treated with RNase A.  Surprisingly, we detected an increase
3586 Current Biology 27, 3579–3590, December 4, 2017
in the association of CHD2 and TDP-43 (Figure S5D).  Mutations
in the TDP-43 RNA recognition motifs induce nuclear accumulations of TDP-43 [23, 56].  We therefore suggest that upon aggregation, TDP-43 increases its interaction with CHD2.  Of note,
however, RNase A treatment also promoted an interaction of
TDP-43 with b-tubulin, which is not bound under native conditions (Figure S5D).  Taken together, these data indicate that disruptions to the function of Chd1/CHD2 may be mediated by
interaction with TDP-43. 
Cytoplasmic TDP-43 Accumulations Are Associated
with Reduced CHD2 Levels in Cultured Cells and in
Human FTD Cortex
Given the interactions between TDP-43 and Chd1/CHD2, we
analyzed CHD2 expression using immunohistochemistry in
TetOn-GFP-TDP-43 and control cells (Figure 6A).  These data
showed that TetOn-GFP-TDP-43 cells had an 20% reduction
in CHD2 protein levels (Figure 6B).  Similar reduction was also detected by western immunoblot (Figure S5E).  We further noted
that 15% of cells expressing GFP-TDP-43 exhibited abnormal
accumulations of cytoplasmic TDP-43, reminiscent of ALS and
FTD (Figure 6C).  CHD2 levels were reduced in those cells with
cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulations (Figures 6C and 6D), suggesting that TDP-43 mislocalization is correlated with reduced
CHD2 levels. 
These results prompted us to examine CHD2 levels in the human brain.  CHD2 immunolabeling of temporal cortex showed
staining that appeared exclusively nuclear (Figure 6E), as in
cultured cells.  We then compared CHD2 immunolabeling between tissue from controls and FTD cases with TDP-43 pathology (FTD-TDP).  These data revealed that CHD2 levels were
dramatically reduced in FTD-TDP (Figures 6E and 6F).  Further,
when comparing CHD2 levels within FTD brain cells based on
nuclear or cytoplasmic TDP-43 localization, reduced CHD2
was associated with cells bearing abnormal cytoplasmic localization of TDP-43 (Figure 6G).  Therefore, in both cultured cells
and human post-mortem disease brain tissue, CHD2 protein
levels are negatively associated with abnormal cytoplasmic
TDP-43 accumulations.
