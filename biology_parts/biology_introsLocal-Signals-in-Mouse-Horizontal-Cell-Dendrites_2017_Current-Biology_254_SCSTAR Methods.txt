https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 10. 050The mouse retina contains a single type of horizontal
cell, a GABAergic interneuron that samples from all
cone photoreceptors within reach and modulates
their glutamatergic output via parallel
feedback
mechanisms.  Because horizontal cells form an electrically coupled network, they have been implicated
in global signal processing, such as large-scale
contrast enhancement.  Recently, it has been proposed that horizontal cells can also act locally at the
level of individual cone photoreceptors.  To test this
possibility physiologically, we used two-photon microscopy to record light stimulus-evoked Ca2+ signals
in cone axon terminals and horizontal cell dendrites as
well as glutamate release in the outer plexiform layer. 
By selectively stimulating the two mouse cone opsins
with green and UV light, we assessed whether signals
from individual cones remain isolated within horizontal cell dendritic tips or whether they spread across
the dendritic arbor.  Consistent with the mouse’s opsin
expression gradient, we found that the Ca2+ signals
recorded from dendrites of dorsal horizontal cells
were dominated by M-opsin and those of ventral
horizontal cells by S-opsin activation.  The signals
measured in neighboring horizontal cell dendritic
tips varied markedly in their chromatic preference,
arguing against global processing.  Rather, our experimental data and results from biophysically realistic
modeling support the idea that horizontal cells can
process cone input locally, extending the classical
view of horizontal cell function.  Pharmacologically
removing horizontal cells from the circuitry reduced
the sensitivity of the cone signal to low frequencies,
suggesting that local horizontal cell feedback shapes
the temporal properties of cone output. 
INTRODUCTION
Most neurons in the brain have elaborate dendritic arbors
capable of more than simply integrating synaptic input.  Studies
of neurons from different brain regions, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells [1], cortical pyramidal cells [2], hippocampal neurons
[3], and retinal amacrine cells [4, 5], have demonstrated that dendrites can be functionally highly compartmentalized.  Often,
multiple dendritic units can both process synaptic input and
generate synaptic output independently and at a local scale
(reviewed in [6]).  The cellular mechanisms supporting dendritic
processing include anatomical specializations, differential distribution of active channels, and the local restriction of intracellular
signaling (reviewed in [6]).  Moreover, computational work suggests that dendrites can even switch between local and global
signal processing [7].  Such functional compartmentalization of
dendritic arbors greatly increases the computational power of
single neurons and, therefore, that of the brain. 
In the retina, dendritic processing has been mainly studied in
ganglion cells [8, 9] and amacrine cells [4], where dendritic subunits vary dramatically in size and function.  For example, starburst amacrine cell dendritic arbors are divided in sections that
individually compute direction of visual motion [10, 11], while individual dendritic varicosities of A17 amacrine cells provide local
reciprocal feedback to individual rod bipolar cell terminals under
low-light conditions [4].  However, the outer retina also contains a
candidate for dendritic processing, the horizontal cell (HC).  This
is a GABAergic interneuron that provides reciprocal feedback
to photoreceptors and shapes their transmitter release [12–14]. 
The dendrites of HCs contact cone photoreceptors (cones),
whereas their axon terminal system contacts rod photoreceptors
(rods) [15]. 
Traditionally, HCs have been implicated in global processing,
such as contrast enhancement and the generation of antagonistic center-surround receptive ﬁelds (reviewed in [16]).  This is
consistent with the fact that HCs form a gap junction-coupled
network [17], which allows averaging signals across many
cones.  However, recent studies suggest that HCs support also
a local mode of operation and that HC feedback can act at the
level of a single synaptic contact between an HC dendritic tip
and a cone ([14, 18]; for discussion see [19]) (Figures 1A and 1B). 
Here, we test this idea by recording light stimulus-evoked signals at the HC-cone synapse in a slice preparation of the mouse
retina using two-photon Ca2+ [20, 21] and glutamate imaging
[22].  We exploited the particular retinal distribution of mouse
cone types to discriminate between global and local processing:
Mice express two types of cone opsins, a short (S, UV) and a
medium (M, green) wavelength-sensitive opsin.  So-called true
S-cones [23] exclusively express S-opsin and are homogenously

distributed across the retina, while M-cones co-express both
opsins at a ratio that changes from M- to S-opsin dominant along
the dorsoventral axis [24].  Thus, recording at different retinal
locations with different-wavelength stimuli makes it possible to
test if signals of neighboring cones mix in the postsynaptic HC
dendritic process.  We found that cone signals indeed remain
local in the contacting HC dendritic tips, suggesting that HCs
support a local mode of operation.

<Middle> RESULTS. 
Identiﬁcation of Cone Axon Terminals and HC Processes
in the Mouse Retinal Slice
We recorded Ca2+ signals in retinal slices prepared from transgenic mice (Cx57+/cre 3 Ai38; see the STAR Methods).  HC
processes could be identiﬁed in retinal slices by their GCaMP3
expression (Figure 1C).  To identify cone axon terminals, we
bath-applied SR101 [25], which is taken up from the extracellular
solution by the terminals of synaptically very active cells, such as
photoreceptors, during vesicle endocytosis [26].  We conﬁrmed
that the (larger) SR101-labeled structures in the outer plexiform
layer (OPL) were cone axon terminals with slices prepared
from HR2. 1:TN-XL mice [21], in which exclusively cones expressed TN-XL (Figure 1D). 
Light-Evoked Ca2+ Signals in HC Processes
To record light-evoked Ca2+ signals in HC dendritic segments,
we imaged ﬁelds in the OPL while presenting green, UV, or
white light ﬂashes (GUW protocol, STAR Methods) (Figures 1E
and 1F).  The resulting GCaMP3 ﬂuorescence image series was
averaged to anatomically deﬁned regions of interest (ROIs)
(STAR Methods).  We only considered ROIs that responded to
white ﬂashes and fulﬁlled two strict quality criteria, a quality index
(Qi) and a consistency index (Ci) (Figure S1; STAR Methods),
yielding 423 ROIs (4. 3% from a total of 9,912 ROIs) with reliable
light-evoked Ca2+ signals for further analysis (Figures S1B–S1D). 
Because the structural layout of the cone synapse is highly
stereotypical [27], we assumed that ROIs located close to the
cone axon terminal base are likely to be HC dendritic tips, since
this is where they make invaginating contacts with the cones
(reviewed in [19]).  ROIs well above the cone base are expected
to belong mostly to HC axon terminal tips (contacting rods),
whereas ROIs below the cone base should be located on HC primary dendrites [27].  To get an estimate of each ROI’s identity, we
manually determined the base of the cone terminals as a
landmark (solid lines in Figures 1A and 1C–1E) in each imaged
ﬁeld based on SR101 labeling.  We used the sharp transition
between the brightly stained cone axon terminals and the dimmer SR101 labeling below, which likely represented HC dendrites [26].  We estimated the distance (dbase) to the cone axon
terminal base for each ROI.  Responsive ROIs were most
frequent just above the cone axon terminal base (61. 5% ROIs
within 0 < dbase < 5 mm), within the OPL band occupied by
cone terminals.  Here, ROIs had the highest Qi values (Figure S1E)
and the largest light-evoked Ca2+ signals (Figure S1F), suggesting that we could indeed measure responses from HC dendritic
processes in or very close to the cone synapse. 
Mechanisms Underlying Light-Evoked Ca2+ ResponsesTo conﬁrm that the Ca2+ responses were mediated by glutamate
release from photoreceptors, we puff-applied the AMPA/KAtype glutamate receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3dione (NBQX; 200 mM) while presenting white ﬂashes (Figures
2A and 2B).  NBQX signiﬁcantly decreased the Ca2+ baseline
level (F0) in HC processes, and it virtually abolished light-evoked
Ca2+ signals, as indicated by a signiﬁcant reduction in response
amplitude (DF) and area under the curve (FArea) (Figures 2C–2E;
for statistics, see Table 1). 
Earlier experiments on isolated mouse HCs had shown that
intracellular Ca2+ is modulated by inﬂux through Ca2+-permeable
AMPA/KA receptors, L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
(VGCCs), and by release from internal Ca2+ stores [28].  To test
how these pathways contributed to the Ca2+ signals in HC
dendrites, we puff-applied a mixture of AMPA (50 mM) and KA
(25 mM) before and in the presence of blockers (Figure S2).  The
response amplitudes to AMPA/KA puffs alone decreased during
the experiment (Figures S2A and S2C), possibly caused by
downregulation of VGCCs and/or Ca2+ stores due to the strong
pharmacological stimulus.  We estimated this run-down from two
consecutive puffs by calculating the ratio of the response amplitudes (DF2/DF1).  When applying the L-type VGCC blocker verapamil (100 mM) 5 min before the second AMPA/KA puff, DF2/DF1
was signiﬁcantly reduced compared to control (Figures S2A,
S2B, and S2E; for statistics, see Table 1), conﬁrming that VGCCs
contributed to the signals. 
In separate experiments, we tested if
intracellular Ca2+
stores could be involved in amplifying Ca2+ signals in HC
processes.  We bath-applied the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum
inhibitor thapsigargin (5 mM), which
Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA)
blocks Ca2+ store reﬁll and leads to the depletion of Ca2+
stores [28], 20 min before the second AMPA/KA puff.  Thapsigargin decreased DF2/DF1 signiﬁcantly (Figures S2C, S2D, and S2F;
Table 1), suggesting that release from stores contributes to Ca2+
signals in HC dendrites. 
In summary, the observed light-evoked Ca2+ signals in HC
processes result from a combination of Ca2+ sources, in agreement with earlier ﬁndings [13, 28–31].  Moreover, they are modulated by GABA auto-reception (see Figure S3 and Table S1). 
Light-Evoked Ca2+ Signals in HCs Reﬂect the DorsalVentral Opsin Expression Gradient
Next, we recorded HC light-evoked Ca2+ responses at different
locations along the dorsoventral axis of the retina, using the
mouse opsin expression gradient as a tool to speciﬁcally activate
different combinations of S- and M-cones.  While the mouse
retina contains only 5% true S-cones [23], ontogenetic
M-cones in the ventral retina co-express large amounts of
S-opsin and, thus, are functional S-cones [24, 32].  Therefore, if
the spectral preference of the HC Ca2+ signals reﬂects this
gradient, this indicates that cones (and not rods) dominantly
drive these signals and that we are recording from HC dendrites. 
We determined the spectral contrast (SC; STAR Methods) of
each ROI as a function of its location along the dorsoventral
axis (Figure 3).  Consistent with the reported opsin gradient
[32], we found that dorsal HC responses were dominated by
M- and ventral HC responses by S-opsin activation (Figures 3A
and 3B).  ROIs located close to the cone axon terminal base

( 4 % dbase % 4 mm) had signiﬁcantly higher absolute SC
values (jSC-4. +4j = 0. 717 ± 0. 022; mean ± SEM; n = 342) than
ROIs below (dbase <  4 mm, jSC < 4j = 0. 417 ± 0. 045; n = 28;
p = 1. 611$10
(Figure 3C).  This
suggests that the HC distal tips reﬂect the contacted cone’s
chromatic preference and, thus, local signals.  More proximal
dendrites, on the other hand, average across cones, and, thus,
they show spatial integration, in agreement with the funnel shape
of the dbase versus SC plot (Figures 3A and 3B).  In the transitional
zone between dorsal and ventral retina halves, both a UV- and a
green-dominated ROI population co-exist (Figure 3D).  Opsin
immunostaining of slices from this zone conﬁrmed that the distribution of UV and green ROIs reﬂects cone opsin expression
(Figure 3E).  ROIs in the nasal part of the slice were UV sensitive,
and those in the temporal part were green sensitive, consistent
with the transitional zone running at a shallow angle relative to
the naso-temporal axis (Figure 3E, right scheme) [32].  Together,

our data indicate that the activity recorded in ROIs close to the
cone axon terminal base is mostly cone driven and likely reﬂects
activity in HC dendritic tips. 
Local Light-Evoked Ca2+ Signals in HC Dendritic Tips
Next, we assessed if signals from individual cones remain isolated within HC distal dendrites or if they spread across the cells’
dendritic arbors (or the electrically coupled HC network) (Figure 1B).  We looked for recording ﬁelds where neighboring
ROIs had different SC preferences (i. e. , contained ROIs with
SC > 0 and ROIs with SC < 0).  Indeed, this was the case for 15
of a total of 125 recording ﬁelds in both dorsal (5 ﬁelds; Figure 3F)
and ventral retina (10 ﬁelds; Figure 3G). 
To quantify this ﬁnding, we focused on purely UV and green
ROIs (jSCj > 0. 3; 7 ﬁelds, 22 ROIs), and we analyzed the distribution of the lateral distance between each UV ROI and its neighbors (Figure 3H).  We found that UV ROIs clustered in close
proximity (<10 mm) of each UV ROI, suggesting that they are
driven by the same cone, while the majority of green ROIs
3606 Current Biology 27, 3603–3615, December 4, 2017
clustered at larger distances (>10 mm).  The distribution of green
ROIs appeared to be periodic with the average distance approximating that between cone axon terminals (8 mm, cf.  Figures 1C
and 1D), indicating that these (green) ROIs were likely driven by
other cones. 
HC Dendritic Processes Inherit Properties of the
Presynaptic Cone
If HC dendritic tips reﬂect the local cone output, the measured
signals are expected to share properties with the cone signals
(see also Figure S4).  To test this, we presented a colored noise
stimulus (see the STAR Methods), and we measured correlations
between neighboring cone axon terminals and between neighboring HC dendritic tips in the dorsal retina (Figure 4).  If HCs
integrated signals globally, e. g. , by averaging across an HC’s
dendritic arbor or by electrical HC coupling, we would expect a
higher correlation between HC dendritic tips for the two stimulus
classes, due to the lateral signal spread, than for cone axon terminals.  The cone recordings were performed in HR2. 1:TN-XL

mice [21] in which cones expressed the Ca2+ biosensor TN-XL
(cf.  Figure 1D). 
We calculated the linear correlation coefﬁcient (r) between Ca2+
traces from cone ROIs (Figures 4A–4C) in the same recording
ﬁeld, in response to colored noise and to the GUW stimulus. 
Because the noise is a weaker stimulus compared to the GUW
ﬂashes, the correlation between cone terminal responses signiﬁcantly decreased for the noise (Table S2), both when only considering negative transients (Figure 4G) and when comparing whole
traces (Figure 4H).  We repeated this experiment on HCs in
Cx57+/cre 3 Ai38 mice (Figures 4D–4F), and, indeed, like for the
cones, the correlation between HC responses decreased for
colored noise compared to GUW stimulation (Table S2), for negative transients (Figure 4G) and whole traces (Figure 4H). 
A direct comparison between the two sets of experiments is
complicated by several factors that inﬂuence the estimation of
response correlation, including different scan rates for GUW
versus noise stimuli, different biosensors in cones versus HCs,
and different ROI sizes.  Nevertheless, our ﬁnding that noise
stimulation results in a similar (relative) decrease in correlation
for both the pre- (cone) and the postsynaptic (HC) signal
(see Dmedian in Table S2) argues in favor of relatively independent signals and possibly local processing in HC distal dendrites. 
This is further supported by the ﬁnding that nearby HC dendrites
possibly receiving input from the same cone show a higher degree of correlation (correlation between negative events versus
distance for noise: Spearman R =  0. 271, p = 2. 28$10Spearman rank correlation test; n = 1,125; Figure S5). 
We also used the Ca2+ responses to the noise stimulus to estimate the temporal receptive ﬁeld (time kernels, STAR Methods;
[33]).  In cone axon terminals (Figure 4I) and HC dendritic tips
(Figure 4J), the time kernels computed using negative Ca2+ transients (cf.  Figures 4C and 4F) displayed robust positive deﬂections.  Grouping cone ROIs by their spectral preference
(derived from their time kernels; STAR Methods) into green,
UV, and mixed revealed a fraction of 4% UV ROIs (Figure 4I),
closely matching the fraction of S-cones in the dorsal mouse
retina [23].  The averaged time kernels of the different groups
looked similar for cones and HCs (Figures 4I and 4J); cone kernels appeared to be slightly faster, likely due to differences in
biosensor properties (TN-XL: tdecay = 0. 2 s, KD in vitro =
2. 2 mM, from [34]; GCaMP3: tdecay = 0. 23 s, KD in vitro =
0. 66 mM, from [20, 35]).  HC kernels were noisier than those of
cones.  This may be related to differences in ROI area (cones:
9. 6 ± 0. 2 mm2, n = 457 ROIs; HCs: 1. 9 ± 0. 1 mm2, n = 344
ROIs) and, thus, different spatial averaging.  The fact that we
observed UV-selective kernels in HC dendritic tips just as in
cones adds further evidence to the notion that HC dendritic
tips show highly local Ca2+ signals (cf.  Figure 3). 
HC Morphology Supports Electrical Isolation of Distal
HC Dendrites
To test if the HC morphology supports electrically isolating at its
dendritic tips, we built a simple, biophysically realistic model of
a dendritic branch, including synapses with cones based on a
volume reconstruction from electron microscopy (EM) data (Figure 5; see the STAR Methods for details).  First, we stimulated a
single HC dendritic tip by injecting a current at the position of
its synaptic cone contact such that
the tip depolarized
to  25 mV.  We measured the resulting voltage and Ca2+ levels
in all other cone-contacting tips, and we found the membrane
voltage dropping rapidly with distance from the stimulated tip
(Figure 5B).  Only in directly neighboring tips (%15 mm distance),
the depolarization was sufﬁcient to activate VGCCs; however,
even then the resulting Ca2+ increase was two orders of magnitude smaller compared to the stimulated tip (Figure 5C).  We also
traced the voltage change from a stimulated tip to the soma (Figures 5D and 5E), showing that the tips were well isolated from the
rest of the HC’s dendritic arbor.  Finally, we tested if our model
could reproduce the light-evoked Ca2+ signals: We connected
a representative mixture of S- and M-cones to the HC, and we
presented full-ﬁeld light ﬂashes (Figure 5F).  The simulated
voltage responses resembled the Ca2+ signals we observed in
distal HC dendrites in terms of time course and spectral preference diversity (e. g. , Figure 3F).  Therefore, these modeling data
are in line with our experimental data, indicating that the HC
