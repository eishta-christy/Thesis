Beginning a new romantic relationship is often accompanied by a
barrage of emotional and physiological changes.  Individuals report
experiencing euphoria during the honeymoon period and exhibit differences in hormone and neurotransmitter levels (Marazziti, Akiskal,
Rossi, & Cassano, 1999; Marazziti & Canale, 2004), and brain activation
patterns (Aron Name, 2005).  Recent evidence points toward a link between autonomic reactivity and relationship formation, with new romantic relationships potentially buﬀering physiological reactivity to
negative emotions.  Speciﬁcally, diﬀerences in heart rate variability
(HRV) have been detected between single and newly-coupled individuals presented with emotional stimuli (Schneiderman, ZilbersteinKra, Leckman, & Feldman, 2011). 
HRV refers to the variation between successive heartbeat intervals
and is extracted through electrocardiography (ECG).  A variable heart
responds more readily to environmental cues and returns to baseline
more quickly.  The high frequency (HF) component of HRV (. 15–. 40 Hz)
primarily represents the inﬂuence of the parasympathetic nervous
system (Thayer, Åhs, Fredrikson, Sollers, & Wager, 2012) which is associated with vegetative and restorative functions.  Resting HRV refers
to a single measurement taken while the individual is at rest, whereas
HRV reactivity measures phasic changes in HRV in response to a
stressor. 
According to Porges’ (1995; 1998) polyvagal theory, the myelinated
branch of the vagus nerve exerts parasympathetic inﬂuence on the
heart and controls the social engagement system.  This social engagement system serves as the neurophysiological basis for courting behaviours associated with seduction and the control of facial expression,
vocalization, and head tilt.  This system communicates reproductive
availability and fosters proximity with potential romantic partners
(Porges, 1998).
