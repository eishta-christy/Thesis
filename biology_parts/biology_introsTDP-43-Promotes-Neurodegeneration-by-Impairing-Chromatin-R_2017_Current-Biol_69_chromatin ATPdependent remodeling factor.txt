In Brief
Berson Name show that TDP-43, a protein
associated with ALS and FTD, impairs the
stress response by interfering with the
chromatin remodeling protein Chd1 in
ﬂies and CHD2 in mammalian cells.  In
turn, animals expressing TDP-43 are
hypersensitive to various types of
stressors, indicating that this impairment
may promote neurodegeneration. 
Highlights
d TDP-43 cripples the stress response
d TDP-43 impairs nucleosomal dynamics and the induction of
heat shock genes
d TDP-43 physically interacts with ﬂy Chd1 and human CHD2
d Reduced levels of human CHD2 protein are observed in
frontotemporal dementia

https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 10. 024Regulation of chromatin structure is critical for brain
development and function.  However, the involvement of chromatin dynamics in neurodegeneration
is less well understood.  Here we ﬁnd, launching
from Drosophila models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, that TDP-43 impairs the induction of multiple key stress genes
required to protect from disease by reducing the
recruitment of the chromatin remodeler Chd1 to
chromatin.  Chd1 depletion robustly enhances TDP43-mediated neurodegeneration and promotes the
formation of stress granules.  Conversely, upregulation of Chd1 restores nucleosomal dynamics,
promotes normal
induction of protective stress
genes, and rescues stress sensitivity of TDP-43-expressing animals.  TDP-43-mediated impairments
are conserved in mammalian cells, and, importantly,
the human ortholog CHD2 physically interacts with
TDP-43 and is strikingly reduced in level in temporal
cortex of human patient
tissue.  These ﬁndings
indicate that TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration
causes impaired chromatin dynamics that prevents
appropriate expression of protective genes through
compromised function of the chromatin remodeler
Chd1/CHD2.  Enhancing chromatin dynamics may
be a treatment approach to amyotrophic lateral
scleorosis (ALS)/frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 
INTRODUCTION
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable, relentlessly
progressing neurodegenerative disease, leading to death within
3–5 years of diagnosis in most cases [1, 2].  In ALS, the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons leads to muscle atrophy,
weakness, and eventually paralysis.  Although predominantly a
motor disorder, 20% of ALS cases also develop cognitive deficits that resemble those seen in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 
Strikingly, ALS and select FTD subtypes share the pathological
hallmark of ubiquitinated inclusions composed of TDP-43 protein, encoded by the TARDBP gene [3]. 
The discovery of TARDBP mutations in ALS and FTD [4, 5]
demonstrates that TDP-43 plays causal roles in the pathogenesis of these diseases.  Therefore, understanding the molecular
events underlying TDP-43 toxicity is of special
importance. 
Indeed, abnormal TDP-43 levels and localization are toxic to
neurons [6], elicit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [7], and
impair multiple cellular processes, including axonal transport
[8], mitochondrial function [9], and RNA metabolism [10].  TDP43 is a ubiquitously expressed RNA- and DNA-binding protein,
with primarily nuclear localization.  Interestingly, TDP-43 was
originally identiﬁed as a transcriptional
[11], but
DNA-related functions of TDP-43 remain largely unexplored. 
repressor
Proper chromatin regulation is critical for gene expression in
the brain [12, 13], and various epigenetic mechanisms including
DNA methylation [14], histone acetylation [15], and histone
variant exchange [16] have been shown to control memory formation and consolidation.  Recent observations also point to
possible altered histone methylation and acetylation having a
role during brain degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease [17] and
in models of tauopathies [18].  Chromatin remodeling is carried
out by a large family of ATP-dependent enzymes that modify
chromatin structure by depositing, sliding, and evicting histones
[19].  Mutations in multiple chromatin remodelers are associated
with human mental disorders, suggesting that imbalance of
neuronal chromatin structure and the ensuing alterations in
gene expression are detrimental to brain function [20].  The
CHD family of chromatin remodelers is characterized by tandem
chromodomains in the N-terminal region and a central catalytic
domain with homology to the canonical SNF2-like ATPase
domain.  Vertebrates contain CHD1 and CHD2, which form a
unique subfamily due to the presence of a C-terminal DNA-binding domain [21], whereas in invertebrates only one gene, Chd1,Here we took an unbiased screening approach to askwhether chromatin regulatory proteins might be critical

neurodegeneration.  We ﬁnd an unexpected role of TDP-43 in impairing Chd1-dependent chromatin dynamics at stress genes,
thus reducing the protective stress response and promoting
neurodegeneration.  We also ﬁnd a striking loss of CHD2 in human FTD cortex, indicating that impaired chromatin remodeling
may be a key event in ALS/FTD.

TDP-43 Toxicity Is Modulated by H3K4me3-Related
Genes in Drosophila
We performed an in vivo RNAi screen in which we reduced
expression of 84 genes related to various aspects of chromatin
regulation in a Drosophila model of ALS/FTD (Table S1; genes
were selected as in [22]).  The gene set included histone methyltransferases, demethylases, acetyltransferases (HATs), and deacetylases (HDACs), as well as associated factors, histones, and
chromatin remodelers.  We expressed TDP-43 in the ﬂy eye with
the binary GAL4/UAS expression system.  Such ﬂies show progressive retinal deterioration that can be visualized externally,
providing a simple and rapid readout of TDP-43 toxicity and
potential gene enhancers or suppressors [23].  We followed the
screen with secondary tests using a model of TDP-43-mediated
brain degeneration. 
Following exclusion of RNAi lines that affected eye integrity on
their own, the screen uncovered 31 modiﬁers, 4 of which we
classiﬁed as ‘‘strong’’ and 27 as ‘‘mild’’ based on eye structure
(Figure 1A).  The modiﬁers, both enhancers and suppressors of
TDP-43 toxicity, included a range of genes from most of the
tested functional categories.  However, we noted that six modiﬁers were related to histone H3 trimethyl lysine 4 (H3K4me3; Figure 1A), a mark associated with active gene expression [24].  Two
strong modiﬁers were lid and Chd1 (Figures 1B and 1C): knockdown of lid, an H3K4me3 demethylase [25], strongly suppressed
TDP-43 toxicity, whereas knockdown of Chd1, a chromatin ATPdependent remodeling factor associated with H3K4me3 [26],
enhanced TDP-43 toxicity (Figures 1B and 1C).  Knockdown of
three components of COMPASS (conserved multiprotein complexes that mediate methylation of H3K4 [27]) showed mild
enhancement of TDP-43 toxicity.
