THC and other components in marijuana are among the most
commonly used illicit drugs in the world.  A recent report [1] indicates
over 181 million users world-wide, while an estimated 13. 1 million
people exhibit cannabis dependence globally [2].  Marijuana usage is
increasing in many countries, [3] and chronic use appears to be a risk
factor for several mental illnesses including psychosis [4] and depression [5].  Moreover, chronic use is also linked to reduced performance
on decision-making tasks [6,7].  It is therefore important to better understand how THC aﬀects the neural processes involved in cognition
and decision-making.  Previous studies have indicated deﬁcits in executive function, verbal and visual memory, and visuoperception following chronic cannabis use in humans [8].  Rodent models have likewise shown impairments in working memory [9,10] and spatial
memory [11] following acute THC administration.  Furthermore, acute
THC causes impairments in reversal learning in macaques [12], as well
as reversal learning and intradimensional set shifting impairments in
rats [13,14].  These ﬁndings have led to the proposal that THC impairs
cognitive ﬂexibility.  This is a nebulous term; for the purpose of this
paper we deﬁne cognitive ﬂexibility as the ability to change response
strategies when it is advantageous to do so.  Cognitive ﬂexibility is inﬂuenced by distinct neural processes that may compete or cooperate to
modulate behaviour [15].  For example, animals can learn to select
options based on action value estimates acrued over many trials (reinforcement learning), or could instead use heuristics to guide choice
[16].  Animals may also rely on innate strategies such as the propensity
to switch choices after reward omission, a widespread phenomenon
termed lose-shift responding [17–20].
