Working on a daily basis with patients in pain can be a trying experience for healthcare providers (HCPs).  Indeed, witnessing others in
pain can elicit a self-focused aversive reaction called personal distress
(Batson, 1987; Eisenberg & Eggum, 2009; Eisenberg & Fabes, 1990). 
This negative response to the suﬀering of others often motivates behavioral responses aimed at rapidly diminishing one’s own discomfort
instead of oﬀering help to alleviate the other person’s suﬀering (Batson,
1991; Cialdini Name, 1987; Tice, Bratslavsky & Baumeister, 2001). 
Successful regulation of personal distress is therefore necessary to feel
concern for others and oﬀer optimal help to persons(Eisenberg & Eggum, 2009; Eisenberg & Fabes, 1990).
