The human startle response is a reﬂexive contraction of the skeletal
and facial muscles in response to a sudden, intense stimulus and is regarded as a defensive rather than an orienting response (Braﬀ, 2010). 
The strength of the human eye blink reﬂex is assessed as a subcomponent of the whole body startle reﬂex using electromyography
(EMG) of the orbicularis oculi muscles.
