In Brief
Berson Name show that TDP-43, a protein
associated with ALS and FTD, impairs the
stress response by interfering with the
chromatin remodeling protein Chd1 in
ï¬‚ies and CHD2 in mammalian cells.  In
turn, animals expressing TDP-43 are
hypersensitive to various types of
stressors, indicating that this impairment
may promote neurodegeneration.
