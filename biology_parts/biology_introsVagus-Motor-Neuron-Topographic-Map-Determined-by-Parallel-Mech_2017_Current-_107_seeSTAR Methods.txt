https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 11. 022Many networks throughout the nervous system are
organized into topographic maps, where the positions
of neuron cell bodies in the projecting ﬁeld correspond
with the positions of their axons in the target ﬁeld.  Previous studies of topographic map development show
evidence for spatial patterning mechanisms, in which
molecular determinants expressed across the projecting and target ﬁelds are matched directly in a point-topoint mapping process.  Here, we describe a novel
temporal mechanism of topographic map formation
that depends on spatially regulated differences in the
timing of axon outgrowth and functions in parallel
with spatial point-to-point mapping mechanisms.  We
focus on the vagus motor neurons, which are topographically arranged in both mammals and ﬁsh.  We
show that cell position along the anterior-posterior
axis of hindbrain rhombomere 8 determines expression of hox5 genes, which are expressed in posterior,
but not anterior, vagus motor neurons.  Using live imaging and transplantation in zebraﬁsh embryos, we
additionally reveal that axon initiation is delayed in
posterior vagus motor neurons independent of neuron
birth time.  We show that hox5 expression directs
topographic mapping without affecting time of axon
outgrowth and that time of axon outgrowth directs
topographic mapping without affecting hox5 expression.  The vagus motor neuron topographic map is
therefore determined by two mechanisms that act in
parallel: a hox5-dependent spatial mechanism akin
to classic mechanisms of topographic map formation
and a novel axon outgrowth-dependent temporal
mechanism in which time of axon formation is spatially
regulated to direct axon targeting. 
INTRODUCTION
Topographic maps are a common organizational motif in neurobiology and are crucial for the ability of animals to accurately
perceive and respond to their external environment.  These
maps are characterized by an arrangement of neurons in which
neighbor-neighbor relationships are preserved between cell
bodies and axon targets, creating representations of the outside
world inside the brain [1].  The best-studied topographic maps
form through a spatial patterning process, where precise patterns of gene expression in neurons and their target areas direct
axons to the proper location in a point-to-point matching system
[2, 3].  For example, in the retinotopic map, gradients of EphA receptor expression in the retina and EphrinA ligand expression in
the tectum are matched such that high and low EphA-expressing
neurons innervate opposite regions of the tectum while neighbor
neurons expressing similar EphA levels innervate the same
region [4–9].  Similarly, in the spinal musculotopic map, dorsal
and ventral limb-innervating neurons occupy spatially distinct locations and reach their respective targets due to the presence of
repulsive ligands expressed by the inappropriate targets [10–14]. 
Thus, spatial patterning mechanisms underlie topographic map
development in both sensory and motor systems. 
In addition to classic spatial patterning, previous studies have
also proposed a temporal mechanism of topographic map
development.  In the Drosophila photoreceptor map, sequential
expression of a temporal identity transcription factor during neurogenesis directs targeting to different layers of the medulla [15]. 
Additionally, in the mouse olfactory topographic map, cell position correlates with birth order and therefore with time of axonin the target region [16, 17].  However, though these
studies demonstrate correlations between temporal patterning
and topographic connectivity, timing-based mechanisms for
topographic map formation have been difﬁcult to explicitly test,
as they require live imaging and the ability to manipulate the temporal environment. 
Here, to dissect the relative contributions of both spatial and
temporal mechanisms of topographic map development, we
focus on vagus motor neurons (motor neurons of cranial
nerve X, or mX neurons) in the zebraﬁsh embryo as a model of
topographic map development.  In all vertebrates, mX neurons
are located in the most posterior segment of the hindbrain, rhombomere 8 (r8) [18].  In humans, mX neurons innervate pharyngealarch-derived muscles important for speech and swallowing. 
In ﬁsh, mX neurons innervate homologous muscles to move
the pharynx, gills, and pharyngeal
In both ﬁsh and
humans, the vagus also supplies preganglionic parasympathetic3812 Current Biology 27, 3812–3825, December 18, 2017 ª 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

innervation of visceral targets [19, 20].  Previous studies in ﬁsh
and mammals have shown that mX neurons in the adult animal
are arranged topographically, with anterior neurons innervating
more anterior pharyngeal arches and posterior neurons innervating posterior pharyngeal arches and visceral[21, 22].  However, it is unclear how the vagus topographic map
is established during development. 
We describe two parallel and independent mechanisms for
vagus topographic map development.  First, we show that
hox5 genes are expressed in posterior mX neurons and direct
mX neuron targeting toward posterior targets.  Second, we
demonstrate that temporal regulation of axon initiation inﬂuences axon targeting.  Whereas anterior and posterior mX neurons are born at the same time, axons emerge from posterior
mX neurons later than from anterior mX neurons and late
axon arrival in the peripheral target area directs axons to posterior targets.  Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms are independent.  This work therefore establishes a new
temporal mechanism that acts in parallel with hox-dependent
spatial patterning mechanisms to govern the robust development of a topographic map.

Characterization of Embryonic Vagus Motor Neuron
Topographic Map
Vagus (mX) neurons, detectable with isl1-driven ﬂuorescent proteins [23], are born ventrally in hindbrain r8 and migrate dorsolaterally to form the vagus motor nucleus by 36 hr post-fertilization
(hpf) [24].  Axons emerge basally, ﬁrst exiting the hindbrain at
27 hpf, and travel anteriorly in a single fascicle before making
a characteristic ventral turn at the otic vesicle toward the pharyngeal arches (PAs) (Figure 1A) [25].  The axons divide peripherally
into 5 branches, which are all present by 3 days post-fertilization
(dpf): 4 branches innervate PA4, 5, 6, and 7 and a 5th posterior
branch innervates visceral targets (Figure 1A) [23].  In time-lapse
movies, the axon branches appear sequentially in anterior-toposterior order, with the PA4 branch emerging ﬁrst and the
PA7 and visceral branches emerging last (Figure 1B; Movie S1). 
To simultaneously visualize the appearance of mX axons
and their PA targets, we time-lapsed embryos expressing
Tg(isl1:eGFPCAAX) and Tg(tcf21:mCherry), which marks the
progenitors of the PA muscles that are the targets of branchiomotor innervation [26, 27].  Tcf21:mCherry+ cells appear in an
anterior-to-posterior sequence, with each PA emerging about
6–8 hr before mX axon innervation (Figure 1C; Movie S2).  Thus,
the sequential outgrowth of mX branches correlates with the
sequential appearance of their PA targets. 
To understand how the mX neuron topographic map is established, we ﬁrst determined whether it is detectable in the zebraﬁsh embryo.  We injected single-cell-stage embryos expressing
Tg(isl1:mRFP) with isl1:eGFPCAAX, titrated to a low level such
that only a single mX neuron was labeled with eGFPCAAX.  We
divided the mX territory into 10 equal-length bins and determined
the axon target of each single mX neuron based upon its relative
position in the mX territory (Figures 1D–1H).  We note that single
mX neurons only ever project into a single PA (n = 57/57).  We
found that mX neurons in bin 1 exclusively innervated PA4 and
PA5, whereas mX neurons in bins 4–10 exclusively innervate
PA7 and the viscera (Figure 1I).  We conﬁrmed this single-cell
mapping approach with photoconversion experiments using
Tg(isl1:Kaede), photoconverting deﬁned regions of the mX territory and subsequently visualizing the photoconverted Kaede in
the peripheral branches (anterograde labeling), and conversely
photoconverting speciﬁc branches and subsequently visualizing
the photoconverted Kaede in cell bodies (retrograde labeling;
Figure S1).  Whereas we observed overlap between mX neurons
innervating neighboring PAs, our single-neuron and photoconversion mapping approaches consistently describe a vagus
topographic map at 3 dpf that is sufﬁciently resolved to allow
us to investigate its developmental basis. 
Vagus Motor Neuron Position Determines Axon Target
We ﬁrst asked whether the position of an mX neuron in r8 determines its axon target.  To address this question, we used singleneuron transplantation to manipulate the spatial environment of
individual postmitotic neurons [28].  At 27 hpf, when postmitotic
mX neurons are present along the anterior-posterior axis of r8
but before they have extended axons, we transplanted postmitotic mX neurons from a Tg(isl1:Kaede) donor to the same
(homotopic) or different (heterotopic) position in r8 of a Tg(isl1:
GFP) host embryo.  To ensure accurate developmental age, we
used the precise ‘‘prim staging’’ method to stage all embryos
at the time of transplantation [29] (see STAR Methods for details). 
We transplanted 1–5 mX neurons (median = 2) into each host
embryo and then assessed targeting of the donor neuron(s)
at 3 dpf (Figure 2A).  Singly transplanted neurons only projected
into a single PA, similar to our earlier single-cell labeling experiments (n = 8/8 embryos; e. g. , Figures 2B and 2E).  As expected,
in control anterior / anterior homotopic transplants, donor neurons innervated primarily anterior targets (Figures 2B and 2F),
and in control posterior / posterior homotopic transplants,
donor neurons innervated primarily posterior targets (Figures
2D and 2F).  In heterotopic anterior / posterior transplants,
donor neurons innervated primarily posterior targets (Figures
in heterotopic posterior / anterior
2C and 2F).  Likewise,
