In Brief
Sood and Brickner ﬁnd that faster GAL
gene induction during transcriptional
memory accelerates adaptation to
galactose and requires both previously
produced Gal1 to relieve Gal80
repression and the Gal4 central domain,
which potentiates stronger activation. 
Related yeasts use either genetic or
epigenetic means to alter GAL gene
activation rates.

https://doi. org/10. 1016/j. cub. 2017. 10. 035Certain genes show more rapid reactivation for
several generations following repression, a conserved
phenomenon called epigenetic transcriptional memory.  Following previous growth in galactose, GAL
gene transcriptional memory confers a strong ﬁtness
beneﬁt in Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapting to
growth in galactose for up to 8 generations.  A genetic
screen for mutants defective for GAL gene memory revealed new insights into the molecular mechanism,
adaptive consequences, and evolutionary history of
memory.  A point mutation in the Gal1 co-activator
that disrupts the interaction with the Gal80 inhibitor
speciﬁcally and completely disrupted memory.
