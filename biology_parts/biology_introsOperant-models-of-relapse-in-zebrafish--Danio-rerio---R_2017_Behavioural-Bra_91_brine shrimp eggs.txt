Operant behavior results from the relations between behavior and
its consequences and has been used extensively as a model of voluntary
behavior [1,2].  The systematic analysis of environmental and biological
factors underlying operant behavior provides understanding and potential treatments for a range of behaviors considered maladaptive,
such as addictions [3] and overeating [4].  Most research examining
biological and environmental factors in learning processes come from
studies with mammalian laboratory animals.  As an alternative, zebraﬁsh (Danio rerio) are ideal for examining environmental and biological
factors involved in learning because of their high fecundity, low-cost
maintenance,
transparent embryo, and fully sequenced genome
[e. g. ,5–8].  Key neurobiological structures mediating the reinforcing
eﬀects of
(e. g. , drugs) appear conserved in zebraﬁsh
[e. g. ,9,10].  Moreover, many diﬀerent types of genetically modiﬁedzebraﬁsh are available (e. g. , National BioResource Project in Japan). 
These features oﬀer biomedical and behavioral researchers opportunities to examine how genes and environment interact to determine
operant behavior.  Nevertheless, studies of operant behavior with zebraﬁsh remain few [11–13]. 
One area of research relevant to understanding operant behavior
generally, and treatments for maladaptive behavior speciﬁcally, is with
laboratory models of relapse.  A persistent tendency to relapse even after
prolonged periods of abstinence is a deﬁning feature of addictive behavior [14].  Therefore, relapse of previously learned behavior has been
investigated extensively during the past few decades [15–18].  Most
models of relapse arrange reinforcement of operant responding in Phase
1 to simulate engaging in maladaptive behavior and then, in Phase 2,
model a basic form of behavioral treatment by eliminating those reinforcers through extinction of operant responding.  Models of relapse
primarily diﬀer in Phase 3 as a result of arranging diﬀerent factors

contributing to the relapse.  The relapse of previously reinforced and
extinguished responding in these models indicates that decreases in
operant responding during extinction do not represent an elimination of
prior learning.  Instead, relapse indicates new learning involving the
extinction contingency [see 15]. 
Relapse of operant behavior has been demonstrated with a wide
variety of species in the three laboratory models of relapse serving as
the focus in this investigation (see Table 1).  First, resurgence is the relapse
of a previously reinforced and then extinguished response when
reducing or eliminating reinforcement for a more recently trained response
[e. g. ,19–22].  Hereafter, the response reinforced and then extinguished
will be referred to as the target response and the more recently
trained response as the alternative response.  Resurgence has been
demonstrated with rats [e. g. ,20,23], pigeons [e. g. ,24,25], Siamese
fighting fish [26], monkeys [27], and humans [e. g. ,28].  Recently, our
laboratory demonstrated resurgence with zebrafish for the first timeSecond, renewal is relapse due to changes in environmental context. 
Specifically, renewal is the return of a target response when changing
the global environmental context compared to the extinction context
[e. g. ,30,31,32].  Renewal occurs, for example, when reinforcing and
extinguishing the target response in different contexts and then (1)
returning to the training context (ABA renewal) or (2) transitioning to a
novel context (e. g. , ABC renewal).  Renewal of operant behavior has
been demonstrated with rats [30,33], pigeons [e. g. ,34,35], and humans
[36] but not yet with zebrafish. 
Finally, reinstatement is relapse resulting from exposure to a range of
events due to learning (e. g. , cues) or biological relevance (e. g. , stress)
[37].  One commonly used method for assessing reinstatement of an
extinguished target response is to present the event previously serving
as the reinforcer independently of responding [38,39].  Reinstatement
has been demonstrated with rats [e. g. ,40], pigeons [e. g. ,41,42], monkeys
[43,44], and humans [e. g. ,45,46].  Thus far, there have been no
demonstrations of reinstatement of operant behavior in zebrafish −
only reinstatement of a Pavlovian conditioned approach response to
drug (cocaine or nicotine) [10]. 
All these studies suggest relapse of previously reinforced and then
extinguished operant behavior is general across species.  These three
procedures serve as experimental models for understanding the conditions
under which relapse occurs and might be used as platforms to
examine biological influences in relapse, including developmental,
pharmacological, and neurobiological factors [16].  Nevertheless, research
on laboratory models of relapse using zebrafish has been limited. 
Therefore, the goals of the present study were to systematically replicate
resurgence and to extend the analysis to renewal, and reinstatement
of extinguished operant behavior in zebrafish using an
automated device to record discrete responses (i. e. , approaching sensors)
and deliver decapsulated brine shrimp eggs as reinforcers [11,12].
