The US Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Canadian Species at Risk
Act (SARA) mandate that recovery strategies be developed for endangered and threatened species.  Of the 1872 species or populations listed
under the ESA or SARA, two thirds (1393) have formal recovery plans
(Fig.  1).  Despite this large-scale effort, relatively few listed species
have been sufﬁciently recovered as to be removed or down-listed
from either the ESA or SARA.  Of the 61 species delisted from the ESA,
only half (32 species) have been delisted because they have met recovery goals, 10 species have been removed due to extinction, and the remainder as a result of updated information (e. g.  taxonomic revisions)
(https. //ecos. fws. gov/tess_public/reports/delisting-report accessed 7
December, 2015), while only 3 species under SARA have been delisted
because they were recovered (Favaro N, 2014).  The challenge of recovering species often stems from uncertainty in the causes of decline,
mitigating or circumventing the drivers of decline, and having sufﬁcient
resources to meaningfully address these problems at the often large
spatial and temporal scales required for species recovery. 
Recovery decisions for endangered species are often made quickly
and with limited data with which to inform recovery objectives
(Martin N, 2012.  Gerber and Hatch 2002).  However, reviews of
ESA recovery plans found that plans with a higher number of clear
quantitative recovery goals (i. e.  target population sizes and number of
populations) are associated with improving species status (Gerber and
Hatch 2002.  Himes Boor, 2014), suggesting that leveraging even limited
data in a quantitative framework to inform species recovery is useful.
