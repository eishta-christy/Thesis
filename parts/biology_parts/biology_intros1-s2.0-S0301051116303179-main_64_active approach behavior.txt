1.  Introduction.  Augmenting/reducing (A/R) is assumed to reﬂect individual differences in the modulation of sensory input, and has usually been studied using amplitude measures of event-related potentials (ERP) elicited at different levels of stimulus intensity (e. g. , Buchsbaum & Silverman, 1968).  A pronounced increase in amplitudes of the auditory N1/P2 component, as a function of stimulus intensity, is thought to reﬂect sensory inhibition at high levels of stimulations (e. g. , Zuckerman, 1994) produced by serotonergic neurotransmission (Hegerl & Juckel, 1993).  This mechanism is essential for the ﬁltering properties of a gating mechanism that regulates sensory input to the cerebral cortex (Buchsbaum, Goodwin, Murphy, & Borge, 1971.  Buchsbaum & Silverman, 1968).  Individuals are classiﬁed as augmenters or reducers depending on whether they show a strong increase or weak increase or decrease on ERP amplitudes with increasing of stimulus intensity.  Beauducel, Debener, Brocke, and Kayser (2000) found that the N1/P2-slope calculated across 5–6 auditory intensity levels, spanning a wide intensity range, are required for a reliable assessment of auditory A/R.  The amplitude-intensity function slope (AIF), deﬁned as the slopes of the linear regression line for the individual P1/N1 and N1/P2 amplitudes across the 5–6 stimulus intensities (Brocke, Beauducel, John, Debener, & Heilemann, 2000.  Brocke, Beauducel, Tasche, 1999.  Hegerl, Gallinat, & Mrowinski, 1994.  Hegerl, Prochno, Ulrich, & Müller-Oerlinghausen, 1989) has been used as index of individual modes of processing sensory input (e. g. , Hegerl & Juckel, 1993).  A rich collection of ﬁndings have been reported by Buchsbaum, Haier, and Johnson (1983) and (Hensch, Herold, Diers, Armbruster, & Brocke, 2008) of psychiatric and psychological phenomena associated with augmenting-reducing.  In addition, reserch has demonstrated that the N1/P2 AIF of the ERPs is one of the numerous endophenotypes that are gaining importance in psychiatry and genetic research (e. g. , Brocke et al. , 2006.  Gottesman & Gould, 2003).  The N1/P2 AIF is considered important for clinical practice as it has been good to predict responses to lithium and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors treatments (Gallinat et al. , 2000.  Juckel et al. , 2004.  Mulert et al. , 2007.  Tien-Wen, Younger, Chen, & Tsai, 2005).  The N1/P2 AIF has been proved to be associated with 5-HTTLPR, a genetic polymorphism of the serotonin transporter coding gene (Gallinat et al. , 2003.  Hensch et al. , 2006.  Strobel et al. , 2003), and thus heritable (Sándor, Áfra, Proietti-Cecchini, Albert, & Schoenen, 1999).  In terms of personality traits, it was found that individuals scoring high on sensation seeking facets, and mainly on its disinhibition subscale, were augmenters and reducers tend to be sensation avoiding (Brocke et al. , 2000.  Brocke et al. , 1999.  Lukas, 1987.  Stenberg, Rosén, & Risberg, 1988.  von Knorring, 1980.  Zuckerman, 1990.  Zuckerman, 1994.  Zuckerman, Murtaugh, & Siegel, 1974.  Zuckerman, Simons, & Como, 1988).  Moreover, Eysenck’s extraversion trait was found positively associated with augmenting (Friedman & Meares, 1979.  Soskis & Shagass, 1974.  Stenberg et al. , 1988).  The validity of these ﬁndings was further supported by linking sensation avoiding and introversion with the defensive reducing pattern.  The N1/P2 AIF was found correlated with a risk factor for bipolar disorder in healthy individuals (Hensch, Herold, & Brocke, 2007), and with sensation seeking trait, which is suggested to be characterized by low serotonergic neurotransmission and a potential risk factor for mental disorders (Brocke et al. , 1999.  Hegerl, Gallinat, & Mrowinski, 1995).  In contrast, individuals with strong sensation-seeking tendencies are believed to be characterized by high dopaminergic, low noradrenergic, and low serotonergic activity (for a review see Zuckerman, 1994).  Augmenting has been also related to impulsivity (Barratt, Pritchard, Faulk, & Brandt, 1987.  Carrillo-De-La-Pena & Barratt, 1993).  Considering that impulsivity is an important trait of the reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) of personality, it is surprising that no or little research has been done to evaluate the relation between RST traits and A/R of the ERPs.  The most recent version of the RST (Corr & McNaughton, 2012.  McNaughton & Corr, 2004, 2008.  McNaughton & Gray, 2000) postulates three major neuropsychological systems controlling approach and avoidance behavior.  (1) the Behavioral Approach System (BAS) controls active approach behavior in response to signals of reward and non-punishment and is activated by all forms of appetitive stimuli (including relief of nonpunishment).  (2) the Fight-Flight-Freeze system (FFFS) as a primary system that controls active avoidance and is activated by all forms of aversive stimuli (including frustrating nonreward).
