INTRODUCTION. 
The acquisition and processing of nouns and verbs, two word categories that
differ both syntactically (i. e. , for their grammatical role) and conceptually
(denoting different entities.  objects and actions), has received much
attention recently.  There is empirical evidence that verbs and nouns are
two cognitively distinct word categories, involving different kinds of
representations and processing demands.  Studies of children’s early lexical
development have shown evidence of a gap in the acquisition of nouns and
verbs, with nouns being acquired earlier than verbs in some languages
(English, French, German, and Italian.  Bassano, .  Bates et al. , . 
Gentner, .  Gentner & Boroditsky, .  MacNamara, .  Nelson,
), and the opposite pattern being true in others (Mandarin Chinese
and Korean.  Choi & Gopnick, .  Tardif, ), suggesting that
children’s processing of nouns and verbs entails different cognitive
demands.  The present study adds to this line of research by exploring the
lexical and conceptual/semantic variables contributing to object and action
naming skills in three- and five-year-old Italian children. 
There is extensive evidence that the vocabulary of very young children
speaking English, German, and Italian includes mainly nouns, with verbs
present in a more restricted number (Bassano, .
