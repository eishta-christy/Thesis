 When speakers talk, they are normally trying to give linguistic form to a notion they have in their heads that they wish to implant in their interlocutors’ heads.  Insofar as speakers can and do describe things that they are seeing either at that very moment or with their minds’ eyes, it is logical to think that visual characteristics will have an inﬂuence on speaker choices regarding most obviously the content, but also the ﬁnal form of their descriptive utterances.  Vision has been found to inﬂuence language in many ways.  For example, a character who is looked at ﬁrst for perceptual reasons is more likely to be mentioned ﬁrst (e. g. , Gleitman, January, Nappa, & Trueswell, 2007.  Myachykov, Garrod, & Scheepers, 2012.  Myachykov, Thompson, Garrod, & Scheepers, 2011).  looks to characters in an image have been consistently found to predict mention of the ﬁxated characters (e. g. , Coco & Keller, 2012.  Coco, Malcolm, & Keller, 2014.  Grifﬁn, 2001) and their properties (Haskell, 2005.  Meyer, van der Meulen, & Brooks, 2004.  van der Meulen, 2001).  and visual content inﬂuences choice of referring expression (Fukumura, van Gompel, & Pickering, 2010).  However, speakers are not always describing a scene, and even when they are, some of the information conveyed is not straightfordwardly attributable to something the speakers perceive or have a perceptual memory of.
