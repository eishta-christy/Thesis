I N T R O D U C T I O N.  From an early age, children produce oral stories, and by the time children enter elementary school, they also start to compose written stories.  Although narrative writing has its roots in oral narration (Roth, ), it is generally acknowledged that speaking and writing are different modalities that each require a different style (Carvalho, ).  As such, children need to become aware of these modality differences and learn how to reflect them in the linguistic encoding of their narratives.  In both modalities, a coherent story typically consists of essential story elements including the main events, actions, and characters of the story – the referential aspects – as well as information on the thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and motivations that underlie these essential story elements – the evaluative aspects (Labov & Waletzsky, ).  The present study compares the development of evaluative aspects of spoken and written fictional narratives in middle to late elementary school, by analyzing the diversity and frequency of evaluative devices in the two modalities in a longitudinal sample.  Narratives are extended pieces of discourse that can be found in a variety of meaningful social contexts.  According to the Labovian framework (Labov, .  Labov & Waletzky, ), a narrative consists of a series of temporally ordered events whose importance is highlighted through evaluation.  More specifically, in Labov’s narrative model, the story’s main events, actions, and characters are structured in a prototypical narrative structure, comprising an initial orientation, a complication, and a resolution, which is intertwined with evaluative information, conveying a meaningful interpretation of the narrated events.  While the recapitulation of successive events is a basic requirement of a narrative, the evaluative aspects of the narrative stimulate real interest in the audience and increase the audience’s knowledge state and involvement in the story (van Beijsterveldt & van Hell, ).  The inclusion of evaluative aspects represents not only what the storyteller believes, but also what he perceives that the audience needs to be told in order to comprehend the narrative (Eaton, Collis & Lewis, ), thereby providing overall coherence to the narrative (Bamberg & Damrad-Frye, ).  Originally, Labov and Waletzky () stated that evaluation is a separate component, positioned between the complication and the resolution, which serves to emphasize the highpoint where the complication reaches its climax.  However, Labov () revised the original model and suggested that evaluative devices can be found distributed throughout the whole narrative.  Evaluative devices can be manifold.  They often involve explicit reference to the feelings, thoughts, and intentions of the story characters, but also more implicit devices that impart the narrator’s perspective are considered evaluative (e. g.  Bamberg & Damrad-Frye, .  Eaton et al. , .  Mason, .  Peterson & Biggs, .  Shiro, .  Ukrainetz, Justice, Kaderavek, Eisenberg, Gillam & Harm, .  van Beijsterveldt & van Hell, .  Zevenbergen, Whitehurst & Zevenbergen, ).  In spoken discourse, non-linguistic and paralinguistic devices, such as facial expression, gestures, and prosody, can also serve an evaluative function (Reilly, ).  Since Labov and Waletzky’s paper in , researchers have extensively studied the use of evaluation in narratives from a developmental perspective.  This is not surprising, given its potential to illuminate the development of both linguistic as well as socio-cognitive skills.  Evaluation relies on linguistic proficiency in both lexicon and syntax, but it also requires two fundamental abilities of social cognition.  the ability to adopt the perspective of the audience and adjust the story to the audience’s needs (van Dongen & Westby, ), and the ability to understand, talk about, and reflect upon characters’ actions, mental states, and beliefs, and to make inferences about them (Bamberg & Damrad-Frye, .  Eaton et al. , .  Fox, ).  Indeed, populations with atypical socio-cognitive development show differences in the use of evaluation in narratives.  For instance, it has been found that children with autism, who exhibit impaired social and emotional understanding, rely on a more restricted amount and range of evaluative devices (Losh & Capps, .  Tager-Flusberg & Sullivan, ), whereas the highly social nature of children with Williams syndrome is evident in an excessive use of evaluation in narratives (Losh, Bellugi, Reilly & Anderson, .  Reilly, Losh, Bellugi & Wulfeck, ).  Typically developing children as young as . –.  are able to adhere to the evaluative function of a narrative, and have been found to include evaluative devices in their narratives, although the use of these devices in preschoolers is still scarce (Burger & Miller, .  Haden, Haine & Fivush, .  Miller & Sperry, .  Umiker-Sebeok, ).  With age, the diversity and frequency of evaluative devices in narratives increases significantly, both in personal (e. g.  Peterson & Biggs, .  Peterson & McCabe, .  Peterson & Biggs, ), as well as in fictional narratives (e. g.  Bamberg & Damrad-Frye, .  Eaton et al. , .  Longobardi, Spataro, Renna & Rossi-Arnaud, ).  Furthermore, development may not only reside in a quantitative change, but may also alter the qualitative nature of evaluative devices.  The use of FRAMES OF MIND, for instance, illustrates this qualitative development.  Frames of mind encompass evaluative expressions that refer to cognitive, physical, and affective states of characters in a narrative.  Frames of mind are among the most commonly used evaluative devices (Sah, ).  Similar to other evaluative devices, they function to qualify the nature of links between events, and they provoke empathy and interest in the audience (Küntay & Nakamura, ).  Research has shown that young children tend to tie frames of mind to a local outcome, whereas with an increasing age, frames of mind are used to signal the hierarchical organization of the story from a global perspective, clustered around the emotional highpoints of a story (Bamberg & Damrad-Frye, .  Chen & Yan, ).  Although evaluation in narratives is an active area of research,most studies in typically developing children consider preschoolers (e. g.  Burger&Miller, .  Miller & Sperry, .  Umiker-Sebeok, ) and early childhood (e. g.  Peterson & Biggs, ), or adopt a cross-sectional approach, focusing on the comparison between preschoolers, middle childhood, adolescence, and adulthood (e. g.  Bamberg & Damrad-Frye, .  Longobardi et al. , .  Peterson & McCabe, .  Ukrainetz et al. , ).  A limitation of the latter approach is that improvement in smaller age ranges, such as in the transition from middle to late childhood, is neglected.  The transition from middle to late childhood is a particularly interesting stage in terms of evaluation.  From middle childhood onwards several areas of development undergo substantial changes, notably the areas of linguistic proficiency (Berman, .  Nippold, ) and socio-cognitive skills (Rubin, ).  A central component of later language development is the acquisition of a literate lexicon and figurative language, referring to a rich, abstract, and complex vocabulary (Berman, .  Nippold, .  Ravid & Tolchinsky, ).  Another aspect of linguistic acquisition beyond the early school years is the ability to recruit different morphosyntactic structures (Ravid & Tolchinsky, ).  This implies an increased ability to package information into larger syntactic units, reflected in syntactically denser structures and hierarchically organized texts (Berman, ).  Overall, language proficiency in later school years is characterized by the availability of multiple linguistic resources, and the ability to use them flexibly for diverse communicative purposes (Ravid & Tolchinsky, ).  Linguistically, children’s ability to deploy a larger range of advanced linguistic forms (Berman, ) might extend to an increased diversity of evaluative devices in narratives.  In addition, evaluative devices, and specifically those that require complex language skills, may increase, as children become increasingly able to call upon their sophisticated lexical and syntactic skills.  With augmented socio-cognitive skills, evaluative devices could be expected to increase in frequency, as children refine their ability to represent the story characters’ inner world, and become more conscious of the role of evaluation in involving the audience in narrative discourse.  An empirical investigation of the development of evaluation in this age group is, however, lacking.  Most ofwhat we knowabout children’s use of evaluative devices results from studies on spoken narratives.  Little is known about children’s evaluation in written narratives and how it relates to their evaluation in spoken narratives.  Developmentally, this issue is particularly relevant within the context of children’s developing linguistic literacy (Ravid & Tolchinsky, ).  Acquisition of linguistic literacy means gaining increased control over a large linguistic repertoire and simultaneously recognizing that speech and writing are essentially two different linguistic modalities (Olson, .  Ravid & Tolchinsky, ).  Speaking and writing differ, first of all, in terms of processing constraints.  compared with rapid speech production, writing does not suffer from the same time constraints and thus allows for more planning, revising, and monitoring of the production process (Ravid & Berman, ).  A writer thus has a higher control over the linguistic output.  More specifically, writing provides more off-line time to look for the appropriate words or for syntactic structures that provide a different perspective, and to ensure variety in linguistic expression.  Written discourse has therefore been found to exhibit a greater variety of vocabulary (e. g.  Chafe & Daneliewicz, .  Purcell-Gates, .  Strömqvist, Johansson, Kriz, Ragnarsdöttir, Aisenman, & Ravid, ) and to be lexically and syntactically more complex with many embedded constructions, also referred to as ‘integration’ (Perera, .  Ravid & Tolchinsky, .  Rubin, ).  Significantly more often in written than in spoken narratives, embeddedness is accomplished with constructions such as dependent clauses, nominalizations, adjectival and adverbial clauses, and attributive adjectives (Purcell-Gates, Jacobson & Degener, ).  Furthermore, the processing constraints of speech and writing interact with their communicative conditions.  Speaking is typically produced and comprehended within a shared physical context, whereas in the most prototypical writing situation, there exists a physical and temporal distance between writer and audience.  As a consequence, in order for the reader to form the right image, a writer is forced to lexicalize and grammaticalize all information that in oral discourse can also be conveyed through non-linguistic and paralinguistic channels, including gestures, prosody, facial expression, and use of shared context (Tannen, ).  Written discourse is therefore inherently more often than spoken discourse characterized by highly decontextualized language (Rader, ), that is, language that is explicit, precise, and complex, providing all the contextual information for the audience (Kantor & Rubin, ).  In other words, more than in speech, a writer must appeal to linguistic means to control and shape the flow of information (Olson, .  Ravid & Tolchinsky, ).  For written narratives it has been suggested that a writer must create a more explicit, vivid, and detailed story world, conveyed strictly through linguistic means, to set in motion the reader’s imagination (Purcell-Gates, .  Rader, .  Tannen, ).  Taking differences in processing constraints and communicative context into account, we might expect the use of evaluative devices to differ between spoken and written narratives.  More specifically, it can be expected that the lack of on-line processing constraints in writing affects the range of evaluative devices that the writer chooses, as writing allows for more accurate and more varied linguistic choices.  Furthermore, evaluative devices in written narratives could be expected to outnumber those in spoken narratives for two reasons.  First, there is more off-line time to elaborate the referential plane of the narrative with evaluative information.  This can be expected to have powerful linguistic consequences for lexically and syntactically complex devices.  Second, the writer solely relies on linguistic means to create a vivid story for the reader, whereas the speaker may also bring non-linguistic and paralinguistic means into play to achieve an evaluative effect.  The comparison of evaluation in spoken and written narratives has received little attention in previous research.  A developmental study by De Temple, Wu, and Snow () showed that late elementary school grade children used more references to characters’ internal states in their written as opposed to their spoken narratives.  Nevertheless, the results only encompassed a global narrativity rating, as their research was not specifically targeted at the study of evaluation.  A more recent study by Özyildirim () analyzed evaluative language in adults’ personal spoken and written narratives.  She concluded that the use of evaluative language was significantly more prominent in the written version, and found the frequency of occurrence of different categories of evaluative devices to be similar in the two modalities, with emotional and cognitive terms being most frequently used.  However, the study did not discuss modality differences of individual categories, nor did it address questions regarding development.  Learning to differentiate between speaking and writing, as a feature of linguistic literacy, has a long developmental timecourse.  Previous research has demonstrated that sensitivity to modality differences is present early in childhood (e. g.  Kaderavek & Sulzby, .  Purcell-Gates, .  Sulzby, ), but does not extend directly into writing tasks in elementary school (Fey, Catts, Proctor-Williams, Tomblin & Zhang, .  Gillam & Johnston, .  Scott & Windsor, ).  Only from the age of nine does a cross-over effect start to occur, with written texts becoming linguistically superior to spoken texts.  From middle elementary school onwards, speaking and writing thus become increasingly differentiated (Kroll, ).  An explanation for this cross-over effect can be found in the interplay of several areas of development, some of which have been mentioned previously.  First, a high control of all the components of language, typical of later language development (Berman, .  Nippold, ), enables the developing writer to reflect differences between speaking and writing in the linguistic encoding of discourse to a greater extent (Ravid & Tolchinsky, ).  Second, developing maturity in socio-cognitive skills enhances writers’ awareness of the absent reader and increases their desire to engage in interaction with this audience (Kantor & Rubin, .  Rubin, ).  Third, from middle to late elementary school, children begin to automatize their handwriting and spelling, which frees cognitive resources that can be dedicated to higher-level aspects of composition (Alamargot & Chanquoy, .  Carvalho, ), such as reflecting modality differences in written texts.  Finally, education provides the school-age child with ample exposure to reading and writing tasks, increasing their sensitivity to characteristics of written discourse.  Similarly, with increasingly demanding writing tasks, requiring a more thoughtful and reflective approach (Graham, Harris & Olinghouse, ), children start to plan before they write, learn to revise, and begin to evaluate whether their texts address the audience’s needs.  <Middle> The present study.  The present study aims to enhance our understanding of the development of evaluation in narratives from middle to late childhood, within the context of learning to produce spoken and written narratives.  In considering the interaction of modality differences with evaluation in narratives in this age group, our research contributes to the literature in two important ways.  first, we extend previous research on children’s use of evaluation in narratives, by conducting a longitudinal study in middle to late childhood, an age range that has previously been understudied in this respect.  Second, by comparing evaluation in spoken and written narratives, we assess children’s ability to reflect modality differences in a significant, yet neglected, area of narrative discourse.  Investigating these issues in this population is relevant, given the development of linguistic and sociocognitive skills, and the crucial steps in writing development, typically occurring between middle and late childhood.  We explored and compared the development of evaluative devices in spoken and written fictional narratives from fourth to sixth grade.  Narratives were elicited with a wordless picture book that provided enough referential support along with the opportunity for evaluative elaboration.  In short, ten categories of evaluative devices were considered, including direct speech, emotive terms, intellectual terms, perceptual terms, negative qualifiers, hedges, modal verbs, figurative language, evaluative comments, and intensifiers.  We chose these categories based on their frequent occurrence in previous research, or on the fact that they rely on complex language skills (e. g.  modal verbs) or socio-cognitive skills (e. g.  figurative language) that develop later in childhood, rendering them particularly relevant for this age group.  Both diversity and frequency of evaluative devices were analyzed.  The first aim of the study was to investigate how the use of evaluative language in spoken and written narratives changes from fourth to sixth grade.  We expected to find an increase in both the diversity and frequency of evaluative language, as a result of overall improvement in linguistic proficiency, and increased socio-cognitive maturity.  The developmental increase was expected to be most prevalent in written narratives, as a result of an increasing automatization of spelling and handwriting, and a gradual change in writing strategies.  The second aim of the study was to compare the use of evaluative devices between spoken and written narratives.  Based on differences in processing constraints and communicative context, we expected that children’s written narratives would possess a higher diversity and a higher frequency of evaluative devices compared to their spoken narratives.  In terms of particular categories of evaluative devices, we expected that all categories would exhibit such a modality difference.  However, we predicted the modality difference to be particularly evident for the evaluative categories that in the literature have also been referred to as markers of decontextualized language, such as intellectual terms (Curenton & Justice, .  Greenhalgh & Strong, ), direct speech (Sulzby, .  Sulzby & Zecker, ), and figurative language (Halliday, .  Olson, ).  Furthermore, we expected the category of modal verbs, requiring advanced syntactic skills, to be particularly prone to modality differences.  For the categories of emotive and perceptual terms, evaluative comments, intensifiers, negative qualifiers, and hedges, no strong a priori hypotheses were proposed. Participants.  Participants were tested at two developmental time-points, namely in fourth grade and later in sixth grade.  Children with neurodevelopmental disorders were excluded from participation.  At the start of the study,  Dutch children in fourth grade (Age M= . , SD = · months) took part in the study.  The children in the study came from four primary schools in the Netherlands.  Information on socioeconomic status for the individual children was unavailable, but examining factor scores reflecting parental education, income, and work status provided by the Netherlands Institute for Social Research for the zip code areas the schools were located in, suggest a middle to middle-high socioeconomic background for the children (M= ·, SD = ·.  scale in the Netherlands ranges from –· to ·).  Parents gave their active consent for the participation of their child.  Due to dropouts throughout the years, the final sample consisted of ninety-three children (·% girls) in the second testing phase in sixth grade (Age M= . , SD = · months).  Participants showed normal non-verbal cognitive ability (M= ·, SD = ·), as assessed by the Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices (standard score.  M= , SD = .  Raven, ) and average vocabulary ability (M= ·, SD = ·), as assessed by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (standard score.  M= , SD = .  Dunn & Dunn, , ).  Analyses were conducted on the data of children who participated both in fourth and in sixth grade.  Materials and procedure Testing was done by the first author and by three trained research assistants.  One individual session and one classroom session were organized.  The Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the elicitation of the spoken narratives were administered during the individual session, whereas the written narratives were collected during the classroom session.  Individual sessions took place in a quiet room in each of the schools.  The Expression, Reception, and Recall of Narrative Instrument (ERRNI.  Bishop, ) was used to elicit the spoken and written narratives.  The ERRNI is a wordless picture book that tests children’s ability to tell a story based on pictures, understand the story, and remember it after a delay.  In the current study, only story-telling ability was assessed.
