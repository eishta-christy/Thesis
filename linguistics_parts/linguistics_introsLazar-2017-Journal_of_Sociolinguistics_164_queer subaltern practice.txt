INTRODUCTION.  SITUATING THE STUDY This article examines the nexus of non-normative gender/sexual and national identities within Singapore’s contemporary LGBTQ movement.  Drawing upon Puar’s concept of ‘homonormative nationalism’ or ‘homonationalism’ (Puar 2007), I view it speciﬁcally as a form of discourse, and extend it, particularly, as a discursive strategy employed by a queer subaltern constituency in ‘doing’ a politics of pragmatic resistance in an illiberal city-state.  My focus is the Pink Dot movement in Singapore (or ‘Pink Dot SG’, a name which aligns sexual/ gender non-normativity with the nation), launched in 2009, which organises a large-scale, free-to-all public rally, themed ‘Freedom to Love’.  This is held annually in Hong Lim Park, the only public space in Singapore which allows the gathering of a mass assembly without an ofﬁcial license.  In this article, I explore the ‘impossible presence’ (Chan 2012) of a visibly optic queer event in a city-state that continues to criminalise gay sex and maintains a resolutely heteronormative public sphere.  My point of focus is on the promotional online videos produced annually, which have been pivotal to the success of the Pink Dot movement (Philips 2013).  A close multimodal analysis of one of the videos, titled ‘For Family.  For Friends.  For Love’, is analysed in order to explicate the discourse of homonationalism at work.  The analysis is situated within the dual perspectives of critical discourse studies (CDS) and ‘southern theory’ or, as I shall term it, ‘southern praxis’.  While it is assumed that sociolinguists are familiar with CDS, and so it requires less explanation, a southern praxis perspective will be outlined in greater detail.  CDS, motivated by goals of social justice and emancipation, is a perspective interested in the discursive dimensions of social issues that sustain asymmetrical power relations, which privilege certain groups in a society whilst disadvantaging and marginalising others.  the latter of which entails closure of life possibilities for disenfranchised subjects.  The term ‘critical’ is understood, broadly, to encompass the complex dynamics of power relations at work in any situation, in any given sociopolitical-historical moment.  While CDS has an established tradition of investigating various forms of hegemonic power structures, research on resistance as discursively articulated by historically marginalised groups remains largely underdeveloped.  The potential exists, nonetheless.  note, for example, Wodak and Meyer’s statement.  ‘CDA [or CDS] researchers are interested in the way discourse (re) produces social domination, that is the power abuse of one group over others, and how dominated groups may discursively resist such abuse’ (Wodak and Meyer 2009.  9, emphasis mine).  CDS, therefore, has the capacity to engage more fully with various aspects and interrelations of power, from the points of view of institutional structures as well as of marginalised individuals and communities that engage dominant structures in agentive ways (see also Lazar 2014).  In this study, power relations are viewed both in terms of state and heteronormative hegemonies, and especially, in terms of discursive resistance exercised by a marginalised LGBTQ community.  ‘Southern theory’ (e. g.  Comaroff and Comaroff 2012.  Connell 2007) or ‘southern praxis’, as I call it, refers to a mode of intervention that seeks to unsettle the hegemony of Northern-centricity in governing the geopolitics of knowledge globally, in favour of interconnected and multiple sites from which theory and practice get constituted.  From a critical perspective, I argue that this is not solely about the development of intellectual projects, but has important implications for political organising and lived experiences as well.  The imbrication of theory and practice/action, as praxis, is absolutely essential for a critical enterprise.  Aligned with Mohanty (2003), I use the ‘North’/‘South’ terminology to generally ‘distinguish between afﬂuent, privileged nations and communities and economically and politically marginalised nations and communities’ (2003.  226).  While these terms loosely distinguish the northern and southern hemispheres, afﬂuence and marginality of course do not line up within this geographical frame in any stable way.  As the Comaroffs (2012.  7) put it, there are enclaves of ‘the south in the north and the north in the south’.  The terminology, therefore, is necessarily imprecise, slippery and porous, and for this reason, I ﬁnd Mohanty’s formulation of ‘nations and communities’ extremely useful.  Having said this, the North/South terminology serves a political, explanatory function that draws attention to the experiences of colonisation, historically as well as discursively, and the structured imbalances of power and inﬂuence across geoscapes.  The notion of the ‘South’ or periphery, moreover, importantly functions as an analytical category to denote a politicised positionality in regard to theory and practice.  The periphery as an ‘ex-centric location’ (Bhabha 1994) has been conceptualised as offering an ‘angle of vision’ or a ‘special vantage point’, arising from an acute awareness of borders and boundaries, which are exclusionary and enabling in providing pathways to navigate between the borders (Comaroff and Comaroff 2012.  hooks 1984.  Mohanty 2003).  What might constitute a southern praxis.  Here, I outline three points pertinent to the present study.  Firstly, a southern praxis involves de-centring Northern-centric prerogatives in theorising which, arising from an inadequate recognition of their own socio-historical specificities, are presented as universally agenda-setting.  As a form of discursive colonisation, a Northerncentric lens, through which the rest of the world is read, profoundly excludes the experiences and social thought of the periphery, views the South merely as a source of ‘unprocessed data’ in need of Northern theoretical illumination, and ‘others’ the South as exotically different or playing catch-up with the North as the normative point of reference (Comaroff and Comaroff 2012.  Connell 2007.  Mohanty 2003.  Spivak 2000).  For example, in sexuality research, a Northern-centric ‘rights’ discourse has been assumed to be universally applicable, and globalisation is seen as the unilineal spread of Northern models of homosexuality (Altman 1997.  Warner 1993).  In assuming a global gay identity, Altman (1997.  417), for instance, argues for the ‘emergence of a Western style politicised homosexuality in Asia’ and places Asian gays in a place of deferred arrival in a normatively woven Northern narrative of gay liberation.  Secondly, decolonisation of knowledge goes beyond demystifying Northern privilege to contributing positively towards a globally inclusive theory-making and practice.  Resisting erasure and ‘othering’ of the South means viewing the South as legitimate producers of theory in their own right about the social world they inhabit, and re-writing ideas of Northern experts from their situated insights (Comaroff and Comaroff 2012.  Connell 2007).  The Comaroffs (2012) rightly advocate a move from ‘grand theory’ towards ‘grounded theory’, the latter of which involves a historically contextualised knowledge production based on a lived praxis.  Fundamentally, then, a southern praxis eschews ‘monopolies of truth’ (Das 1995), such that all knowledge production, regardless from the North or the South, must necessarily be self-reflexive and acknowledge its social, economic, political, historical, and geographical groundedness.  Thirdly, a southern praxis adopts the view of theory and practice as a transnationally shared process achieved through dialogue and mutual learning.  As Connell notes (2007), engagement, critique, respect and recognition form the bases of mutual learning, whereby the North too must learn as actively as the South.  Mutual learning can be in the form of developing an interconnected set of intellectual projects that emerge from varied social starting points as well as forging transnational alliances for political organising (Connell 2007.  Mohanty 2003).  A critical southern praxis strives to move from a politics of identity towards building a transnational politics of solidarity.  Writing about homosexuality in Brazil, Parker (1999.  231) outlines a politics of solidarity as that which is ‘capable of hearing not only our own pain and suffering, but also the pain and suffering of others, subject to the multiple forms of oppression, exploitation, and injustice that have been produced by the contemporary world system’.  This is needed for political organising in both the North and the South.  To be sure, CDS and a southern praxis are consonant perspectives.  Both are modes of critical intervention into hegemonic discourses of power and privilege, and are aligned with excluded, marginalised communities.  Both also believe that knowledge production is not an apolitical activity, but is invested in relations of power and ideology.  However, while CDS with its welldeveloped linguistic and semiotic frameworks offers a sharp analytical instrument for discursive critique of knowledge practices of various kinds, CDS scholarship itself, built upon and propagating Northern hegemonic epistemologies, can also learn from a southern praxis.  The critical analysis of the Pink Dot video, from a southern/CDS perspective, builds upon two sets of conceptual ideas, which shall be explained below.  The first is ‘pragmatism’, through which the sociopolitical contexts of Singapore and Singapore’s LGBTQ movement can be historically understood.  Resistance in pragmatic terms, or ‘pragmatic resistance’ (Yue 2012), is introduced, against which the emergence of the Pink Dot movement and its tactical approach are set out.  The second set of ideas is ‘homonormativity’ (Duggan 2003) and ‘homonationalism’ (Puar 2007), and how these are differently, and strategically, implicated in the Pink Dot SG movement.  In the light of these conceptual discussions, the critical analysis of the Pink Dot video in terms of the discourse of homonationalism as a politics of pragmatic resistance is then undertaken.  In concluding, I return to some observations about ‘doing’ queer politics from a southern praxis perspective.  <Middle> THE POLITICS OF PRAGMATIC NECESSITY.  The concept of pragmatism is central to understanding the production of the LGBTQ culture and activism in Singapore, both from the point of view of state governance and in terms of a tactical response formulated by a marginalised queer constituency.  As a mode of governance, the ideology of pragmatism was developed as an ‘instrumental rationality’ (Chua 1995.  59) by the ruling PAP government (the People’s Action Party) for postcolonial nation-building since the 1960s.  Based on a survivalist ethos, it justified overt government intervention in all areas of social life, rationalised as ‘natural’, ‘necessary’ and ‘realistic’ solutions to challenges of nation-building (Chua 1995).  Underlying state pragmatism was a clear economic imperative.  Economic growth was seen as the best guarantor of social and political stability necessary for national survival, and material improvements were regarded as the most tangible index of ‘taking care of the collective good’ (Chua 1995).  In practice, the policies rationalised on pragmatic grounds often proved to be undemocratic and unapologetically anti-liberal.  Also, rather than ‘in principle’, the exercise of pragmatism has been ‘contextual’ and ‘ad hoc’, which could suddenly alter the trajectory of previously established policies by the introduction of radically newer ones, and could prove inconsistent and contradictory to existing policies.  The PAP government, however, while maintaining the formal features of a democratic electoral politics, has promised that in the final analysis its policies would lead to the establishment of a stable communitarian democracy.  Hence, pragmatism as an operative logic has achieved popular legitimacy among Singaporeans, and is constitutive of the ideological consensus between the government and the people.  Referring to the contradictions as ambivalences between non-liberalism and neoliberalism, and rationalism and irrationalism, Yue (2012.  1) describes the PAP’s practice as an ‘illiberal pragmatism’, which is central to understanding the governance of homosexuality and the production of an LGBTQ culture in Singapore.  For example, even though gay sex is criminalised through the maintenance of Section 377A (‘Outrage of Decency’) of the penal code, same-sex cohabitationispermitted througha recent change inproperty law, arising froman over-supply of public housing, which makes it possible for same-sex couples to copurchase government-subsidised flats.  Thus, although a hegemonic discourse of heteronormative home ownership continues to prevail, the new government policy has unwittingly made possible non-heteronormative domesticity.  In another example, motivated by the government’s desires for Singapore to become a global city in transnational capitalist networks, queer involvement in creative industries, for instance, is accepted, turning arts and culture into commodities which add value to the country’s economy (Chan 2012.  Yue 2012).  LGBTQ communities in Singapore, therefore, have circumnavigated around the ambivalences of an illiberal pragmatic governance, in order to survive and thrive.  The same applies to the LGBTQ movement in Singapore, necessitating queer activists to negotiate the legal restrictions and stigmatisation of nonnormative sexualities and gender through a tactical response of pragmatic resistance.  Pragmatic resistance refers to a sustained collective strategy which seeks to advance the LGBTQ movement, while ensuring that it survives the scrutiny and potential retaliation of the government (Chua 2014).  Although queer activists in Singapore, like their counterparts elsewhere on the globe, want to be allowed to live full self-determined lives, their approach reflects a highly contextual and reflexive response of ‘toe[ing] the line, while pushing boundaries’ (Chua 2014.  20).  The approach has been highly adept at reading signals and shifts in the sociopolitical environment in order to seize as well as create opportunities to progress (pushing boundaries), while not jeopardising the survival of the movement (toeing the line).  Such acts as organising street protests or belligerently demanding rights could be seen to pose a threat to existing power structures, and are avoided.  Tactics, too, are continuously adapted, escalated or scaled down, based on earlier lessons learnt (Chua 2014).  Pink Dot SG and pragmatic resistance.  Here, I outline specifically the emergence of the Pink Dot movement as a mode of pragmatic resistance, demonstrating its tactical manoeuvring around the illiberal pragmatism of governance.  In her book, Mobilizing Gay Singapore, Lynette Chua (2014) outlines several factors which shaped the tactical direction taken with the Pink Dot initiative, as a historic moment in the LGBTQ movement of Singapore.  One important factor was the unsuccessful outcome of a parliamentary petition advanced by Singaporean gay activists to decriminalise gay sex in 2007.  Under Section 377A of the penal code, sexual intimacy between gay men, even when consensual, is punishable by a two-year jail term.  Expressed through the language of rights, the gay activists who had spearheaded the petition had no expectation that the law would be repealed, but wanted to force political attention to be paid to it.  As a result, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made an assurance that Section 377A would not be enforced against gays in consensual, private situations.  However, the law was retained symbolically, sending a clear message that LGBTQ interests were not to be prioritised above those of the heteronormative mainstream which, it was argued, had yet to accept nonnormative sexualities.  The unsuccessful result of the petition confirmed local queer activists’ expectation that a Northern-style liberal rights discourse was not an effective instrument for social change in Singapore.  It became clear, too, that legal restrictions against gay men would not be removed unless mainstream values shifted in favour of doing so.  This meant that garnering a visible support base of straight allies and demonstrating alignment with mainstream goals of social cohesion and harmony were imperative.  Secondly, in the wake of the petition to repeal Section 377A, there emerged a vocal countermovement led by a conservative Christian minority group.  This required the LGBTQ constituency to respond cautiously and nonconfrontationally, so as not to be seen as causing social disharmony, thus underscoring the importance of achieving a wider support base.  Thirdly, an economically-motivated trend towards social liberalisation led to the government relaxing its licensing rules for public speech and assembly in Hong Lim Park, the site of Singapore’s ‘Speaker’s Corner’, in 2008.  As long as organisers of events pre-registered with the police, and did not broach politically sensitive topics on race and religion, they were no longer required to obtain a license to hold public gatherings at the site.  The new exemption rule gave queer activists an opportunity for collective mobilisation in the Park, leading to the inception of Pink Dot SG in 2009.  After much deliberation among queer activists, the decision was made not to hold a Northern-style protest or gay pride parade that could be seen as politically confrontational and off-putting to the masses.  Instead, the concept of organising a free-to-all carnival-like rally, aimed at social cohesion and mobilising mass support, was birthed.  Under the banner ‘Freedom to Love’, the event aimed to ‘raise awareness and foster deeper understanding of the basic human need to love and be loved, regardless of one’s sexual orientation or gender identity’ (Pink Dot SG 2013).  The idea was for anyone to simply show up at a designated time in the park attired in pink, for a picnic, some entertainment and speeches by LGBTQ ambassadors.  The highlight of the event was the formation of a giant human Pink Dot, to be photographed aerially from a nearby hotel for a visual record of collective solidarity.  At the ﬁrst Pink Dot SG rally in 2009, 2,500 people – queer, and straight allies – showed up.  Since 2009, Pink Dot SG has been an annual event, attracting increasingly larger crowds.  In 2015, the estimated turnout was 28,000 people (The Straits Times, 14 June 2015).  In the run-up to the Pink Dot SG rallies, the organisers produce a promotional video, different each year, which they circulate widely online.  In what follows, the 2014 ofﬁcial video will be analysed to show the emergent tactical discourse as a form of pragmatic resistance.  THE DISCOURSE OF HOMONATIONALISM AS PRAGMATIC RESISTANCE.  Evident in the Pink Dot SG videos is a discourse of homonormative nationalism.  The terms ‘homonormativity’ and ‘homonationalism’ were coined by Duggan (2003) and Puar (2007), respectively, in regard to the U. S.  context.  I briefly outline these concepts, and then explain how they are put to work differently in the context of Pink Dot SG.  Duggan (2003.  50) defines homonormativity as.  a politics that does not contest dominant heteronormative assumptions and institutions, but upholds and sustains them, while promising the possibility of a demobilized gay constituency and a privatized gay culture anchored in domesticity and consumption.  According to Duggan, homonormativity signals a new neoliberal sexual politics that is consonant with broader neoliberal ‘equality politics’ in the U. S. A.  since the mid-1990s, as manifested in the rhetoric of U. S.  politicians, corporations and the media.  She is critical of U. S.  gay civil rights groups that have adopted this neoliberal rhetoric, thus moving away from a broad-based progressive queer politics.  Homonormativity, she argues, leads to a shrinking of the gay public sphere and a ‘stripped-down equality’ (Duggan 2003.  xx), seen merely in terms of access to institutions of domestic privacy, the ‘free market’, and patriotism.  Although homonormativity is complicit with the reproduction of heteronormativity, and appears depoliticised, when viewed through the lens of pragmatic resistance, the case of Pink Dot SG, I suggest, can be read as a form of tactical politics within illiberal state structures.  Instead of shrinking the queer public sphere, leveraging on a discourse of homonormativity, in fact, offers the Pink Dot movement an opportunity to expand, strategically, the queer public sphere.  This applies beyond the conspicuous staging of the rally for one day, to a wider reach through its videos and other content posted on its website and other media platforms.  Puar (2007, 2013) links the concept of homonormativity explicitly to a national scale, in theorising practices of U. S.  sexual exceptionalism, and terms this phenomenon ‘national homonormativity’ or ‘homonationalism’.  She shows the collusion between homosexuality and nationalism in U. S.  national rhetorics of patriotic inclusion against orientalist invocations of Islamic terrorists.  The strategic appropriation of non-normative sexualities for U. S.  nationalist agendas is explained in the following terms.  For contemporary US nationalism and patriotism, the production of gay and queer bodies is crucial to the deployment of nationalism, in so far as these perverse bodies reiterate heterosexuality as the norm but also because certain domesticated homosexual bodies provide ammunition to reinforce nationalistic projects.  (Puar 2007.  39) Homonationalism is viewed as an inevitable facet of modernity, and is characterised by a number of features.  For example, the relationship between non-normative sexualities and the nation is seen to be convivial rather than antagonistic.  Homonationalism is also primarily exclusionary in that it privileges queer white bodies, and denies homonational subjectivity to undesirable ‘others’ based on such criteria as race, ethnicity, religion and age.  Furthermore, as argued by Puar, homonationalism is neither an identity nor a political position.  In the case of Singapore, in so far as official discourses on the ‘global city’ appropriate non-normative sexualities and genders to create the city-state as cosmopolitan, tolerant and open (Obendorf 2012), it can be said that homonationalism, as a feature of modernity, does get enacted tacitly and grudgingly.  However, unlike Puar, my interest in homonationalism here is from the perspective of a queer subaltern practice, rather than from a position of institutional state power.  Specifically, my uptake on the concept of homonationalism is how an LGBTQ movement yokes together homonormativity and nationalism as a political discursive strategy.
