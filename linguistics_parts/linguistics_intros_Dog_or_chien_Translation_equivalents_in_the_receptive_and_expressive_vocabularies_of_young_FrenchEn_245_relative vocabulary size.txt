 I N T R O D U C T I O N Decades of research suggests that bilingual infants reach linguistic milestones, such as babbling and producing ﬁrst words, at the same rate as monolingual infants, despite the fact that the input that bilingual infants hear is much more complex (Nicoladis & Genesee, .  Oller, Eilers, Urbano & Cobo-Lewis, .  Pearson, Fernández, Lewedeg & Oller, ).  Bilingual infants are often exposed to two languages from birth, and they must use the speciﬁc properties of this dual input to diﬀerentiate one language from the other.  Despite these unique challenges, bilingual infants form lexical representations for words in each of their languages early on as they quickly begin to incorporate translation equivalents (TEs) into their vocabularies.  TEs, or doublets, are defined as lexical representations that a speaker has in each language for the same concept (e. g. , dog in English and chien in French).  Importantly, by the end of the second year, bilingual children’s vocabularies are composed of an average of approximately % TEs (Bosch & Ramon-Casas, .  David & Wei, .  Pearson, Fernández & Oller, .  Poulin-Dubois, Bialystok, Blaye, Polonia & Yott, ), although there is typically a great deal of variability between children.  This feat is quite impressive as it suggests that bilingual children are able to understand early on in development that two words can mean the same thing.  However, although the acquisition of TEs during infancy is an important part of bilingual vocabulary development, there are still many gaps in the literature on this topic, as most research has centered on case studies, or studies conducted with very small sample sizes.  More importantly, most studies on TE acquisition exclusively utilize parent report measures of vocabulary, and very few studies have investigated the development of TEs over time, using longitudinal designs.  As a result, our knowledge of the rate of TE development during infancy is quite limited.  In order to address these gaps in the literature, two experiments were conducted.  The aim of the ﬁrst experiment was to examine changes in the proportion of TEs on the MacArthur Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) across three developmental time-points.  By documenting TE acquisition in a sample of thirty-four French–English bilingual children at . , . , and . , our goal was to gain a better understanding of how young bilinguals acquire TEs during a period of accelerated vocabulary growth.  A secondary goal of this experiment was to acquire a better understanding of how changes in bilingual input and relative vocabulary size shape TE development, by examining the relation between changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size, and the proportion of TEs.  The aim of the second experiment presented in this paper was to investigate the utility of a direct measure of TE comprehension, and to compare the proportion of TEs derived from this measure with parent report of the same subset of words.  Within the vocabulary development literature, there has been some concern that parents of bilingual children might confound their child’s languages when reporting their receptive word knowledge on vocabulary checklists (Pearson et al. , ) such as the CDI (Fenson et al. , .  Trudeau, Frank & Poulin-Dubois, ).  The goal of this second experiment was to determine whether parent report of TEs mirrors a direct, laboratory-based measure of children’s TE development.  Language exposure.  The amount of time that a child is exposed to each of his or her languages appears to be signiﬁcantly related to vocabulary development in each language, with discrepancies in language exposure often leading to unbalanced vocabulary development (Bedore et al. , .  Bosch & Ramon-Casas, .  David & Wei, .  De Anda, Arias-Trejo, Poulin-Dubois, Zesiger & Friend, a.  De Houwer, .  De Houwer, Bornstein & De Coster, .  Eilers, Pearson & Cobo-Lewis, .  Grüter, Hurtado, Marchman & Fernald, .  Hoﬀ, .  Hurtado, Grüter, Marchman & Fernald, .  Pearson et al. , .  Place & Hoﬀ, .  Poulin-Dubois et al. , .  Thordardottir, ).  Several studies, for example, now show that young bilinguals tend to produce fewer words in each of their individual languages compared to monolingual infants (Core, Hoﬀ, Rumiche & Señor, .  Hoﬀ, Core, Place, Rumiche, Señor & Parra, .  Hoﬀ, Rumiche, Burridge, Ribot & Welsh, .  Oller, Pearson & Cobo-Lewis, .  Pearson, Fernández & Oller, ).  Furthermore, when exposure is unbalanced, children also have a tendency to produce more words in their dominant (L) compared to their non-dominant (L) language (Hurtado et al. , .  Pearson & Fernández, .  Pearson et al. , ).  Interestingly, however, when total (the number of words a child knows) or total conceptual (the number of concepts a child knows) vocabulary are taken into account, bilinguals are typically considered to produce as many words as their monolingual peers (Core et al. , .  Hoﬀ et al. , .  Junker & Stockman, .  Pearson et al. , ).  Given that it is well established that language exposure has a signiﬁcant impact on early vocabulary development, it is reasonable to think that the relative distribution of exposure in each language might also have an impact on the proportion of TEs that a child acquires.  However, whereas balanced exposure should theoretically result in balanced rates of TE acquisition, most children are not equally exposed to the languages that they hear (Hoﬀ, ).  Recent research has shown that although many parents make an eﬀort to provide balanced levels of exposure for their children, generally speaking, strategies such as the one-parent–one-language rule are not eﬀective in achieving this goal (De Houwer, ).  Other factors, such as the language preference of the child, the majority status of the child’s languages, the contexts in which they learn their languages, and individual diﬀerences in the quantity and quality of input speakers provide for the child, all contribute to uneven exposure patterns and, very often, uneven patterns of vocabulary growth (De Houwer, .  MacLeod, Fabiano-Smith, Boegner-Pagé & Fontolliet, .  Place & Hoﬀ, ).  Interestingly, although most bilingual children have at least some TEs in their early receptive and expressive vocabularies (Bosch & Ramon-Casas, .  Byers-Heinlein & Werker, .  De Houwer et al. , .  Deuchar & Quay, .  Genesee & Nicoladis, .  Holowka, Brosseau-Lapre & Petitto, .  Junker & Stockman, .  Nicoladis & Secco, .  Pearson et al. , .  Pearson et al. , .  Quay, .  Schelletter, ), there continues to be some debate in the literature regarding the extent to which quantity of language exposure plays a role in facilitating TE acquisition.  Whereas there is evidence to suggest that children who are raised in environments that are more conducive to balanced language acquisition tend to acquire a greater proportion of TEs early on in development (David & Wei, .  Montanari, .  Pearson et al. , ), there are also studies showing that quantity of L exposure is a poor predictor of how many TEs a child has in their vocabulary (Byers-Heinlein & Werker, .  Lanvers, .  Poulin-Dubois, D. , Blaye, Coutya & Bialystok, ).  Of note is the fact that although there is a great deal of individual variability in the proportion of TEs that a child acquires, we know that TE acquisition generally increases over time in relation to children’s vocabulary production (Montanari, ).  However, although several studies have now examined the process of TE acquisition in young bilinguals, the majority of these studies have been cross-sectional in nature, and few have examined the role that changes in language exposure and vocabulary ratios play in facilitating the acquisition of TEs longitudinally in the course of early vocabulary development.  A main goal of the present study was to examine how changes in relative language exposure and vocabulary size impact TE acquisition in very young bilinguals using a longitudinal design.  Measuring TE acquisition during infancy.  To date, the majority of research on TE acquisition in young bilinguals has been conducted using case studies and parent report measures, such as the CDI (David & Wei, .  De Houwer et al. , .  Junker & Stockman, .  Legacy, Zesiger, Friend & Poulin-Dubois, ).  Although the CDI is well established as a valid and reliable measure of vocabulary development in both monolingual and bilingual infants, and is praised for its quick and easy to use format, there has been some concern that parents of bilingual infants might confound their child’s languages when reporting their word knowledge on vocabulary checklists (Pearson et al. , ).  Importantly, although the CDI should ideally be ﬁlled out by two expert reporters, in the case of bilingual infants this is not always possible, and most often it is the primary caregiver who ﬁlls out both forms of the CDI.  Interestingly, De Houwer, Bornstein, and Leach () showed that single reporter CDI reports often underestimate monolingual children’s RECEPTIVE vocabulary knowledge.  This suggests that inaccurate reporting of vocabulary knowledge by single reporters might also aﬀect bilingual vocabulary estimates, as this task is much more complex for parents of bilingual children.  Whereas trying to diﬀerentiate the words that a bilingual child SAYS in each of their languages can be diﬃcult for parents (Lust et al. , ), trying to diﬀerentiate the words that a child COMPREHENDS in each language can be even more challenging.  As a result, Experiment  was conducted to address this issue.  By assessing the proportion of TEs that infants comprehended using a direct, touch-screen measure of vocabulary comprehension, and comparing these results to parent report of the same subsets of words on the CDI, we were able to determine how accurately parents were able to report on their child’s early comprehension of TEs.  <Middle> The present study.   In order to address gaps in the literature surrounding the acquisition of TEs in early bilingual vocabulary development, two studies were conducted.  Experiment  had two main goals.  (i) to gain a better understanding of how French–English bilinguals acquire TEs over time, by examining changes in the proportion of TEs on the CDI across three developmental time-points.  and (ii) to determine the roles that linguistic input and vocabulary growth play in shaping TE acquisition.  In order to accomplish these goals, TEs in infants’ expressive vocabularies were measured at . , . , and .  using the MacArthur Bates CDI, and changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size were examined as potential predictors of change in the proportion of TEs across waves.  We hypothesized that more balanced ratios of exposure and productive vocabulary size would be associated with larger proportions of TEs at each wave.  The purpose of Experiment , on the other hand, was to compare a direct, touch-screen measure of infants’ TE comprehension with parent report of the same subset of words.  We conducted this experiment to test the hypothesis that parents may be under- or over-reporting their children’s comprehension of TEs.  In accomplishing these goals, we aimed to acquire a better understanding not only of what TE acquisition looks like during early bilingual vocabulary development, but also how changes in input and relative vocabulary size shape this development, and how we can best measure the acquisition of TEs in bilingual infants’ receptive vocabularies.  By using a longitudinal design, as well as a direct measure of early TE comprehension, we aimed to provide an original contribution to the literature on bilingual vocabulary development.  EXPERIMENT.  M E T H O D.  Participants Participants were recruited through birth lists provided by a governmental health agency in Montréal, Canada.  In order to be eligible for each study, bilingual participants were required to be French–English bilinguals from birth, and needed to have at least % exposure to their second language.  Exposure to a third language, if any, was below %.  Participants from Experiment  attended three waves of data collection, beginning at . .  However, due to the longitudinal nature of the study, only children who contributed data at all three waves were included in the ﬁnal sample.  At Wave  of data collection, ﬁfty-seven infants participated in the study.  However, four children whose parents failed to return the vocabulary checklists were excluded.  Participants who completed Wave  of data collection were then asked to return six months later for Wave .  At this wave, a total of thirteen additional children were excluded due to missing data (n = ) or no longer meeting the language requirements for the study (n = ).  Wave  of data collection occurred seven months after participants returned for Wave .  At this wave, six additional participants were excluded due to missing data (n = ) or no longer meeting language requirements (n = ).  The ﬁnal cross-wave sample consisted of thirty-four bilinguals ( males and  females).  At Wave , children ranged in age from . · to . · (M = . ·) and were exposed to their non-dominant language an average of % of the time (M = %, SD = %, Range = –%).  At Wave , children ranged in age from . · to . · (M = . ·), with a mean level of L exposure of % (M = %, SD = %, Range = –%).  Finally, at Wave  children ranged in age from . · to . · (M = . ·), with a mean level of L exposure at % (SD = %, Range = –%).  Eighty-two percent of mothers held a university degree.  Materials.  Language Exposure Assessment Tool (LEAT).  This questionnaire has been used in previous studies to measure infants’ exposure to the languages that they hear (De Anda, Bosch, Poulin-Dubois, Zesiger & Friend, b).  The experimenter conducted an interview with a parent at each wave of data collection, to ask who communicates with the child on a weekly basis (e. g.  parents, educator, grandparents, etc. ), what languages they speak to the child, and for how long.  These data were then entered into an electronic form, and an estimate of the proportion of time that the child is exposed to each language was then calculated at . , . , and . , respectively.  CDI.  Words and Gestures.  The CDI.  WG is a vocabulary checklist that is completed by parents, and which measures infants’ receptive and expressive vocabulary at .  to . .  The American English (Fenson et al. , ) and French Canadian (Trudeau et al. , ) adaptations were used to measure vocabulary, with the English and French Canadian adaptations containing  and  words, respectively.  There are a total of  TE pairs on this form of the CDI.  CDI.  Words and Sentences.  The CDI.  WS is a parent report vocabulary checklist that measures toddlers’ expressive vocabulary, from .  to . .  The English and French Canadian adaptations (Fenson et al. , .  Trudeau et al. , ) contain  and  words, respectively, and include  TE pairs.  Procedure.  Expert speakers (parents, grandparents, educators, etc. ) who spoke to the children in each language were asked to ﬁll out the CDI in English or French at each wave, and two calculations were performed.  one to obtain an estimate of the proportion of TEs including cognates (words that are similar in both spelling and sound, such as pizza and pizza or jeans and jeans) and semi-cognates (words that are similar in sound but diﬀer slightly in spelling, such as banana and banane or mittens and mitaines), and one to obtain an estimate of the proportion of TEs excluding cognates and semi-cognates.  First, the total proportion of TEs including cognates and semi-cognates was calculated by summing the number of identiﬁed TE pairs on the CDIs and multiplying this score by two.  This number was then divided by the child’s total vocabulary minus non-equivalents (words that have no translation on the other CDI form).  A second proportion excluding cognates and semi-cognates was then calculated by summing the identiﬁed TE pairs on the CDIs, subtracting all cognate and semi-cognate pairs, and multiplying by two.  This number was then divided by the child’s total vocabulary minus cognates, semi-cognates, and non-equivalents.  Importantly, TE pairs (including both cognates and semi-cognates) on each of the CDI forms were identiﬁed by two independent and fully bilingual raters.  These raters then came to an agreement on which words from each form would be selected as pairs.  They also came to a consensus on which TEs would be classiﬁed as cognate or semi-cognate pairs.  Given that both the English and French forms contained a limited number of synonyms, it was decided that children would be given credit for one TE pair, even if they knew synonymous words for the same concept (e. g.  sofa and couch in English and divan and sofa in French).  After completing these calculations, a one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the total proportion of TEs at each wave, and correlations were computed to examine the relation between relative exposure, vocabulary size, and the proportion of TEs across time-points.  In order to investigate the impact of changes in exposure and relative vocabulary size on TE development, a hierarchical regression was also performed to determine the best predictor of change at each wave of data collection.  Given that no major diﬀerences were found between analyses using the total TE proportion and analyses using the proportion of TEs minus cognates and semi-cognates, all reported statistics are taken from analyses using the total proportion of TEs.  However, descriptive data have been included for the proportion of TEs with cognates and semi-cognates subtracted at each wave.  <Conclusion> R E S U L T S A N D D I S C U S S I O N.  At Wave , the proportion of TEs was calculated using data from the CDI.  WG.  The mean proportion of TEs in bilinguals’ expressive vocabulary at .  was % (with cognates and semi-cognates removed M = %).  At Waves  and , however, the proportion of TEs was calculated using results from the CDI.  WS.  The mean proportion of TEs in bilinguals’ expressive vocabulary at Wave  of data collection was % (with cognates and semi-cognates removed M = %), with it notably increasing to % (with cognates and semi-cognates removed M = %) by Wave  (see Table  and Figures  & ).  Importantly, bilinguals acquired as many new TEs from Wave  to Wave  as they did from Wave  to Wave , when considering both the total proportion of TEs at each wave, as well as the proportion of new TEs acquired across waves (i. e.  new TEs divided by new words added to children’s vocabulary across each -month period).  Importantly, children signiﬁcantly increased the proportion of TEs in their vocabularies by % between .  and .  (F(,) = ·, p = ·), with the proportion of TEs that infants acquired at Wave  being positively correlated with the same proportion of TEs measured at Wave  and at Wave  (see Table ).  This suggests that there is stability in the proportion of TEs and their rate of acquisition in children’s vocabularies.  Factors inﬂuencing TE acquisition in young bilinguals.  In order to examine the extent to which language exposure ratios impact TE acquisition in our sample of young bilinguals, ratios for vocabulary size and language exposure were calculated by dividing L raw scores by L raw scores for each variable (Hurtado et al. , ).  Log transformations were then applied to these ratios (with smaller values being associated with more balanced exposure and vocabulary size), and bivariate correlations were run using these relative measures (see Table ).  Importantly, and as expected, relative exposure was correlated with relative vocabulary size at Waves  and  of data collection, with a trend toward the same result at Wave .  Relative exposure also tended to be correlated across waves, with a trend toward the same result for relative vocabulary.  This suggests moderate stability in both relative language exposure and vocabulary size over time.  More importantly, both relative exposure and relative vocabulary size were correlated with the total proportion of TEs in children’s vocabularies at Waves  and , such that children with more balanced ratios of exposure and vocabulary exhibited a greater proportion of TEs in their vocabulary.  Although these results did not reach signiﬁcance at Wave , the correlations were in the expected direction.  Because children were only beginning to develop their productive vocabularies at this stage of development, and several children had not yet acquired TEs in their vocabularies, it is possible that there simply was not enough variability in the data to produce strong correlations at this wave.  In order to assess the impact of changes in relative exposure and vocabulary size on change in the proportion of TEs across waves, two regression analyses were conducted, one each for TE development from .  to .  and from .  to . .  The ﬁrst examined the predictive ability of changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size on TE development between .  and . .  Importantly, change in relative vocabulary size accounted for % of the variance in change across waves, and emerged as the best predictor in the model.  Children who exhibited more balanced rates of vocabulary growth (i. e.  adding approximately as many new words in L as they did in L across waves) accumulated more new TEs across waves (ΔF(,) = ·, p = ·.  see Table ).  The second regression examined the predictive ability of changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size on TE development between .  and . .  The results once again indicated that changes in the ratio of L. L vocabulary size best predicted change in the proportion of TEs across waves, such that children who exhibited more balanced rates of acquisition accumulated more new TEs (ΔF(,) = ·, p < ·).  Change in relative vocabulary size accounted for an additional % of the variance in TE acquisition across waves above and beyond change in relative exposure.  Importantly, change in language exposure accounted for only % of the variance in TE development from Wave  to Wave , and % of the variance from Wave  to Wave .
