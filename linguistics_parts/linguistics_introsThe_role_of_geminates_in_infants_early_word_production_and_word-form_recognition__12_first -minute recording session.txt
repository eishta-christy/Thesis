Introduction.  Children’s first word forms have been found to be very similar across languages, with minor ambient language effects (Boysson-Bardies & Vihman, .  Vihman, Kay, Boysson-Bardies, Durand & Sundberg, ).  This similarity in production can be ascribed to infants’ limited articulatory skills (Davis & MacNeilage, ) and experience (Vihman, ).  As children move into regular word production, however, cross-linguistic differences are observed (Stoel-Gammon, Williams & Buder, .  Buder & Stoel-Gammon, .  Vihman, , ).  One early-emerging difference, for example, is the production of long consonants or, where consonantal length plays a phonologically contrastive role, GEMINATES (which nevertheless need not be in any sense contrastive for the children).  Because child production is relatively slow or sluggish (Smith, .  Payne, Post, Astruc, Prieto & Vanrell, ), long medial consonants can readily be heard (and measured) in the first words, even in the case of children exposed only to languages like English or French, where they are not contrastive and in fact rarely occur at all (Vihman & Velleman, ).  To illustrate this, analysis of the word forms produced by five children each at the time of first word use (termed the -WORD POINT [wp].  the first -minute recording session in which at least four different spontaneously produced words can be identified.  mean age .
