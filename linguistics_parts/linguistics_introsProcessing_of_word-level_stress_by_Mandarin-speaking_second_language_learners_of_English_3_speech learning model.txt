The ﬁrst language (L1) is often claimed to be responsible for second language (L2) learners’ (in)ability to process particular sounds in the target language.  However, the conditions under which the L1 facilitates or inhibits the learning of new sounds are unclear, especially in the suprasegmental domain.  Theoretical models such as Flege’s (1995) speech learning model and Best’s (1995) perceptual assimilation model predict L2 learners’ performance based on the phonetic similarity between L1 and L2 sounds.  However, most of the evidence in support of these (and other) L2 speech perception models comes from studies that focus on consonants (e.
