A central assumption of most models of reading acquisition is that children start out by decoding words on a letter-by-letter basis at ﬁrst (Ehri, 1995.  Grainger & Ziegler, 2011.  Seymour, 2005.  Share, 1995).  They learn grapheme–phoneme correspondence (GPC) mappings and sound out words.  As their reading skills develop and they gain more experience with written words, it is assumed that they become sensitive to intermediate-sized units until they are ﬁnally able to decode whole words directly “on sight.
