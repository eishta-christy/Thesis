I N T R O D U C T I O N.  In order to recognize spoken words, children must harbor a very precise set of expectations about the relationship between sound and meaning.  Formulating this set of expectations is complicated by the inordinate variability intrinsic to human speech.  Learners must learn from experience how to assign appropriate relevance to the full range of variation in speech, gradually converging upon a phonological system that is closely aligned with the structure of the native lexicon.  Phonological specification within the developing lexicon has been extensively studied in Romance and Germanic languages, such as English, Spanish, and French (e. g.  Mani & Plunkett, .  Nazzi, .  Swingley & Aslin, , .  White & Morgan, ).  In contrast, such investigations remain a relative rarity in tone languages, yet tone languages comprise the linguistic majority.  They are widely spoken around the world and are more frequent than non-tone (or intonation) languages (Fromkin, .  Yip, ).  Moreover, over half of the world’s population speak a native tone language (Fromkin, ), yet empirical studies of language acquisition focus predominantly on native learners of intonation languages.  A by-product of a disproportionately weighty focus on languages such as English for understanding of the phonological lexicon is that effects of vowels and consonants on word recognition have been widely researched.  In contrast, our understanding of the consequences of tone variation on word recognition remains limited.  The purpose of the current study is to investigate the specificity of phonological representations for tones by exploring children’s responses to different types of lexical tone variation in spoken word recognition.  Tone languages are defined by tripartite phonological systems, which draw distinctions in word meaning by varying three levels of the phonological code.  consonants, vowels, and lexical tone.  The last source of variation, lexical tone, entails syllable-level shifts in fundamental frequency (or in its perceptual correspondent, vocal pitch), amplitude, and duration (Blicher, Diehl & Cohen, .  Edmondson & Esling, .  Leather, .  Liu & Samuel, .  Whalen & Xu, .  Wong & Diehl, ).  The most widely spoken tone language, Mandarin Chinese, has four lexical tones.  Tone  (high level tone), Tone  (rising tone), Tone  (dipping tone), and Tone  (falling tone) (see Figure  for a depiction of Mandarin Chinese tones).  Each tone communicates word meaning in conjunction with vowels and consonants.  For example, the word ma assumes different meanings based on the tone in which it is produced.  Ma means ‘mother’ when spoken in Tone , ‘hemp’ when spoken in Tone , ‘horse’ when spoken in Tone , and ‘to scold’ when said in Tone .  Learners of a tone language therefore have to simultaneously track meaningful variation in vowels, consonants, and tones to arrive at the phonological determinants of meaning.  Traditionally, in experimental research, children’s abilities to track phonological determinants of meaning were studied by investigating the accuracy and efficiency with which they recognized spoken words.  More specifically, measuring children’s sensitivity to words that deviate from their correct form via a phonological substitution (e. g.  fixation to an image of a cup upon hearing tup versus cup) have provided us with a powerful means with which to scrutinize the early phonological lexicon and the level of specificity therein.  Studies in this area, notably mispronunciation studies, have contributed significantly to our understanding of the degree of phonological definition associated with the nascent lexicon.  These investigations have also revealed some of the constraints on children’s sensitivity to mispronunciations, reporting moderating effects of the particular task employed (e. g.  preferential looking versus categorization tasks), the specific contrast used, the extent of deviation from the correct pronunciation, and of the age at which children are tested (e. g.  Curtin, Fennell & Escudero, .  Havy, Bertoncini & Nazzi, .  Mani, Coleman & Plunkett, .  Mani & Plunkett, , .  Singh, Goh & Wewalaarachchi, .  Swingley & Aslin, , .  Van der Feest, .  White&Morgan, ).  For the most part, mispronunciation studies have focused on manipulating vowels and consonants within familiar words and comparing children’s responses to correct and mispronounced words.  A much more marginal emphasis has been placed on researching how learners of tone languages represent lexical tones in their early lexicon.
