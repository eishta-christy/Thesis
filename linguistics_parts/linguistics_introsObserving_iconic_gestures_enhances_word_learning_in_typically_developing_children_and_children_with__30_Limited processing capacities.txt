I N T R O D U C T I O N.  Human communication is multimodal, including gestures.  Gestures are visible actions of body parts (Kendon, ) and constitute a crucial part of conversation.  Co-speech gestures accompany spoken speech.  They contribute to felicitous communication by facilitating listeners’ comprehension of a spoken message (Beattie & Shovelton, .  Hostetter, .  Kendon, ) and help speakers retrieve information stored in the mental lexicon (Frick-Horbury & Guttentag, .  Krauss, Chen & Gottesman, .  Ruiter, ).  The close relationship between gesture and speech and their mutual influence are widely recognized.  Accounts of embodied cognition assume that motor actions, such as observing a speaker gesturing, enhance memory and learning (Madan & Singhal, ).  Gestures are classified into different types.  Here, we focus on iconic hand gestures, which capture meaning aspects of the entity that is conveyed by the gesture (McNeill, ), for example flapping hands representing a bird flying.  Iconic gestures have been suggested to facilitate word learning.  It is argued that iconic gestures are less arbitrary than most spoken symbols.  The visuospatial aspects of gesture help process the accompanying speech and lead to strengthened memory traces and deeper conceptual understanding (Hostetter, .  So, Chen-Hui & Wei-Shan, ).  A comprehensive review of the existing literature (Hostetter, ) proposed that gestures are particularly helpful to children.  The focus of the present study is on word learning in typically developing (TD) children and in children with specific language impairment (SLI).  Previous research indicated a gesture advantage in children with SLI as compared to their TD peers such that they show stronger associations between gesture and language (Botting, Riches, Gaynor & Morgan, ), and benefit more from gesture input for pragmatic comprehension (Kirk, Pine & Ryder, .  Lavelli, Barachetti & Florit, ).  So far, this has not been demonstrated for word learning.  Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the influence of gestures on word learning in typically developing and language impaired populations.  Word learning in children with SLI.  SLI is defined as a developmental language disorder in the absence of any identifiable reason for the disorder (Bishop, .  Leonard, ).  It is generally agreed that the population is heterogeneous and that children with SLI show various deficits in language, including slow acquisition of the lexicon and grammar, and limited comprehension and production of vocabulary or grammatical forms (Bishop & Snowling, .  Conti-Ramsden & Botting, .  Leonard, ).  Limited processing capacities and difficulty with sustained attention are reported as well (Alt, Myers & Alt, .  Ebert & Kohnert, .
