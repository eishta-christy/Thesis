An important topic in psycholinguistic research is the nature of sentence representations during language comprehension.  Information from several sources is used to yield an interpretation of a sentence.  Syntactic processing is usually considered an essential step, as the comprehender has to build a syntactic structure according to the morphosyntactic rules of a language.  Traditional theories assume that language processing is based on complete and detailed representations of the input.  In addition to syntactic algorithms, sentence comprehension may be driven by nonsyntactic constraints and simple processing heuristics.  The good-enough approach to language comprehension assumes that the comprehender has access to two processing routes.
