I N T R O D U C T I O N.  Children’s interpretation of contrast-marking prosody Although many aspects of language have been mastered by the age of five or six, other aspects, such as pragmatic understanding of the meaning of intonational contours, have longer developmental trajectories.  Many researchers have argued that young children do not rely on intonation in inferring the speaker’s pragmatic intention, affect, or emotional state (e. g.  Aguert, Laval, Le Bigot & Bernicot, .  Capelli, Nakagawa & Madden, .  Cruttenden, .  Cutler & Swinney, .  Hornby & Hass, .  Morton & Trehub, .  Quam & Swingley, .  Solan, .  Van Der Meulen, Janssen & Den Os, .  Wells, Peppe & Goulandris, .  Winner & Leekam, ).  Moreover, the ability to interpret an intonation contour that signals contrast is said to develop late, after age six, and slowly (Ito, Bibyk, Wagner & Speer, .  Ito, Jincho, Minai, Yamane & Mazuka, .  Speer & Ito, ).  For example, Cruttenden () tested British English-speaking ten-year-olds and adults to determine whether they could reliably identify the referents of utterances such as those in (a) and (b), given a choice of three pictured referents []–[].  () a.  It’s a very nice garden.  [fall–rise] b.  It’s a very nice garden. a nice garden but a house falling down a garden and a house, both very nice a garden overgrown but a very nice house (a) has the fall–rise pitch accent on the word garden, which results in a slight rise at the final position of the sentence.  This is typically associated with reservation (Cruttenden’s [] term) or contrast in meaning.
