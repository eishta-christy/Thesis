I N T R O D U C T I O N.  Human communication is multimodal, including gestures.  Gestures are visible actions of body parts (Kendon, ) and constitute a crucial part of conversation.  Co-speech gestures accompany spoken speech.  They contribute to felicitous communication by facilitating listeners’ comprehension of a spoken message (Beattie & Shovelton, .  Hostetter, .  Kendon, ) and help speakers retrieve information stored in the mental lexicon (Frick-Horbury & Guttentag, .  Krauss, Chen & Gottesman, .  Ruiter, ).  The close relationship between gesture and speech and their mutual influence are widely recognized.  Accounts of embodied cognition assume that motor actions, such as observing a speaker gesturing, enhance memory and learning (Madan & Singhal, ).  Gestures are classified into different types.  Here, we focus on iconic hand gestures, which capture meaning aspects of the entity that is conveyed by the gesture (McNeill, ), for example flapping hands representing a bird flying.  Iconic gestures have been suggested to facilitate word learning.
