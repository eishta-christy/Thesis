I N T R O D U C T I O N.  Distinguishing between declaratives and interrogatives is an important ability for language users.  In English and many other languages, interrogatives generally involve syntactic structures and word order patterns that are different from declaratives.  For example, in English the canonical ordering in simple transitive declarative sentences is subject– verb–object (Slobin & Bever, ), as in Anna likes chocolate.  However, this ordering is disrupted in the associated polar interrogative, which inverts the subject and auxiliary verb, and inserts an utterance-initial do, since no auxiliary is present.  Thus, Anna likes chocolate becomes Does Anna like chocolate.  Moreover, in so-called wh-questions, a grammatical phrase that normally occurs in the declarative form is absent, and its content is queried by a wh-word – e. g.  who, what, where, how, etc.  – that occurs at the beginning of the sentence (Whatt does Anna like ti. ).  (The t stands for ‘trace’, and represents the structural location of the constituent that is related to the wh-word that shares its index – in this case, the direct object of like. ) Similar kinds of word order variations occur in many other (primarily Indo-European) languages (e. g.
