I N T R O D U C T I O N.  Human communication relies on the ability to track beliefs and other epistemic states, since hearers try to infer the speaker’s intentions during conversation (Grice, ).  The ability to consult epistemic states during communication has been argued to be present early in life.  infants take into account a speaker’s knowledge when ﬁxing reference for novel expressions (Baldwin, .  Bloom, .  Koenig & Echols, ), and exclude as potential referents for novel labels objects that they already have names for (Diesendruck & Markson, ).  Other studies show that children trust knowledgeable over uninformed speakers when acquiring novel labels.  when a speaker explicitly claimed ignorance about the correct referent of a novel word (e. g.  “I don’t know what a blicket is.  Maybe it’s this one. ”), three- and four-year-olds did not learn the word (Sabbagh & Baldwin, ).  In another study, four-year-olds, and in some cases three-year-olds, preferred to learn a novel label from a previously reliable speaker than from one who claimed ignorance of the names of familiar objects or who labeled them incorrectly (Koenig & Harris, .  cf.  also Birch, Vauthier & Bloom, .  Jaswal & Neely, ).  Nevertheless, whether (and how early) preschoolers track their interlocutors’ mental states is still a matter of debate.  For instance, some commentators have suggested that young children’s ability to match previously unlabeled referents to novel words does not require the use of pragmatic reasoning, since this ability is present in autistic populations who have deficits in social cognition (de Marchena, Eigsti, Worek, Ono & Snedeker, .  see also Breheny, ).  Other work has questioned whether older children and even adults successfully adopt the perspective of their interlocutors during referential communication (Epley, Morewedge & Keysar, .  but see Nadig & Sedivy, ).  Moreover, several studies have shown that five-year-olds have difficulties with pragmatic inferences that rely on calculations of how informative a speaker should be based on her knowledge and the conversational needs (Noveck, .  Papafragou & Musolino, .  Huang & Snedeker, .  among others).  A particularly stringent and straightforward test for preschoolers’ ability to consult others’ belief states during communication is to ask whether children can adjust their expectations about the speaker’s referential intent when learning a word from a speaker with a false belief.  False belief paradigms have been used extensively in the developmental literature to study sensitivity to others’ epistemic states in non-communicative contexts (i. e.  contexts that involve understanding and predicting someone’s actions.  see Wimmer & Perner, .  Baron-Cohen, Leslie & Frith, ).  Several studies have adopted these paradigms to ask whether young children can reason about a communicator’s referential intent even in circumstances in which the communicator holds a false belief – but results have been somewhat mixed.  In the ﬁrst study of this kind, Happé and Loth () gave three- to four-year-old children a false belief Word Learning task (adapted from Baldwin, ).  In this task, a puppet called Mary put a novel object in a box, closed the lid, and left the scene.  Another puppet called Tom entered, removed Mary’s object from the box, and put another novel object in.  Mary returned to the scene, picked up the closed box and named the contents (“Do you want to see the modi.  There’s a modi in this box! Let’s see the modi!”).  Next, children were presented with the two novel objects and were asked to indicate which one was the modi.  Results indicated that % of the children who had previously succeeded in control questions passed that task.  However, because of the way the data are reported, the precise ages of the passers and any developmental diﬀerences between three- and four-year-olds cannot be ascertained from this study.  Furthermore, other studies suggest that preschoolers’ ability to adjust word learning when the speaker has a false belief may be more limited.  Carpenter, Call, and Tomasello (, Exp.  ) gave children around their third birthday a Word Learning task similar to the one used by Happé and Loth, except that the original object was removed from its location and not substituted by another novel object.  About % of these children (after taking into account performance on control trials) passed the Word Learning task.  More recent experiments by Houston-Price and colleagues () also lead to higher estimates.  For instance, in one of their experiments (Exp.  ), that was similar to Happé and Loth’s, only about % of three-year-olds and % of four-year-olds passed a false belief Word Learning task.  In sum, existing evidence does not establish ﬁrmly how or when preschoolers develop the ability to use mental states to acquire novel words.  One might assume that a more detailed developmental investigation of the ability to track a speaker’s false beliefs is unnecessary given the wealth of research on the development of false belief attribution in standard (non-communicative) contexts.  This research has shown that the ability to correctly report false beliefs (and hence to accurately reason about objects of belief as distinct from reality) is typically absent in three-year-olds but emerges by the time children are four or ﬁve years of age (see Wellman, Cross & Watson, , for a review.  but cf.  Clements & Perner, .  Garnham & Ruﬀman, .  Onishi & Baillargeon, .  Southgate, Senju & Csibra, .  Surian, Caldi & Sperber, .  Buttelmann, Carpenter & Tomasello, .  Rubio-Fernandez & Geurts, , for evidence of earlier success with simpler tasks).  However, some of the studies mentioned above have raised the possibility that the developmental timetable for understanding epistemic states might diﬀer between word-learning and standard belief-attribution contexts.  Happé and Loth’s () study included a standard false belief Action Prediction task (modiﬁed from Baron-Cohen et al. , ).  Children were shown an act-out story in which a puppet called Sally put her ball in a basket and went out.  Another puppet (‘naughty’ Ann) came in and decided to play a trick on Sally, moving her ball from the basket to a box.  Sally returned and wanted to play with her ball.  Children were asked.  “Where will Sally look for her ball. ” It was found that children were more likely to succeed in tracking false belief in the Word Learning task than in the Action Prediction task.  The authors concluded that understanding thoughts behind words might be easier for children than understanding thoughts behind actions, and took their data as tentative evidence supporting the presence of distinct theory of mind mechanisms supporting action prediction vs.  communication (in accordance with Roth & Leslie, .  Sperber, .  Wilson, ).  Similarly, Carpenter et al.  () reported that their sample of threeyear-olds performed very poorly on the same action prediction task, despite the fact that, as already mentioned, % of these children passed word learning trials.  One issue with these studies is that there were several asymmetries between the types of scenarios used to test false belief in action prediction vs.  communication contexts.  To take a speciﬁc example, in both Happé and Loth () and in Carpenter et al.  (), the Word Learning scenario allowed for a tighter association between the protagonist and the target object compared to the Action Prediction scenario, since, in word learning trials, the protagonist only ever came into physical contact with the original object, and never with the object that was used for its substitution.  In the Carpenter et al. , study, the diﬀerence was even starker because the target object was not substituted by another object but removed from the experimental scene altogether in the Word Learning scenarios.  Thus, when the character who originally hid the object came back and uttered a word for the object while trying to retrieve it, there was no candidate referent in the original location for children to mistakenly label.  This manipulation diﬀers markedly from the set-up of the classic Action Prediction task (see Wimmer & Perner, .  Koos, Gergeley, Csibra & Biro, .  Wellman et al. , ).  There are additional task diﬀerences in the number of objects, hiding locations, and test questions in Happé and Loth ().  Even after removing several such asymmetries between the two types of scenarios, more recent studies with three- and four-year-olds by Houston-Price and colleagues (, Exp.   and ) replicated the advantage of word learning over action prediction false belief scenarios.  Nevertheless, Houston-Price and colleagues () also showed that the advantage of word learning scenarios could be eliminated.  Following Perner, Rendi, and Garnham (), they hypothesized that the Action Prediction questions (“Where will X look for Y. ”) in prior studies and their own initial experiments required greater resistance to a ‘reality bias’ exerted by the actual location of the target object that the protagonist desired compared to the Word Learning questions (“Which one is the modi. ”) that involved a not-yet-established referential link.  Houston-Price et al.  (, Exp.  ) modiﬁed the Action Prediction task used in their previous experiments in a way known to powerfully reduce the ‘reality pull’ (Wimmer & Perner, .  Wellman et al. , ).  in the new version, after the target object was switched by a second character, the character would remove both objects and leave.  As expected, children performed better in this Action Prediction task compared to the earlier version.  furthermore, and crucially, the diﬀerence from the Word Learning task disappeared.  Houston-Price and colleagues concluded that what appeared to be precocious understanding of false belief in the word-learning domain was driven by a weaker ‘reality bias’ inherent in the naming task itself.  At present, a synthesis of existing ﬁndings is complicated.  only one experiment so far has failed to produce the asymmetry in false belief reasoning across domains (Houston-Price et al. , , Exp.  ), and conclusions drawn from that experiment critically depend on whether one accepts the premise that the newly introduced label in the Word Learning task exerts no or little ‘referential pull’.  Notice that this idea is not supported by independent evidence.  In fact, it seems plausible to assume that the Word Learning task still requires the child to override the tendency to interpret the tricked speaker’s sentence (e. g.  “The modi is in this box”) as if it refers to the here-and-now of the situation (as the child currently represents it), and hence to attach the new label for the desired object to the true contents of the box.  On this line of reasoning, simplifying the Action Prediction task by removing the need to inhibit the incorrect response (the single most powerful way to boost children’s ability to pass the false belief task, after the eﬀects of age, according to Wellman et al. ’s () meta-analysis of  studies) created a massive imbalance with respect to the Word Learning task (that still involved inhibition) – hence eliminating the previously observed advantage of the latter task.  The alternative explanation sketched above is compatible with the proposal that understanding false labels develops separately from understanding false beliefs (since it assumes that the difference is simply masked in Houston-Price et al. , , Exp.  ).  It is also compatible with the possibility that task demands – not necessarily related to the weaker ‘reality bias’ in interpreting novel labels – are responsible for the observed false belief advantage in communicative domains.  Notice that, despite efforts to equate task demands across domains, several major differences persisted throughout all studies that have reported the word-learning advantage (see Carpenter et al. , .  Happé & Loth, .  Houston-Price et al. , ).  For instance, false belief reasoning in non-communicative contexts targeted location changes and was assessed through a location question (“Where .  .  .  . ”).  answers were given by pointing within the experimental scene.  and false-belief contents involved familiar objects that belonged to the characters.  By contrast, false belief reasoning in communicative contexts targeted object changes and was assessed through a referent-choice question (“Which one .  .  .  . ”).  answers were given by selecting one of two objects placed in front of the child but outside the experimental scene.  and false belief contents involved novel objects.  One or more of these differences may have made it easier for children to disengage their perspective from their own knowledge for purposes of word learning compared to action prediction.  At this point, since several theoretical options are open, further experimentation is needed to settle the question whether false belief reasoning is easier in communicative compared to non-communicative contexts.  In the present experiment, our primary goal was to explore whether young children track a speaker’s epistemic state (specifically, a false belief) when learning the meaning of a novel word.  We compared three-, four-, and five-year-olds in a simple Label task that drew on Happé and Loth’s () Word Learning scenarios.  In this task, one character placed a novel object into a box and left.  A second character came in and put another novel object inside the box.  The first character then came back and referred to the object in the box using a novel label (“blicket”).  Children were presented with a choice between the two objects and asked.  “Which one is the blicket. ” Of interest was whether children would be able to reliably handle false beliefs in word learning contexts and how this ability would change across ages.  Success on this task would offer strong support for the presence of mind-reading skills in children’s early communication, especially in the face of diverging estimates in the literature (see Carpenter et al.
