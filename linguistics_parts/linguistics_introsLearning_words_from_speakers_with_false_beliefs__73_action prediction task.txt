I N T R O D U C T I O N.  Human communication relies on the ability to track beliefs and other epistemic states, since hearers try to infer the speaker’s intentions during conversation (Grice, ).  The ability to consult epistemic states during communication has been argued to be present early in life.  infants take into account a speaker’s knowledge when ﬁxing reference for novel expressions (Baldwin, .  Bloom, .  Koenig & Echols, ), and exclude as potential referents for novel labels objects that they already have names for (Diesendruck & Markson, ).  Other studies show that children trust knowledgeable over uninformed speakers when acquiring novel labels.  when a speaker explicitly claimed ignorance about the correct referent of a novel word (e. g.  “I don’t know what a blicket is.  Maybe it’s this one. ”), three- and four-year-olds did not learn the word (Sabbagh & Baldwin, ).  In another study, four-year-olds, and in some cases three-year-olds, preferred to learn a novel label from a previously reliable speaker than from one who claimed ignorance of the names of familiar objects or who labeled them incorrectly (Koenig & Harris, .  cf.  also Birch, Vauthier & Bloom, .  Jaswal & Neely, ).  Nevertheless, whether (and how early) preschoolers track their interlocutors’ mental states is still a matter of debate.  For instance, some commentators have suggested that young children’s ability to match previously unlabeled referents to novel words does not require the use of pragmatic reasoning, since this ability is present in autistic populations who have deficits in social cognition (de Marchena, Eigsti, Worek, Ono & Snedeker, .  see also Breheny, ).  Other work has questioned whether older children and even adults successfully adopt the perspective of their interlocutors during referential communication (Epley, Morewedge & Keysar, .  but see Nadig & Sedivy, ).  Moreover, several studies have shown that five-year-olds have difficulties with pragmatic inferences that rely on calculations of how informative a speaker should be based on her knowledge and the conversational needs (Noveck, .  Papafragou & Musolino, .  Huang & Snedeker, .  among others).  A particularly stringent and straightforward test for preschoolers’ ability to consult others’ belief states during communication is to ask whether children can adjust their expectations about the speaker’s referential intent when learning a word from a speaker with a false belief.  False belief paradigms have been used extensively in the developmental literature to study sensitivity to others’ epistemic states in non-communicative contexts (i. e.  contexts that involve understanding and predicting someone’s actions.  see Wimmer & Perner, .  Baron-Cohen, Leslie & Frith, ).  Several studies have adopted these paradigms to ask whether young children can reason about a communicator’s referential intent even in circumstances in which the communicator holds a false belief – but results have been somewhat mixed.  In the ﬁrst study of this kind, Happé and Loth () gave three- to four-year-old children a false belief Word Learning task (adapted from Baldwin, ).  In this task, a puppet called Mary put a novel object in a box, closed the lid, and left the scene.  Another puppet called Tom entered, removed Mary’s object from the box, and put another novel object in.  Mary returned to the scene, picked up the closed box and named the contents (“Do you want to see the modi.  There’s a modi in this box! Let’s see the modi!”).  Next, children were presented with the two novel objects and were asked to indicate which one was the modi.  Results indicated that % of the children who had previously succeeded in control questions passed that task.  However, because of the way the data are reported, the precise ages of the passers and any developmental diﬀerences between three- and four-year-olds cannot be ascertained from this study.  Furthermore, other studies suggest that preschoolers’ ability to adjust word learning when the speaker has a false belief may be more limited.  Carpenter, Call, and Tomasello (, Exp.  ) gave children around their third birthday a Word Learning task similar to the one used by Happé and Loth, except that the original object was removed from its location and not substituted by another novel object.  About % of these children (after taking into account performance on control trials) passed the Word Learning task.  More recent experiments by Houston-Price and colleagues () also lead to higher estimates.  For instance, in one of their experiments (Exp.  ), that was similar to Happé and Loth’s, only about % of three-year-olds and % of four-year-olds passed a false belief Word Learning task.  In sum, existing evidence does not establish ﬁrmly how or when preschoolers develop the ability to use mental states to acquire novel words.  One might assume that a more detailed developmental investigation of the ability to track a speaker’s false beliefs is unnecessary given the wealth of research on the development of false belief attribution in standard (non-communicative) contexts.  This research has shown that the ability to correctly report false beliefs (and hence to accurately reason about objects of belief as distinct from reality) is typically absent in three-year-olds but emerges by the time children are four or ﬁve years of age (see Wellman, Cross & Watson, , for a review.  but cf.  Clements & Perner, .  Garnham & Ruﬀman, .  Onishi & Baillargeon, .  Southgate, Senju & Csibra, .  Surian, Caldi & Sperber, .  Buttelmann, Carpenter & Tomasello, .  Rubio-Fernandez & Geurts, , for evidence of earlier success with simpler tasks).  However, some of the studies mentioned above have raised the possibility that the developmental timetable for understanding epistemic states might diﬀer between word-learning and standard belief-attribution contexts.  Happé and Loth’s () study included a standard false belief Action Prediction task (modiﬁed from Baron-Cohen et al. , ).  Children were shown an act-out story in which a puppet called Sally put her ball in a basket and went out.  Another puppet (‘naughty’ Ann) came in and decided to play a trick on Sally, moving her ball from the basket to a box.  Sally returned and wanted to play with her ball.  Children were asked.  “Where will Sally look for her ball. ” It was found that children were more likely to succeed in tracking false belief in the Word Learning task than in the Action Prediction task.  The authors concluded that understanding thoughts behind words might be easier for children than understanding thoughts behind actions, and took their data as tentative evidence supporting the presence of distinct theory of mind mechanisms supporting action prediction vs.  communication (in accordance with Roth & Leslie, .  Sperber, .  Wilson, ).  Similarly, Carpenter et al.  () reported that their sample of threeyear-olds performed very poorly on the same action prediction task, despite the fact that, as already mentioned, % of these children passed word learning trials.  One issue with these studies is that there were several asymmetries between the types of scenarios used to test false belief in action prediction vs.
