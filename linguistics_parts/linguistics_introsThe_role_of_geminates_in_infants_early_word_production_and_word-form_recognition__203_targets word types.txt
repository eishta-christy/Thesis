Introduction.  Children’s first word forms have been found to be very similar across languages, with minor ambient language effects (Boysson-Bardies & Vihman, .  Vihman, Kay, Boysson-Bardies, Durand & Sundberg, ).  This similarity in production can be ascribed to infants’ limited articulatory skills (Davis & MacNeilage, ) and experience (Vihman, ).  As children move into regular word production, however, cross-linguistic differences are observed (Stoel-Gammon, Williams & Buder, .  Buder & Stoel-Gammon, .  Vihman, , ).  One early-emerging difference, for example, is the production of long consonants or, where consonantal length plays a phonologically contrastive role, GEMINATES (which nevertheless need not be in any sense contrastive for the children).  Because child production is relatively slow or sluggish (Smith, .  Payne, Post, Astruc, Prieto & Vanrell, ), long medial consonants can readily be heard (and measured) in the first words, even in the case of children exposed only to languages like English or French, where they are not contrastive and in fact rarely occur at all (Vihman & Velleman, ).  To illustrate this, analysis of the word forms produced by five children each at the time of first word use (termed the -WORD POINT [wp].  the first -minute recording session in which at least four different spontaneously produced words can be identified.  mean age . · for the American and French infants, .  for the Finnish infants) revealed a mean consonant length for English of  ms (s. d.  ·), for French,  ms (s. d.  ·), and for Finnish, with its contrastive consonant length,  ms (s. d.  ) (Vihman & Velleman, ).  As the children gain production skills and productive lexical knowledge of their language, however, the duration of medial consonants drops significantly in languages with no phonological contrast in consonant length.  Thus, at the end of the single-word period (-WORD POINT [wp].  mean age .  for the American infants, .  for the French, .  for the Finnish), the mean medial-consonant duration for the same five children learning English was  ms and for those learning French,  ms, with a drop in variability within each group as well (s. d.  for English, ·, for French, ·).  at the same time, medial consonants became longer and intra-group variability increased for the five Finnish children (mean  ms, s. d.  ·).  In fact, in languages with geminates the use and overuse of these long consonants (i. e.  their production even for singleton targets) is consistently reported for the single-word period (see, for Arabic.  Khattab & Al-Tamimi, .  for Estonian.  Vihman, .  for Finnish.  Kunnari, .  Savinainen-Makkonen, a, b, , .  for Hindi.  Bhaya Nair, .  for Italian.  Keren-Portnoy, Majorano & Vihman, .  Majorano, Rainieri & Corsano .  and for Japanese.  Kunnari, Nakai & Vihman, .  Ota, ).  Finally, children learning Welsh, with its (phonetic) accentual lengthening of consonants, also make heavy use of long medial consonants in their early words (Vihman, Nakai & DePaolis, ), although no significant increase in mean medial consonant duration is seen in this case over the period of single word use (Vihman & Kunnari, ), presumably because long consonants are not lexically contrastive in Welsh.  That is, where consonant duration is a (non-contrastive) concomitant of the accentual pattern, its frequency of occurrence may be variable but should be consistently so over time and development.  Where it is lexically tied, infants’ increasing lexical knowledge results in a steady increase in representations of words with geminates.  Thus, contrastive child use, as seen in Finnish, appears to be mediated by lexical advance.  Examples of early words produced with long medial consonants in Arabic, Estonian, Finnish, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, and Welsh are presented in Table , where SELECTED (or more or less accurately produced words) have a long consonant in the adult target as well as in the child form, whereas ADAPTED words (modified to fit one of the child’s favored production patterns) display ‘overuse’ of geminates.  Here we observe that in their production of long consonants children may replace a VV sequence by CC (see both Martin’s word form for Arabic ba. ba and Kaia’s form for Estonian auto), omit the onset consonant (as in Joel’s word for Finnish loppu.  cf.  also the Hindi and Japanese examples), ‘demote’ an onset consonant (replacing a supraglottal by a glottal segment.  Fflur, Welsh example), or retain the length feature while changing the segmental quality (and word length) to fit a consonant-harmony constraint (as in Anna’s word for Italian cavallo).  Interestingly, in most of these languages child overuse of the prosodic word shape <VCCV> can be observed (as in the examples from Joel, V, Haruo, and Fflur.  Table ), even when the adult target form includes an early-learned onset consonant such as a labial or coronal stop and the word is accentually trochaic (strong–weak accent), so that the omitted initial consonant is part of the accented syllable.  In fact, Vihman and Velleman () report that % of the tokens produced by five Finnish children at the wp were of the shape <VCCV>.  Savinainen-Makkonen (), similarly, reports use of <VC(C)V> as an idiosyncratic child pattern or TEMPLATE in both selected and adapted words in her case study of the Finnish child Joel.  anna ‘give’ [ɑn. ɑ], vettä ‘water’ [et. æ], tippu ‘fell’ [ip. o], lusikas ‘spoon’ [uki], nammi ‘candy/yummy’ [ɑmi], [mɑmi], [mɑm. i], nostaa ‘carry’ [ot. ɑ. ] (cf.  also Savinainen-Makkonen, b).  The frequent occurrence of the <VC(C)V> pattern in Finnish child forms is all the more striking since the corresponding pattern – VCV, with omitted onset consonant – is rare in the early word forms of children learning (primarily trochaic) English (Savinainen-Makkonen, b.  Vihman & Croft, ), although not in those of children learning final-syllableaccented French (Wauquier & Yamaguchi, ) or primarily iambic (weak–strong) Hebrew (Keren-Portnoy & Segal, in press).  This suggests that, in addition to the ease of articulation of geminates (due to the slow rate of early speech production), their greater segmental duration may make them particularly salient to children, which in turn might draw attention away from the onset consonant, as suggested by SavinainenMakkonen (b).  This would be in accord with the WHOLE-WORD PHONOLOGY account, which argues that children’s early words reflect child memory for the word as a whole, with production of certain salient elements, such as the accented syllable, at the expense of other aspects (Vihman, Nakai, DePaolis & Hallé, .  Vihman & Croft, ).  The whole-word phonology model (Vihman & Keren-Portnoy, a) provides a usage- and exemplar-based perspective on phonological development that contrasts with linear, stage-like approaches that depend on Universal Grammar and parameter setting or markedness-constraint ranking to account for knowledge of linguistic structure (e. g.  Kager, Pater & Zonneveld, .  Demuth, Culbertson & Alter, ).  According to the whole-word phonology model, initial item learning, which targets ‘easy’ words and involves relatively accurate production, is followed by implicit ‘secondary’ distributional learning of the patterns inherent in the child’s own first word forms (see Vihman, , Ch.  ).  In other words, once the child has produced a small collection of different words, she begins to implicitly pick up on the patterns inherent in those words, which reflect both the ambient language structures and the child’s own starting point, commonly rooted in babbling experience (e. g.  Vihman, Macken, Miller, Simmons & Miller, ).  Implicit learning of patterns that become salient through a child’s own production experience typically leads to a regression in accuracy (and so to a non-linear developmental path).  Regression in accuracy is the result of the child generalizing the structural patterns inherent in the word forms they are using.  The resultant patterns appear to constitute (unconscious or implicit) child responses to the phonological challenges posed by target word forms.  In other words, the child’s existing resources (familiar production routines) are deployed to deal with what is novel and thus difficult to bring to mind, plan, and produce as needed (Vihman & Keren-Portnoy, b, p.  ).  At the same time, when children learn languages like Arabic or Finnish, which contrast long and short (geminate and singleton) consonants, expressive lexical advance must play a key role in the acquisition of the structural contrast in medial consonant duration.  In this study we test Savinainen-Makkonen’s hypothesis regarding the salience of geminates and the effect of that salience on the shape of early word forms by analyzing data from the acquisition of Italian, through both observational production and experimental perception studies.  We focus on three research questions.  .  Will the frequency of occurrence of geminates in words used in child-directed speech be mirrored or accentuated in child selection of words to attempt or in their early word forms.  .  Do Italian children tend to omit word-initial consonants particularly in words with medial geminates.  .  Will perception experiments provide corroborating evidence of an effect of medial geminates on children’s attention to the word-initial consonant.  If so, this may be interpreted as evidence in favor of whole-word phonology, inasmuch as a segmental feature occurring later in the word is seen to affect infant processing of the beginning of theWe begin by considering the effect of geminates on child production in a study of thirty children seen with their parents for two recording sessions, at .  and .  (Study ).  We then test the last research question directly in three experiments involving untrained word-form recognition in -month-olds (Study ).  <Middle> STUDY .  GEMINATES IN ITALIAN CHILDREN’S WORD PRODUCTION To gain an idea of the role of geminates in Italian children’s early word production we analyzed the words produced in two recording sessions by thirty children aged .  at the first session, .  at the second.  We also considered the proportion of geminates in the words attempted by these children (target words) and in the child-directed speech of their mothers in the same two sessions.  Finally, we examined the differential application of a <VC(C)V> template in the child word forms to targets with medial singletons vs.  geminates. Participants Thirty-six families were recruited through a letter given to parents of children attending municipal nurseries.  Six children were later excluded because of missing data or because they failed to produce any words.  In the final sample of thirty infants ( males), nineteen (%) were first-born, nine had one sibling, two had two.  All came from monolingual Italian families.  none had health issues or developmental disabilities.  The mothers’ mean age was  years, the fathers’, .  Sixteen mothers and fourteen fathers held university degrees.  Parents gave informed consent for their children to participate in the study.  At the first observation the children were aged . ·, on average (range . ·–. ·), and at the second, . · (range . ·–. ·).  Note that this was a longitudinal study, but with just two sessions, based on child age.  it cannot usefully be compared with age-ranges at wp and wp in the English, French, and Finnish children mentioned earlier.  (For the range of word types produced by the Italian children in the transcribed recordings of the -minute sessions, see Table b. ) Procedure Each infant was observed for  minutes in each of two sessions at the observation laboratory, Department of Psychology, University of Parma.  both parents were present in all cases.  The ALB protocol (Assessing Linguistic Behaviour.  Olswang, Stoel-Gammon, Coggins & Carpenter, ) was followed.  In each session four different sets of toys were presented, one at a time and in a set order, to elicit as large a sample as possible of words used spontaneously.  farm set, ‘nurturing’ set (doll with bed and telephone), ‘food’ set (plastic fruit and vegetables, dishes, and cutlery), and cars and tractors.  The parents were instructed to play with the children as at home but to try to maintain the children’s attention on the toys.  Transcription, words analyzed and reliability.  The sessions were recorded on video in a lab with four cameras (split video) and one microphone in the environment and another on the child.  The experimenter broadly transcribed each child’s vocal and verbal production, noting contextual elements (e. g.  child interaction with objects, communicative gestures and gaze direction, and parental verbal production immediately preceding and following that of the children).  Each completed session was transcribed using CHAT (Codes for the Human Analysis of Transcripts.  MacWhinney, ).  Note that in the analyses that follow we report only CONTENT WORD types (and tokens) for the children as well as the mothers.  Italian function words (e. g.  articles, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions) include few if any geminates and are still relatively rare in the children’s production at the ages we observed.  Onomatopoeia, which rarely, if ever, includes geminates in Italian and whose adult form is often variable were excluded from all of our analyses.  Point-to-point agreement between the two transcribers on segmental identity, based on about % of each transcript, was ·.  Agreement on length of medial consonants in the child forms, based on % of the child forms, was · at . , · at . .  Coding.  Words were identified following the procedures outlined in Vihman and McCune (), with only SPONTANEOUSLY PRODUCED WORDS included.  For the analysis into templates we identified repeatedly used prosodic structures, following Vihman (), focusing particularly on child ‘overuse’ or generalization of structures and distinguishing between selected and adapted words (Vihman & Velleman, ).  A word is considered to be selected, or relatively accurate, if it is produced correctly within the limits of the child’s phonetic inventory (e. g.  it counts as accurate in spite of consonant cluster or coda reduction or omission of /r/ or /s/, for example, if the child is not yet producing those sounds or structures).  a word is considered to be adapted if it is modified with respect to the target, especially its prosodic structure.  Child-directed speech (CDS).  In order to obtain an estimate of geminate use in Italian input speech we analyzed the content words produced by the mothers of the thirty children in each recorded session. Table a shows the range, mean, and standard deviation of content words (both types and tokens) that the thirty mothers addressed to their children in each recording session.  In addition, it shows the number and proportion of content words with geminates (in both types and tokens).  Here we see that, in terms of either types or tokens, about one-third of the words the mothers produced in both sessions had geminates (see numbers in bold face).  In all of the analyses the mothers are also quite similar to one another in their use of geminates, as is evident from the low standard deviation on proportion of geminates (also in bold).  Table b provides the range, mean, and standard deviation of content words the children attempted overall (or of TYPES produced, which is the same thing) at .  and . , while Table c provides the same information in relation to the tokens produced at each session.  In addition, Table b shows the range, mean, and standard deviation of the target words attempted that had geminates at each age and the PROPORTION of target words attempted that had geminates.  it also shows the range, mean, and standard deviation of word types PRODUCED with geminates at each age and the PROPORTION of types produced with geminates, while Table c gives the same information in relation to tokens.  In these tables we see that at . , when most of the children are just beginning to produce words, the proportion of geminates is highly variable (shows a high standard deviation.  in bold face) as regards both target words attempted (·) and actual child forms produced (in terms of either types –· – or tokens –·) as compared with both CDS (· and ·, respectively, at the earlier session) and child words attempted (·) and produced (in either types –· – or tokens –·) at . .  The overall figures for the children’s production (about half include geminates, at both ages and in terms of either types or tokens) correspond closely with findings based on the Italian Communicative Development Inventory (CDI.  Caselli & Casadio, .  Rinaldi, Barca & Burani, ), in which  of the  words most widely reported at .  have medial geminates.  The key point to be gleaned from these tables is that geminate words attract disproportionate child attention and production.  the children attempt and produce a higher proportion of words with geminates than the mothers present them with in their CDS.  To test the significance of these differences we conducted a repeated-measures  ×  ANOVA (dependent variable.  proportion of geminates in TYPES.  within-subject factors.  age, with two levels, .  and . , and words, with three levels, proportion of word types containing geminates in CDS, proportion of targets, and proportion of child forms).  The analysis showed no main effect for age (F[,] = ·.  p = ·, η = ·), a significant effect for words (F[,] = ·.  p < ·, η = ·), and an interaction of age × words (F[,] = ·.  p = ·, η = ·).  Post-hoc analyses indicated that at both .  (p < ·) and .  (p < ·) both the targets and the word forms children produced had (proportionately) significantly more geminates than were used in CDS word types.  Furthermore, at .  the child forms included a higher proportion of geminates than did the targets (p < ·).  We also conducted a repeated-measures  ×  ANOVA with proportion of geminates in TOKENS instead of types as our dependent variable and with two within-subject factors, each of them with two levels (age.  .  and . , and words.  proportion of word tokens containing geminates in CDS and in child forms).  There was no effect for age (F[,] = ·, p = ·, η = ·) and no interaction (F[,] = ·, p = ·, η = ·).  However, there was a highly significant effect for words (F[,] = ·, p < ·, η = ·).  Post-hoc analysis indicates that at both ages the child tokens included a significantly higher proportion of geminates than are seen in CDS word tokens (p < ·).  To test whether there is an effect of individual mothers’ CDS on their children’s production of geminates we examined the results by dyad, as regards words attempted (targets), word types, and word tokens produced by the children in relation to both types and tokens produced by the mothers.  We found no significant correlations when raw numbers were compared.
