I N T R O D U C T I O N.  Human communication is multimodal, including gestures.  Gestures are visible actions of body parts (Kendon, ) and constitute a crucial part of conversation.  Co-speech gestures accompany spoken speech.  They contribute to felicitous communication by facilitating listeners’ comprehension of a spoken message (Beattie & Shovelton, .  Hostetter, .  Kendon, ) and help speakers retrieve information stored in the mental lexicon (Frick-Horbury & Guttentag, .  Krauss, Chen & Gottesman, .  Ruiter, ).  The close relationship between gesture and speech and their mutual influence are widely recognized.  Accounts of embodied cognition assume that motor actions, such as observing a speaker gesturing, enhance memory and learning (Madan & Singhal, ).  Gestures are classified into different types.  Here, we focus on iconic hand gestures, which capture meaning aspects of the entity that is conveyed by the gesture (McNeill, ), for example flapping hands representing a bird flying.  Iconic gestures have been suggested to facilitate word learning.  It is argued that iconic gestures are less arbitrary than most spoken symbols.  The visuospatial aspects of gesture help process the accompanying speech and lead to strengthened memory traces and deeper conceptual understanding (Hostetter, .  So, Chen-Hui & Wei-Shan, ).  A comprehensive review of the existing literature (Hostetter, ) proposed that gestures are particularly helpful to children.  The focus of the present study is on word learning in typically developing (TD) children and in children with specific language impairment (SLI).  Previous research indicated a gesture advantage in children with SLI as compared to their TD peers such that they show stronger associations between gesture and language (Botting, Riches, Gaynor & Morgan, ), and benefit more from gesture input for pragmatic comprehension (Kirk, Pine & Ryder, .  Lavelli, Barachetti & Florit, ).  So far, this has not been demonstrated for word learning.  Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the influence of gestures on word learning in typically developing and language impaired populations.  Word learning in children with SLI.  SLI is defined as a developmental language disorder in the absence of any identifiable reason for the disorder (Bishop, .  Leonard, ).  It is generally agreed that the population is heterogeneous and that children with SLI show various deficits in language, including slow acquisition of the lexicon and grammar, and limited comprehension and production of vocabulary or grammatical forms (Bishop & Snowling, .  Conti-Ramsden & Botting, .  Leonard, ).  Limited processing capacities and difficulty with sustained attention are reported as well (Alt, Myers & Alt, .  Ebert & Kohnert, .  Eichorn, Marton, Campanelli & Scheuer, .  McKean, Letts & Howard, .  Sheng & McGregor, ).  Problems with word learning are often part of the characteristics associated with SLI.  Word learning is a process in which word representations are gradually established, starting from an incomplete representation after first perceiving the new form–referent link through fast mapping until the word is represented and stored completely through slow mapping (Horst & Samuelson, .  Justice, Meier & Walpole, ).  Children with SLI are reported to have weak word knowledge, i. e.  weak semantic and phonological representations, compared to peers.  Thereby, both fast and slow mapping are affected (Alt et al. , .  Gray, .  McKean et al. , ).  Given that the vocabulary deficiencies seem to reflect immaturities in semantic representation (McGregor, Newman, Reilly & Capone, .  Sheng & McGregor, ), methods to support word learning in children with SLI are desirable.  Below, we summarize findings regarding the role of iconic gesture as a means of enhancing word learning in TD children and children with SLI.  Contribution of observing iconic gesture to children’s word learning.  For word learning, children use a number of cues, gestures among them.  To derive benefit from iconic gestures, two mechanisms are important.  First, the child has to be capable of detecting the meaning conveyed by the gesture.  While still fragile in toddlerhood, the ability to derive meaning from iconic gestures develops at three years of age and is acquired by age .  to .  (Namy, Campbell & Tomasello, .  Novack, Goldin-Meadow & Woodward, .  Stanfield, Williamson & Özçaliṣkan, .  Tolar, Lederberg, Gokhale & Tomasello, ).  Preschool children can also learn from arbitrary gestures, but once they are able to recognize iconicity they learn from iconic gestures more readily than from arbitrary ones (Marentette & Nicoladis .  Namy et al. , ).  Besides, some types of iconic gestures appear to be easier to identify than others, for example gestures depicting actions associated with an object (Hodges, Özçaliṣkan & Williamson, ), and gestures showing how an object is handled are recognized earlier in development than gestures based on the shape of an object (Tolar et al. , ).  Second, the child has to be able to process and integrate multimodal information.  While typical word learning implies mapping a spoken word onto a referent, word learning paired with gestures requires additional cognitive demands such that both a spoken word and a gesture have to be mapped onto the referent (Puccini & Liszkowski, ).  It has been shown that children at age three are able to integrate information presented in iconic gesture and speech (Sekine, Sowden & Kita, ).  Evidence supporting the notion that observing iconic gestures facilitates word learning for a range of word classes comes from studies with young TD children.  It has been demonstrated that seeing iconic gestures helped preschool children to focus on a particular aspect of novel verbs and thereby enhanced learning their meaning (Goodrich & Hudson Kam, .  Mumford & Kita ).  Capone and McGregor () showed that co-speech iconic gestures exemplifying the shape and function of novel objects improved word retrieval in toddlers.  Moreover, iconic shape gestures were more effective than pointing gestures (Capone Singleton, ).  McGregor, Rohlfing, Bean, and Marschner () taught two-year-olds the preposition under either with or without iconic gestures.  At delayed post-test, children showed a more robust and abstract knowledge of the meaning when the words were paired with a gesture.  Moreover, it was found that observing iconic gestures was particularly effective when spoken messages were complex (McNeil, Alibali & Evans, ).  Observing iconic gestures appears to improve immediate comprehension and, in particular, benefit slow mapping (McGregor et al. , .  Munro, Baker, McGregor, Docking & Arciuli, ).  Two studies suggest that iconic co-speech gestures can serve to scaffold word learning in children with SLI.  Work by Ellis Weismer and Hesketh () has shown that in a fast mapping task children with SLI as well as TD children understood novel spatial terms better when the words were trained with iconic gestures compared to words trained without additional input.  However, there were no effects on naming.  Lüke and Ritterfeld () expanded this work by additionally investigating slow mapping.  Effects of observing iconic shape gestures on the learning of names for cartoon characters were compared to a no-gesture condition.  Contrary to Ellis Weismer and Hesketh’s () study, no immediate advantage of the iconic gesture condition emerged.  However, during slow mapping children showed a gesture benefit for naming – but not for comprehension.  The authors of both studies conclude that observing iconic gestures leads to more efficient word learning in children with SLI.  Yet, generalization of this conclusion has serious limitations.  First, stimuli used in the studies (novel words for spatial terms, whose meaning children already knew, and proper names for cartoon characters) are not representative of the words children acquire.  Second, the number of children with SLI in the experimental groups was rather small (eight and ten children, respectively).  Moreover, in both studies the control condition was merely an absence of gesture, involving no additional cues beyond speech.  Hence, word learning conditions differed with respect to their processing demands (So et al. , .  Yap, So, Yap & Tan, ).  Whilst in the iconic learning condition both a spoken word and a gesture had to be mapped onto the referent, the control condition required the child to process auditory information only (Puccini & Liszkowski, ).  In a ‘gesture vs.  no-gesture’ design, it remains unclear whether children benefit from iconic gestures due to the specific information conveyed by the gesture, or rather because the additional visual input directed children’s attention to the target words and thus improved learning.  In order to show that iconic gestures do more than focus attention, demonstration of an iconic gesture benefit over a control condition that goes beyond a no-gesture condition is required.  However, studies comparing two different gesture types in word learning (in terms of mapping a lexical form and semantics) are rare.  Lüke and Ritterfeld () conducted a fast mapping experiment and found that both iconic and arbitrary gestures had a beneficial effect on TD preschoolers’ initial word learning.  Capone Singleton () demonstrated enhanced learning of novel nouns paired with iconic gestures as compared to pointing gestures.  Pointing gestures are stationary gestures which scaffold referential understanding by focusing children’s attention on the referent whose lexical form they are learning (Novack et al. , ), provided the referent is in the immediate environment.  Iconic gestures, however, require attention to hand movement and represent referents (Puccini & Liszkowski, ).  Results led Capone Singleton () to suggest that iconic gestures enrich semantic learning, establish more robust word knowledge, and in this way make word learning more efficient than pointing gestures do.  The current study set out to substantiate and expand these findings.  <Middle> Current study.  For this purpose, we designed a study to compare the learning of unknown words (nouns and verbs) in a within-subjects design under two gesture conditions.  In the experimental condition, new words were taught with iconic gestures.  To ensure that a potential iconic gesture advantage does not merely reflect enhanced attention to the target word, we applied a control condition, in which the target words were paired with an attention-directing gesture in the form of a raised forefinger in front of the upper body.  Such a gesture does not convey the semantic meaning of the referents, and resembles pointing gestures in that it is stationary and visually guides attention.  At the same time, the control gesture covers functions of iconic gestures, such that it directs attention to hand movement, nevertheless lacking the specific property of iconic gestures, namely visually capturing meaning aspects of the referent.  Rather, the control gesture guides listeners to attend to particular parts of the utterance, increases the salience of the word, and thus serves a metalinguistic purpose.  Such a control condition enabled us to investigate whether iconic gestures do more than focus attention.  This approach allowed us to compare two conditions where both the spoken word and a gesture have to be mapped onto the referent.  In a subsequent control experiment, we modified the control condition by using different arbitrary gestures instead of the constant attention-directing gesture.  We investigated the ability to learn words in two gesture conditions in TD children and children with SLI, and assumed that children of either group could master the task.  Our main research interest was on the relative effect of observing co-speech iconic gestures on word learning.  The following hypotheses were tested.  .  Observing iconic co-speech gestures should impact more effectively on word learning than observing non-iconic gestures.  This hypothesis grounds on research showing that children by the age of three can master the cognitive requirements to process co-speech gesture and can learn from iconic gestures.  Moreover, enhanced learning with iconic gestures as compared to pointing gestures was demonstrated in young TD children (Capone Singleton, ).  We expected that this effect would apply to the learning of both nouns and verbs, since an iconic advantage over mere verbal input has been found for a range of word classes, including nouns and verbs.  Finally, former research gives rise to the hypothesis that such an iconic effect should be apparent at both the initial learning and the retention of the new words.  .  It was expected that observing iconic gestures would have a positive influence on word learning in children with and without language impairment.  However, as children with SLI are a special group of language learners it is unclear whether the degree of the iconic gesture advantage differs across groups. A word learning study was conducted employing a mixed design to test for differences between two learning conditions, involving three groups of preschool children.  (i) twenty children with SLI.  (ii) twenty TD children matched individually for chronological age (± months) and gender (age-matched group, AM).  and (iii) twenty TD children matched individually to children with SLI for grammar comprehension and word comprehension scores (±½ SD) (language-matched group, LM).  Observations extended over three points in time.  The University of Applied Sciences Fresenius Ethics Committee gave approval for the study.  Participants.  Participants in the study were TD children and children with SLI from the wider areas of Frankfurt and Hamburg in Germany.  TD children were recruited via nurseries, children with SLI via certified speech–language therapists.  All children were drawn from middle-class backgrounds regarding parental education and professional training as indicated by parent reports.  The parents gave informed consent to the study and answered a questionnaire focusing on the child’s general and language development.  Criteria for inclusion were.  (i) age under six.  (ii) normal general development, including physical, sensory, and non-verbal cognitive skills according to parent reports.  and (iii) monolingual German speakers.  Children with SLI had formerly been diagnosed by the child’s speech and language therapist.  Detailed information regarding language skills and intervention was obtained through a therapist-reported questionnaire.  Importantly, no treatment involved gestures.  The diagnoses and information concerning language and non-verbal cognitive skills were confirmed by standardized measures administered before training.  Non-verbal cognitive ability was measured using the Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM.  Raven, Bulheller & Häcker, ) in SLI and AM children.  Since this test does not provide normative data for children under age . , non-verbal cognitive ability in LM children was measured using the subtest ‘Muster legen’ (patterns identification) of the Wiener Entwicklungstest (WET.  Kastner-Koller & Deimann, ).  Language ability was measured using validated norm-referenced tests frequently used in clinical practice in Germany.  The skills assessed were as follows.  (i) grammar comprehension using the test for reception of grammar – German version (TROG-D.  Fox, ).  (ii) receptive and expressive vocabulary (nouns and verbs) using subtests of the Patholinguistische Diagnostik bei Sprachentwicklungsstörungen (PDSS.  Kauschke & Siegmüller, ).  (iii) word definition using a subtest of the WET (Kastner-Koller & Deimann, ).  and (iv) nonword repetition using a subtest of the Sprachentwicklungstest für drei- bis fünfjährige Kinder (SETK–.  Grimm, ).  Additionally, speech sound disorders were assessed using the screening version of the Psycholinguistische Analyse kindlicher Sprechstörungen (PLAKSS.  Fox, ).  To examine scoring reliability, a second investigator scored % of the standardized assessments.  Overall agreement was %.  In addition to parent report and therapist’s diagnosis, to be included in the group with SLI the child had to perform more than one standard deviation (SD) below the mean on at least three of the language subtests administered.  Controls had to perform within normal range in all language assessments.  Five children with SLI and thirteen TD children who did not meet the criteria were excluded from the study.  The final sample consisted of twenty children with SLI ( girls,  boys) with a mean age of .  (SD . ), twenty children matched for age and gender (AM.  mean age . , SD . ), and twenty younger children matched for language (LM.   girls,  boys.  mean age . , SD . ).  Group means and standard deviations of the cognitive and language testing in terms of percentile ranks and raw scores as well as between-group comparisons for the children with SLI and the control groups are reported in Table .  All children fulfilled the requirement of lying within the normal range for non-verbal cognition.  One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant group effect (F(,) = ·, p = ·, ω = ·).  Post-hoc analyses (Bonferroni) revealed that AM children performed significantly better than LM children on the cognitive measure (p = ·), an effect which we attribute to the use of different tests in AM and LM children.  There was no significant difference between LM and SLI children (p = ·).  AM children did not differ from children with SLI with respect to non-verbal cognition (p = ·).  Note that we were not interested in whether AM children performed better in the training than children with SLI, but instead in how the different groups responded to the learning conditions.  Regarding language measures, mean scores for the children with SLI were significantly lower than the scores of the AM children on each of the measures, whereas they did not differ from those of the LM children.  All children with SLI exhibited limited expressive language abilities, eleven children also showed receptive limitations.  TD children exhibited overall normal-range performance.  General procedure.  All assessments and training took part in a separate room in children’s nurseries.  Within two weeks, children were seen individually for six sessions lasting approximately  minutes each.  All sessions were video recorded (JVC camcorder HD Everio GZ-V).  The procedure of the assessment and the training was explained to the children by the investigator in a child-appropriate way.  The first two sessions comprised assessment of non-verbal cognition and language measures (independent variables).  Moreover, children’s knowledge of the target words to be learned in the training (dependent variables.  naming and comprehension task) was assessed (T).  Subsequently, three training sessions were conducted two to three days apart.  The target words were introduced during the first session and repeated in the following two sessions.  Learning achievement was assessed immediately after the first training (T, fast mapping) and two to three days after completion of the training (T, slow mapping) – as shown in Figure .  Target stimuli.  The target items consisted of twelve German words ( nouns and  verbs).  Nouns represented rare animal species, verbs were intransitive and represented unusual movement types.  When using real words in a training study, it is vital to ensure that children do not know the words prior to training.  Thus, nouns and verbs of very low frequency were chosen from German dictionaries.  Word frequency, if available, was determined by use of the corpus-based collection of the University of Leipzig (University of Leipzig, –).  In a pre-study, the words had been tested in TD four-year-old and five-year-old monolingual German children.  None of the children (n = ) had been able to name any of the stimuli.  Assessment of comprehension – when presenting the target item and three distractors – showed a maximum of % to % of correct reactions to stimuli, which is below the chance level of %.  Word forms were monosyllabic or bisyllabic, following the German trochaic prosodic pattern.  A pilot study revealed that children between four and five years of age were easily able to learn twelve words.  For younger children and children with SLI, however, learning twelve words caused mental overload, reduced attention during training, and led to floor effects.  For these children, learning eight new words turned out to be appropriate.  In order to avoid ceiling or floor effects, we decided to train unequal numbers of target words ( in AM,  in LM and children with SLI).  Accordingly, data analyses are based on percentages.  Learning conditions.  Children learned words under two conditions.  in the iconic gesture condition (ICON), spoken stimuli were paired with a gesture that highlighted the shape of the animal (nouns) or the manner and/or path of the movement (verbs).  Shape gestures had been shown to particularly support noun learning (Capone & McGregor, ) whereas manner gestures helped children interpret new verbs (Mumford & Kita, ).  The gestures were dynamic iconic symbols lasting for – seconds, performed with the hands in the upper body or head region.  A gesture-to-referent matching task was conducted with twenty-four adult students (age –), confirming that adults were able to match the gestures to the respective referents in % to % on average.  In the control condition, stimuli were paired with an attention-directing gesture (ATTENT) in the form of a raised forefinger in front of the upper body.  Stimuli and conditions are given in Table .  Half of the target words were learned in the ICON condition, the other half in the ATTENT condition.  Words to be learned in the ICON and the ATTENT gesture condition were counterbalanced across children but remained paired with the referent throughout training.  Training procedure All target words were introduced in the first training session and repeated in the next two sessions.  Children were taught the words following a standard protocol, hearing the target words repeatedly being paired with either the ICON or ATTENT gesture.  Children were allowed, but not encouraged, to imitate the gestures.  however, their gesturing was not responded to.  Throughout training, children were exposed to each target word twenty times before the first learning assessment (T) and fifty-seven times before the second (T).  Since preschool children are familiar with listening to stories and benefit for word learning (Horst, Parsons & Bryan, ), a story was created and illustrated in a story book.  The story comprised all target words and served as basis for the training.  Training sessions were organized in three phases and specified in detail in a comprehensive training manual (see Table  for an overview of the content of sessions).  Learning assessment We were interested in both the initial stage of word learning (fast mapping) and in the subsequent stage of gradual differentiation and retention of the word’s meaning (slow mapping).  Since our pilot study suggested that compliance and task performance deteriorated with repeated testing, we chose to assess learning performance immediately after the first training session (T) and two to three days after training completion (T).  Learning achievement was assessed through naming and comprehension tasks.  a.  Assessment of naming performance.  a single coloured picture of the target in the middle of a page was shown to the child.  The child was asked “What is this. ” or “What is he doing. ”, respectively.  Responses were classified as accurate if the child produced the target word or a morphological variant within a multiple-word response.  Responses of children evidencing phonological difficulty were scored as correct if the phonological variation of the word had systematically been observed in the child’s productions on the assessment measures.  b.  Assessment of comprehension performance.  the investigator presented the target word and the child had to point to one of four coloured pictures on a page (one target and three distractors).  Two distractors depicted an animal or movement that were taught during training, one distractor depicted an animal or movement not included in the training that was similar in shape and category to the target (e. g.  target.  rail, distractor.  blackbird).  To be counted as a correct comprehension response, the child had to point to the respective target.  Children earned one point for each correct response.  For both naming and comprehension, self-corrections leading to the targets within  seconds were counted as accurate.  Performance scores are expressed in percentages as unequal numbers of words were trained across groups.  To evaluate scoring reliability, % of all dependent measures were scored via videotape by a second coder blind to the learning condition of responses.  The mean point-to-point agreement was %.  Data analysis Data were analyzed using omnibus -way mixed design ANOVAs with the independent variables (IV).  test time (T.  pre-test, T.  post-test , T.  post-test ) × gesture condition (ICON, ATTENT) × word class (nouns, verbs) as within-subjects factors, and group (SLI, LM, AM) as between-subjects factor for the dependent variables comprehension and naming.  Greenhouse–Geisser corrections were applied where necessary.  Significant main effects were resolved by pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni corrections.  P-values were considered significant at the p < · level.  To quantify differences among learning conditions, test times and word class effect sizes (partial eta squared.  ηp  ) were calculated.  Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics version .  RESULTS.  Omnibus -way analyses tested the effect of learning nouns and verbs under two gesture conditions (ICON vs.  ATTENT) over time (pre-test, post-test , post-test ) in children with SLI and TD children matched for language (LM) and age (AM).  As no effect of gender on learning performance was found, data are collapsed in all analyses.  We first report on the comprehension task before turning to the naming task.  Mean scores and standard deviations (SD) are shown in Tables  and , respectively.  An overview of main and interaction effects is given in Table .  Comprehension.  The ANOVA confirmed a main effect of test time (F(·,·) = ·, p < ·, ηp  = ·).  As expected, scores were significantly higher at T (M% ± SD.   ± ) than at T ( ± .  p < ·), which in turn were significantly higher than at T ( ± .  p < ·).  No between-groups effect emerged (F(,) = ·, p = ·, ηp  = ·), indicating that children of all groups were able to learn the new words.  There was a significant main effect of word class (F(,) = ·, p < ·, ηp  = ·), which was modified by significant interactions time × word class (F(,) = ·, p = ·, ηp  = ·), and time × word class × group (F(,) = ·, p = ·, ηp  = ·).  As our research focuses on gesture condition rather than word class per se, we did not follow up these effects.  Importantly, comprehension varied by gesture condition, as revealed by a significant main effect (F(,) = ·, p = ·, ηp  = ·).  Overall, children demonstrated better comprehension of words presented with ICON than ATTENT gestures.  No significant interaction time × gesture condition was found (F(,) = ·, p = ·, ηp  = ·), indicating that condition similarly influenced comprehension performance over time.  Critically, comprehension did not differ between conditions at pre-test (t() = ·, p = ·).
