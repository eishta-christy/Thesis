 I N T R O D U C T I O N Decades of research suggests that bilingual infants reach linguistic milestones, such as babbling and producing ﬁrst words, at the same rate as monolingual infants, despite the fact that the input that bilingual infants hear is much more complex (Nicoladis & Genesee, .  Oller, Eilers, Urbano & Cobo-Lewis, .  Pearson, Fernández, Lewedeg & Oller, ).  Bilingual infants are often exposed to two languages from birth, and they must use the speciﬁc properties of this dual input to diﬀerentiate one language from the other.  Despite these unique challenges, bilingual infants form lexical representations for words in each of their languages early on as they quickly begin to incorporate translation equivalents (TEs) into their vocabularies.  TEs, or doublets, are defined as lexical representations that a speaker has in each language for the same concept (e. g. , dog in English and chien in French).  Importantly, by the end of the second year, bilingual children’s vocabularies are composed of an average of approximately % TEs (Bosch & Ramon-Casas, .  David & Wei, .  Pearson, Fernández & Oller, .  Poulin-Dubois, Bialystok, Blaye, Polonia & Yott, ), although there is typically a great deal of variability between children.  This feat is quite impressive as it suggests that bilingual children are able to understand early on in development that two words can mean the same thing.  However, although the acquisition of TEs during infancy is an important part of bilingual vocabulary development, there are still many gaps in the literature on this topic, as most research has centered on case studies, or studies conducted with very small sample sizes.  More importantly, most studies on TE acquisition exclusively utilize parent report measures of vocabulary, and very few studies have investigated the development of TEs over time, using longitudinal designs.  As a result, our knowledge of the rate of TE development during infancy is quite limited.  In order to address these gaps in the literature, two experiments were conducted.  The aim of the ﬁrst experiment was to examine changes in the proportion of TEs on the MacArthur Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) across three developmental time-points.  By documenting TE acquisition in a sample of thirty-four French–English bilingual children at . , . , and . , our goal was to gain a better understanding of how young bilinguals acquire TEs during a period of accelerated vocabulary growth.  A secondary goal of this experiment was to acquire a better understanding of how changes in bilingual input and relative vocabulary size shape TE development, by examining the relation between changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size, and the proportion of TEs.  The aim of the second experiment presented in this paper was to investigate the utility of a direct measure of TE comprehension, and to compare the proportion of TEs derived from this measure with parent report of the same subset of words.  Within the vocabulary development literature, there has been some concern that parents of bilingual children might confound their child’s languages when reporting their receptive word knowledge on vocabulary checklists (Pearson et al. , ) such as the CDI (Fenson et al. , .  Trudeau, Frank & Poulin-Dubois, ).  The goal of this second experiment was to determine whether parent report of TEs mirrors a direct, laboratory-based measure of children’s TE development.  Language exposure.  The amount of time that a child is exposed to each of his or her languages appears to be signiﬁcantly related to vocabulary development in each language, with discrepancies in language exposure often leading to unbalanced vocabulary development (Bedore et al. , .  Bosch & Ramon-Casas, .  David & Wei, .  De Anda, Arias-Trejo, Poulin-Dubois, Zesiger & Friend, a.  De Houwer, .  De Houwer, Bornstein & De Coster, .  Eilers, Pearson & Cobo-Lewis, .  Grüter, Hurtado, Marchman & Fernald, .  Hoﬀ, .  Hurtado, Grüter, Marchman & Fernald, .  Pearson et al. , .  Place & Hoﬀ, .  Poulin-Dubois et al. , .  Thordardottir, ).  Several studies, for example, now show that young bilinguals tend to produce fewer words in each of their individual languages compared to monolingual infants (Core, Hoﬀ, Rumiche & Señor, .  Hoﬀ, Core, Place, Rumiche, Señor & Parra, .  Hoﬀ, Rumiche, Burridge, Ribot & Welsh, .  Oller, Pearson & Cobo-Lewis, .  Pearson, Fernández & Oller, ).  Furthermore, when exposure is unbalanced, children also have a tendency to produce more words in their dominant (L) compared to their non-dominant (L) language (Hurtado et al. , .  Pearson & Fernández, .  Pearson et al. , ).  Interestingly, however, when total (the number of words a child knows) or total conceptual (the number of concepts a child knows) vocabulary are taken into account, bilinguals are typically considered to produce as many words as their monolingual peers (Core et al. , .  Hoﬀ et al. , .  Junker & Stockman, .  Pearson et al. , ).  Given that it is well established that language exposure has a signiﬁcant impact on early vocabulary development, it is reasonable to think that the relative distribution of exposure in each language might also have an impact on the proportion of TEs that a child acquires.  However, whereas balanced exposure should theoretically result in balanced rates of TE acquisition, most children are not equally exposed to the languages that they hear (Hoﬀ, ).  Recent research has shown that although many parents make an eﬀort to provide balanced levels of exposure for their children, generally speaking, strategies such as the one-parent–one-language rule are not eﬀective in achieving this goal (De Houwer, ).  Other factors, such as the language preference of the child, the majority status of the child’s languages, the contexts in which they learn their languages, and individual diﬀerences in the quantity and quality of input speakers provide for the child, all contribute to uneven exposure patterns and, very often, uneven patterns of vocabulary growth (De Houwer, .  MacLeod, Fabiano-Smith, Boegner-Pagé & Fontolliet, .  Place & Hoﬀ, ).  Interestingly, although most bilingual children have at least some TEs in their early receptive and expressive vocabularies (Bosch & Ramon-Casas, .  Byers-Heinlein & Werker, .  De Houwer et al. , .  Deuchar & Quay, .  Genesee & Nicoladis, .  Holowka, Brosseau-Lapre & Petitto, .  Junker & Stockman, .  Nicoladis & Secco, .  Pearson et al. , .  Pearson et al. , .  Quay, .  Schelletter, ), there continues to be some debate in the literature regarding the extent to which quantity of language exposure plays a role in facilitating TE acquisition.  Whereas there is evidence to suggest that children who are raised in environments that are more conducive to balanced language acquisition tend to acquire a greater proportion of TEs early on in development (David & Wei, .  Montanari, .  Pearson et al. , ), there are also studies showing that quantity of L exposure is a poor predictor of how many TEs a child has in their vocabulary (Byers-Heinlein & Werker, .  Lanvers, .  Poulin-Dubois, D. , Blaye, Coutya & Bialystok, ).  Of note is the fact that although there is a great deal of individual variability in the proportion of TEs that a child acquires, we know that TE acquisition generally increases over time in relation to children’s vocabulary production (Montanari, ).  However, although several studies have now examined the process of TE acquisition in young bilinguals, the majority of these studies have been cross-sectional in nature, and few have examined the role that changes in language exposure and vocabulary ratios play in facilitating the acquisition of TEs longitudinally in the course of early vocabulary development.  A main goal of the present study was to examine how changes in relative language exposure and vocabulary size impact TE acquisition in very young bilinguals using a longitudinal design.  Measuring TE acquisition during infancy.  To date, the majority of research on TE acquisition in young bilinguals has been conducted using case studies and parent report measures, such as the CDI (David & Wei, .  De Houwer et al. , .  Junker & Stockman, .  Legacy, Zesiger, Friend & Poulin-Dubois, ).  Although the CDI is well established as a valid and reliable measure of vocabulary development in both monolingual and bilingual infants, and is praised for its quick and easy to use format, there has been some concern that parents of bilingual infants might confound their child’s languages when reporting their word knowledge on vocabulary checklists (Pearson et al. , ).  Importantly, although the CDI should ideally be ﬁlled out by two expert reporters, in the case of bilingual infants this is not always possible, and most often it is the primary caregiver who ﬁlls out both forms of the CDI.  Interestingly, De Houwer, Bornstein, and Leach () showed that single reporter CDI reports often underestimate monolingual children’s RECEPTIVE vocabulary knowledge.  This suggests that inaccurate reporting of vocabulary knowledge by single reporters might also aﬀect bilingual vocabulary estimates, as this task is much more complex for parents of bilingual children.  Whereas trying to diﬀerentiate the words that a bilingual child SAYS in each of their languages can be diﬃcult for parents (Lust et al. , ), trying to diﬀerentiate the words that a child COMPREHENDS in each language can be even more challenging.  As a result, Experiment  was conducted to address this issue.  By assessing the proportion of TEs that infants comprehended using a direct, touch-screen measure of vocabulary comprehension, and comparing these results to parent report of the same subsets of words on the CDI, we were able to determine how accurately parents were able to report on their child’s early comprehension of TEs.  <Middle> The present study.   In order to address gaps in the literature surrounding the acquisition of TEs in early bilingual vocabulary development, two studies were conducted.  Experiment  had two main goals.  (i) to gain a better understanding of how French–English bilinguals acquire TEs over time, by examining changes in the proportion of TEs on the CDI across three developmental time-points.  and (ii) to determine the roles that linguistic input and vocabulary growth play in shaping TE acquisition.  In order to accomplish these goals, TEs in infants’ expressive vocabularies were measured at . , . , and .  using the MacArthur Bates CDI, and changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size were examined as potential predictors of change in the proportion of TEs across waves.  We hypothesized that more balanced ratios of exposure and productive vocabulary size would be associated with larger proportions of TEs at each wave.  The purpose of Experiment , on the other hand, was to compare a direct, touch-screen measure of infants’ TE comprehension with parent report of the same subset of words.  We conducted this experiment to test the hypothesis that parents may be under- or over-reporting their children’s comprehension of TEs.  In accomplishing these goals, we aimed to acquire a better understanding not only of what TE acquisition looks like during early bilingual vocabulary development, but also how changes in input and relative vocabulary size shape this development, and how we can best measure the acquisition of TEs in bilingual infants’ receptive vocabularies.  By using a longitudinal design, as well as a direct measure of early TE comprehension, we aimed to provide an original contribution to the literature on bilingual vocabulary development.  EXPERIMENT.  M E T H O D.  Participants Participants were recruited through birth lists provided by a governmental health agency in Montréal, Canada.  In order to be eligible for each study, bilingual participants were required to be French–English bilinguals from birth, and needed to have at least % exposure to their second language.  Exposure to a third language, if any, was below %.  Participants from Experiment  attended three waves of data collection, beginning at . .  However, due to the longitudinal nature of the study, only children who contributed data at all three waves were included in the ﬁnal sample.  At Wave  of data collection, ﬁfty-seven infants participated in the study.  However, four children whose parents failed to return the vocabulary checklists were excluded.  Participants who completed Wave  of data collection were then asked to return six months later for Wave .  At this wave, a total of thirteen additional children were excluded due to missing data (n = ) or no longer meeting the language requirements for the study (n = ).  Wave  of data collection occurred seven months after participants returned for Wave .  At this wave, six additional participants were excluded due to missing data (n = ) or no longer meeting language requirements (n = ).  The ﬁnal cross-wave sample consisted of thirty-four bilinguals ( males and  females).  At Wave , children ranged in age from . · to . · (M = . ·) and were exposed to their non-dominant language an average of % of the time (M = %, SD = %, Range = –%).  At Wave , children ranged in age from . · to . · (M = . ·), with a mean level of L exposure of % (M = %, SD = %, Range = –%).  Finally, at Wave  children ranged in age from . · to . · (M = . ·), with a mean level of L exposure at % (SD = %, Range = –%).  Eighty-two percent of mothers held a university degree.  Materials.  Language Exposure Assessment Tool (LEAT).  This questionnaire has been used in previous studies to measure infants’ exposure to the languages that they hear (De Anda, Bosch, Poulin-Dubois, Zesiger & Friend, b).  The experimenter conducted an interview with a parent at each wave of data collection, to ask who communicates with the child on a weekly basis (e. g.  parents, educator, grandparents, etc. ), what languages they speak to the child, and for how long.  These data were then entered into an electronic form, and an estimate of the proportion of time that the child is exposed to each language was then calculated at . , . , and . , respectively.  CDI.  Words and Gestures.  The CDI.  WG is a vocabulary checklist that is completed by parents, and which measures infants’ receptive and expressive vocabulary at .  to . .  The American English (Fenson et al. , ) and French Canadian (Trudeau et al. , ) adaptations were used to measure vocabulary, with the English and French Canadian adaptations containing  and  words, respectively.  There are a total of  TE pairs on this form of the CDI.  CDI.  Words and Sentences.  The CDI.  WS is a parent report vocabulary checklist that measures toddlers’ expressive vocabulary, from .  to . .  The English and French Canadian adaptations (Fenson et al. , .  Trudeau et al. , ) contain  and  words, respectively, and include  TE pairs.  Procedure.  Expert speakers (parents, grandparents, educators, etc. ) who spoke to the children in each language were asked to ﬁll out the CDI in English or French at each wave, and two calculations were performed.  one to obtain an estimate of the proportion of TEs including cognates (words that are similar in both spelling and sound, such as pizza and pizza or jeans and jeans) and semi-cognates (words that are similar in sound but diﬀer slightly in spelling, such as banana and banane or mittens and mitaines), and one to obtain an estimate of the proportion of TEs excluding cognates and semi-cognates.  First, the total proportion of TEs including cognates and semi-cognates was calculated by summing the number of identiﬁed TE pairs on the CDIs and multiplying this score by two.  This number was then divided by the child’s total vocabulary minus non-equivalents (words that have no translation on the other CDI form).  A second proportion excluding cognates and semi-cognates was then calculated by summing the identiﬁed TE pairs on the CDIs, subtracting all cognate and semi-cognate pairs, and multiplying by two.  This number was then divided by the child’s total vocabulary minus cognates, semi-cognates, and non-equivalents.  Importantly, TE pairs (including both cognates and semi-cognates) on each of the CDI forms were identiﬁed by two independent and fully bilingual raters.  These raters then came to an agreement on which words from each form would be selected as pairs.  They also came to a consensus on which TEs would be classiﬁed as cognate or semi-cognate pairs.  Given that both the English and French forms contained a limited number of synonyms, it was decided that children would be given credit for one TE pair, even if they knew synonymous words for the same concept (e. g.  sofa and couch in English and divan and sofa in French).  After completing these calculations, a one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the total proportion of TEs at each wave, and correlations were computed to examine the relation between relative exposure, vocabulary size, and the proportion of TEs across time-points.  In order to investigate the impact of changes in exposure and relative vocabulary size on TE development, a hierarchical regression was also performed to determine the best predictor of change at each wave of data collection.  Given that no major diﬀerences were found between analyses using the total TE proportion and analyses using the proportion of TEs minus cognates and semi-cognates, all reported statistics are taken from analyses using the total proportion of TEs.  However, descriptive data have been included for the proportion of TEs with cognates and semi-cognates subtracted at each wave.  <Conclusion> R E S U L T S A N D D I S C U S S I O N.  At Wave , the proportion of TEs was calculated using data from the CDI.  WG.  The mean proportion of TEs in bilinguals’ expressive vocabulary at .  was % (with cognates and semi-cognates removed M = %).  At Waves  and , however, the proportion of TEs was calculated using results from the CDI.  WS.  The mean proportion of TEs in bilinguals’ expressive vocabulary at Wave  of data collection was % (with cognates and semi-cognates removed M = %), with it notably increasing to % (with cognates and semi-cognates removed M = %) by Wave  (see Table  and Figures  & ).  Importantly, bilinguals acquired as many new TEs from Wave  to Wave  as they did from Wave  to Wave , when considering both the total proportion of TEs at each wave, as well as the proportion of new TEs acquired across waves (i. e.  new TEs divided by new words added to children’s vocabulary across each -month period).  Importantly, children signiﬁcantly increased the proportion of TEs in their vocabularies by % between .  and .  (F(,) = ·, p = ·), with the proportion of TEs that infants acquired at Wave  being positively correlated with the same proportion of TEs measured at Wave  and at Wave  (see Table ).  This suggests that there is stability in the proportion of TEs and their rate of acquisition in children’s vocabularies.  Factors inﬂuencing TE acquisition in young bilinguals.  In order to examine the extent to which language exposure ratios impact TE acquisition in our sample of young bilinguals, ratios for vocabulary size and language exposure were calculated by dividing L raw scores by L raw scores for each variable (Hurtado et al. , ).  Log transformations were then applied to these ratios (with smaller values being associated with more balanced exposure and vocabulary size), and bivariate correlations were run using these relative measures (see Table ).  Importantly, and as expected, relative exposure was correlated with relative vocabulary size at Waves  and  of data collection, with a trend toward the same result at Wave .  Relative exposure also tended to be correlated across waves, with a trend toward the same result for relative vocabulary.  This suggests moderate stability in both relative language exposure and vocabulary size over time.  More importantly, both relative exposure and relative vocabulary size were correlated with the total proportion of TEs in children’s vocabularies at Waves  and , such that children with more balanced ratios of exposure and vocabulary exhibited a greater proportion of TEs in their vocabulary.  Although these results did not reach signiﬁcance at Wave , the correlations were in the expected direction.  Because children were only beginning to develop their productive vocabularies at this stage of development, and several children had not yet acquired TEs in their vocabularies, it is possible that there simply was not enough variability in the data to produce strong correlations at this wave.  In order to assess the impact of changes in relative exposure and vocabulary size on change in the proportion of TEs across waves, two regression analyses were conducted, one each for TE development from .  to .  and from .  to . .  The ﬁrst examined the predictive ability of changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size on TE development between .  and . .  Importantly, change in relative vocabulary size accounted for % of the variance in change across waves, and emerged as the best predictor in the model.  Children who exhibited more balanced rates of vocabulary growth (i. e.  adding approximately as many new words in L as they did in L across waves) accumulated more new TEs across waves (ΔF(,) = ·, p = ·.  see Table ).  The second regression examined the predictive ability of changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size on TE development between .  and . .  The results once again indicated that changes in the ratio of L. L vocabulary size best predicted change in the proportion of TEs across waves, such that children who exhibited more balanced rates of acquisition accumulated more new TEs (ΔF(,) = ·, p < ·).  Change in relative vocabulary size accounted for an additional % of the variance in TE acquisition across waves above and beyond change in relative exposure.  Importantly, change in language exposure accounted for only % of the variance in TE development from Wave  to Wave , and % of the variance from Wave  to Wave .  Although change in exposure did not emerge as a signiﬁcant predictor of change in the proportion of TEs from .  to .  and from .  to .  on its own, it was a signiﬁcant predictor of such changes across .  and .  when change in relative vocabulary size was also taken into account.  These results suggest that although change in relative language exposure is a moderating factor in the model, it is the ratio of words learned that has the greatest impact on TE development.  The fact that having a more balanced rate of vocabulary acquisition was predictive of TE development across each -month period is to be expected, as it provides more opportunities to acquire TE pairs.  However, the fact that language exposure per se is not a signiﬁcant predictor of this development suggests that it is children’s ability to utilize the input in their environment to learn new words that matters the most with respect to TE development.  Although change in relative exposure was signiﬁcantly correlated with change in relative vocabulary from .  to .  (r() = ·, p = ·), this was not the case from .  to .  (r() = –·, p = ·).  This suggests that there may be more inherent error in parents’ report of language exposure or vocabulary size at Wave , perhaps due to more children entering day care or preschool settings.  EXPERIMENT.  M E T H O D S.  The purpose of this second experiment was to compare a direct measure of children’s TE comprehension with parent report of the same subset of words.  We conducted this experiment to test the hypothesis that parents might under- or over-report TE comprehension.  Participants.  Participants were recruited through birth lists provided by a governmental health agency in Montréal, Canada.  Once again, in order to be eligible for each study, bilingual participants were required to be French–English bilinguals from birth, and needed to have at least % exposure to their second language.  Exposure to a third language, if any, was below %.  A total of twenty-two bilingual participants were tested.  Of these twenty-two toddlers, two were excluded due to missing vocabulary measures.  The ﬁnal sample consisted of twenty simultaneous French–English bilingual toddlers ( females and  males) ranging in age from . · to . · (M = . ·).  The mean for second language exposure was % (SD = , Range = –%).  Materials.  Language Exposure Assessment Tool (LEAT).  Language exposure was assessed in the same manner as in Experiment  (De Anda et al. , b).  Computerized Comprehension Task (CCT).  The CCT (Friend & Keplinger, ) is a laboratory-based measure that assesses a child’s receptive vocabulary in French and English by presenting two images simultaneously on a touch screen and asking the child to touch the target image when prompted (e. g.  “Where is the chair.  Touch chair. ”).  Test trials consisted of forty pairs of images that were accompanied by auditory reinforcement when the child correctly touched a target image.  This task is available in French, English, and Spanish, and was originally intended for monolingual children.  Consequently, there were very few pairs of TEs incorporated into the original English and French CCT adaptations.  Therefore, this task was adapted to obtain versions that would contain only words with the same meaning in both languages (e. g.  diaper in English and couche in French).  The pairs of images consisted of nouns ( pairs), verbs ( pairs), and adjectives ( pairs), and corresponded to words included on the CDI (Friend, Schmitt & Simpson, ).  Each image appeared on the screen for seven seconds, and pairs of images were balanced for diﬃculty, brightness, word class, color, and size.  Additionally, the test trials diﬀered in diﬃculty level (easy, moderately diﬃcult, and diﬃcult).  Word diﬃculty level was established based on normative parent data from the CDI.  WG (Dale & Fenson, ).  The proportion of TEs for each child was calculated by summing the total number of correctly identiﬁed TE pairs, multiplying this number by two, and dividing by the total number of correctly identiﬁed words on the CCT in both languages.  Twenty-ﬁve percent of the sample was coded by a second coder to determine inter-rater reliability.  Inter-rater reliability was excellent, with a Pearson correlation of .  for the English task and .  for the French task.  Computerized Comprehension Task Checklist (CCT Checklist).  This checklist was created for the purpose of this study.  There is an English as well as a French version, both of which include the same set of words included in the adapted CCT.  There are forty words on each checklist, and parents were asked to check oﬀ words that their child comprehends.  Ninety percent of parents who completed the CCT checklist spoke both English and French.  Procedure.  Parents and children came in for two visits, scheduled approximately one week apart.  On the ﬁrst visit, there was a warm-up period for the child to become acquainted with the experimenter.  During this period, the experimenter explained the study, and parents were asked to read and sign the written consent form.  Afterwards, parents were asked to complete the CCT Checklist in both English and French.  Upon completion of the questionnaires, the experimenter administered either the French or the English CCT.  The initial language of testing for this task was counterbalanced across children.  Before starting the CCT, the child was seated on his/her parent’s lap, in order to be able to reach the screen.  Parents were also asked to wear a pair of darkened glasses to prevent inadvertently cuing their child during administration of the CCT.  On the second visit, the experimenter administered the CCT in the language that was not administered on the ﬁrst visit.  Parents were compensated with $, and toddlers received a gift at each visit, in addition to a certiﬁcate ofR E S U L T S A N D D I S C U S S I O N The results from the present study suggest that parents tend to over-report the number of TEs in their child’s vocabulary.  Parents reported that children had signiﬁcantly more TEs on the CCT checklist than children showed knowledge of on the CCT (t() = ·, p = ·.  see Table ).  That is, parents reported that their children knew on average % more TEs than they showed comprehension of on a direct measure of receptive vocabulary.  Importantly, although TEs on the CCT were not signiﬁcantly correlated with parents’ report of children’s TE comprehension, the correlation was in the expected direction (see Table ).  In addition to investigating the convergence between the children’s comprehension of TEs on the CCT and parent report, we also examined whether relative language exposure was able to predict both measures of TE development sample of children.  Whereas a signiﬁcant correlation emerged between relative exposure and parents’ report of TEs, no such correlation emerged between relative exposure and TEs as measured by the CCT.  Moreover, although both measures of TE acquisition were positively correlated with L vocabulary size, no signiﬁcant correlations emerged between relative vocabulary size and the proportion of TEs.  The fact that a discrepancy was observed between parent report and a direct measure of TEs suggests that parents may experience diﬃculty in reporting on their child’s comprehension of words across languages.  Moreover, the fact that a signiﬁcant correlation emerged between relative exposure and parents’ report of TEs, but not between relative exposure and TEs as measured by the CCT, suggests that parents may be drawing upon their sense of children’s relative language exposure in order to report on vocabulary knowledge.  Parents may also be using a more lenient criterion for comprehension than what is required of children on the CCT.  G E N E R A L D I S C U S S I O N The main goals of the present study were.  (i) to investigate the development of TEs in a sample of young bilinguals across three developmental time-points.  (ii) to examine whether relative language exposure contributes to early TE acquisition in these children.  and (iii) to examine the convergence of a direct measure of TE acquisition with parental report, in order to test the hypothesis that parents may be under- or over-reporting the number of TEs in children’s vocabularies.  T R A N S L A T I O N E Q U I VA L E N T S I N Y O U N G B I L I N G U A L S The results from the ﬁrst experiment indicate that by . , most children have TEs in their productive vocabulary, although there is a large degree of variability across children.  This is in line with previous research showing that TE acquisition begins early in development, typically during the ﬁrst year while children are still developing their receptive lexicons (Bosch & Ramon-Casas, .  Byers-Heinlein & Werker, .  De Houwer et al. , .  Deuchar & Quay, .  Genesee & Nicoladis, .  Holowka et al. , .  Junker & Stockman, .  Nicoladis & Secco, .  Pearson et al. , .  Pearson et al. , .  Quay, .  Schelletter, ).  It is important to note, however, that the mean proportions of TEs reported at . , . , and .  in the current study are somewhat higher than what has typically been observed in the literature (approximately %).  One possibility for this discrepancy is the diﬀerences in the methodologies that have been used in the literature to measure the proportion of TEs.  Four out of ten studies that have reported quantitative data on the presence of TEs in the lexicons of young bilinguals have used audiovisual recordings or diary entries to record data (Deuchar & Quay, .  Holowka et al. , .  Nicoladis & Secco, .  Schelletter, ).  These studies, conducted with both infants and toddlers, reported means of %, %, %, and % TEs, respectively.  The other six studies reported in the literature used parent report measures, such as the CDI and the Language Development Survey (LDS).  Although Byers-Heinlein and Werker () and Pearson et al.  () reported means of % and % TEs, respectively, using the CDI to measure vocabulary, Poulin-Dubois et al.  () reported a mean of %, and David and Wei () reported up to % TEs using the CDI.  Moreover, Junker and Stockman () reported a mean TE proportion of nearly % using the LDS, suggesting that the mean proportion of TEs observed in children’s vocabularies may in part be a function of the measure that is used.  It would appear that vocabulary checklists such as the CDI and LDS might provide more opportunities for TEs to be quantiﬁed than direct audiovisual measures and diary entries, which are dependent on children producing TEs in order for them to be quantiﬁed.  Moreover, in the present study, % of our sample in Experiment  received input in their second language more than % of the time at Wave , and % of our sample received similar input in their second language across Waves  and  of data collection.  Although the quantity of second-language exposure in the present study does not appear to diﬀer signiﬁcantly from other similar studies in the literature, the fact that most children had fairly balanced rates of exposure to each of their languages may have contributed to the larger proportion of TEs that was observed.  This, in conjunction with the fact that most parents were bilingual, often speaking both English and French regularly, may have in turn provided these children with additional opportunities to learn TEs.  Furthermore, although the oﬃcial language of Montréal is French, it is predominantly a bilingual city, with children frequently being exposed to English and French both at home and in the community.  Importantly, although all of these factors may have facilitated the acquisition of TEs in our sample, it is also reasonable to believe that the means reported here are simply products of individual variability, with our sample containing children with higher overall rates of TE acquisition than has been reported previously.  However, the observed eﬀect of relative vocabulary size on TE acquisition argues in favor of the former interpretation.  Importantly, given the longitudinal nature of the present study, we were able to show that TE acquisition appears to increase gradually along with total vocabulary size, and that rates of growth are fairly stable across the second year.  By . , relations emerged between relative exposure and vocabulary size and the proportion of TEs in children’s vocabularies.  These relations showed that children with a more balanced exposure typically developed more balanced vocabulary sizes in each of their languages, which in turn facilitated the acquisition of TEs.  This is in line with previous research showing that exposure can predict the proportion of TEs in children’s vocabularies (David & Wei, .  Montanari, .  Pearson et al. , ).  The ﬁnding that RELATIVE exposure is associated with RELATIVE vocabulary size, however, is in line with recent reports by Hurtado and colleagues ().  Importantly, both Hurtado et al.  () and Grüter et al.  () have suggested that correlating relative measures, such as language exposure, with raw scores, such as the number of words in a child’s productive vocabulary, often distorts the relation between input and vocabulary size.  To our knowledge, the present study is the ﬁrst to show that TE acquisition is directly related to both relative exposure and relative vocabulary size.  In addition to examining the relation between relative language exposure, relative vocabulary size, and proportion of TEs at each wave, we also aimed to investigate how changes in these aspects of vocabulary development might impact change in the proportion of TEs across waves.  Importantly, change in relative vocabulary size, as opposed to change in relative language exposure, emerged as a main predictor of TE development across waves.  More speciﬁcally, more balanced rates of word growth seemed to facilitate the acquisition of TEs across each developmental time-point.  Furthermore, although changes in relative language exposure appeared to predict changes in vocabulary ratios across .  and . , this was not the case across .  and . .  These data suggest that a greater degree of error may exist for parents’ report of exposure and vocabulary size at this later developmental time-point, or that factors other than language exposure may be driving children’s acquisition of new words in each of their languages.  Although we did not look speciﬁcally at quality of input or children’s language preferences in the present study, it is possible that these factors are playing a larger role in vocabulary growth at this stage of development.  The second experiment in this study aimed to examine the convergence of a direct measure of TE comprehension and parent report of the same subset of words.  To date, the majority of studies examining TE development in young bilingual children have used parent report measures, such as the MacArthur Bates CDI.  Although such measures are well established as providing eﬃcient and valid estimates of children’s vocabulary development, it is possible that parents of bilingual children may have more diﬃculty diﬀerentiating word knowledge in each of their child’s languages when reporting on these measures, ultimately leading to underor over-reporting of TEs.  This issue may be even more salient for parents when they are asked to report on their child’s comprehension of words, as opposed to their production, which is often much more evident and explicit for parents.  Interestingly, two studies comparing parent report of word comprehension with a looking-time measure in samples of monolingual infants aged .  provided conﬂicting results.  Whereas the ﬁrst study of this nature showed that parents have a tendency to underestimate infants’ comprehension on the CDI (Houston-Price, Mather & Sakkalou, ), the second study, which used the same tasks and procedure but diﬀerent stimuli, found that parents are able to accurately assess infants’ comprehension of words (Styles & Plunkett, ).  Although both studies were conducted with samples of British children aged . , Houston-Price et al. , used known and FAMILIAR word pairs, and Styles and Plunkett used known and UNFAMILIAR word pairs in their stimuli.  Moreover, whereas Houston-Price et al. , attempted to address issues such as object preference in their looking-time procedure by presenting word pairs more than once, Styles and Plunkett only presented each word pair once in an attempt to determine whether the familiarity of the distracter image impacts children’s looking patterns.  In doing so, they found that parents’ report of comprehension on the CDI was an accurate predictor of looking time.  They also suggested that the threshold for which parents mark an item on the CDI as understood is when an infant is able to correctly identify the target with only one presentation, in an unfamiliar environment, and in the presence of potentially confusing distracters (Styles & Plunkett, , p.  ).  Although lexical targets were tested only once on each form of the CCT, target images also appeared as distracter images throughout the administration.  In theory, this has the potential to inﬂate children’s vocabulary scores through use of the mutual exclusivity bias (although this did not appear to be the case, as our children did not reach ceiling on this task).
