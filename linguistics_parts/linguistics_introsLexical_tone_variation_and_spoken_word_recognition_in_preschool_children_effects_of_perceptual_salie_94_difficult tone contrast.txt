I N T R O D U C T I O N.  In order to recognize spoken words, children must harbor a very precise set of expectations about the relationship between sound and meaning.  Formulating this set of expectations is complicated by the inordinate variability intrinsic to human speech.  Learners must learn from experience how to assign appropriate relevance to the full range of variation in speech, gradually converging upon a phonological system that is closely aligned with the structure of the native lexicon.  Phonological specification within the developing lexicon has been extensively studied in Romance and Germanic languages, such as English, Spanish, and French (e. g.  Mani & Plunkett, .  Nazzi, .  Swingley & Aslin, , .  White & Morgan, ).  In contrast, such investigations remain a relative rarity in tone languages, yet tone languages comprise the linguistic majority.  They are widely spoken around the world and are more frequent than non-tone (or intonation) languages (Fromkin, .  Yip, ).  Moreover, over half of the world’s population speak a native tone language (Fromkin, ), yet empirical studies of language acquisition focus predominantly on native learners of intonation languages.  A by-product of a disproportionately weighty focus on languages such as English for understanding of the phonological lexicon is that effects of vowels and consonants on word recognition have been widely researched.  In contrast, our understanding of the consequences of tone variation on word recognition remains limited.  The purpose of the current study is to investigate the specificity of phonological representations for tones by exploring children’s responses to different types of lexical tone variation in spoken word recognition.  Tone languages are defined by tripartite phonological systems, which draw distinctions in word meaning by varying three levels of the phonological code.  consonants, vowels, and lexical tone.  The last source of variation, lexical tone, entails syllable-level shifts in fundamental frequency (or in its perceptual correspondent, vocal pitch), amplitude, and duration (Blicher, Diehl & Cohen, .  Edmondson & Esling, .  Leather, .  Liu & Samuel, .  Whalen & Xu, .  Wong & Diehl, ).  The most widely spoken tone language, Mandarin Chinese, has four lexical tones.  Tone  (high level tone), Tone  (rising tone), Tone  (dipping tone), and Tone  (falling tone) (see Figure  for a depiction of Mandarin Chinese tones).  Each tone communicates word meaning in conjunction with vowels and consonants.  For example, the word ma assumes different meanings based on the tone in which it is produced.  Ma means ‘mother’ when spoken in Tone , ‘hemp’ when spoken in Tone , ‘horse’ when spoken in Tone , and ‘to scold’ when said in Tone .  Learners of a tone language therefore have to simultaneously track meaningful variation in vowels, consonants, and tones to arrive at the phonological determinants of meaning.  Traditionally, in experimental research, children’s abilities to track phonological determinants of meaning were studied by investigating the accuracy and efficiency with which they recognized spoken words.  More specifically, measuring children’s sensitivity to words that deviate from their correct form via a phonological substitution (e. g.  fixation to an image of a cup upon hearing tup versus cup) have provided us with a powerful means with which to scrutinize the early phonological lexicon and the level of specificity therein.  Studies in this area, notably mispronunciation studies, have contributed significantly to our understanding of the degree of phonological definition associated with the nascent lexicon.  These investigations have also revealed some of the constraints on children’s sensitivity to mispronunciations, reporting moderating effects of the particular task employed (e. g.  preferential looking versus categorization tasks), the specific contrast used, the extent of deviation from the correct pronunciation, and of the age at which children are tested (e. g.  Curtin, Fennell & Escudero, .  Havy, Bertoncini & Nazzi, .  Mani, Coleman & Plunkett, .  Mani & Plunkett, , .  Singh, Goh & Wewalaarachchi, .  Swingley & Aslin, , .  Van der Feest, .  White&Morgan, ).  For the most part, mispronunciation studies have focused on manipulating vowels and consonants within familiar words and comparing children’s responses to correct and mispronounced words.  A much more marginal emphasis has been placed on researching how learners of tone languages represent lexical tones in their early lexicon.  Thus far, experimental studies on sensitivity to lexical tone in native learners of tone languages have focused on whether infants can discriminate lexical tones via habituation paradigms, rather than on the strength with which tone is represented in developing lexical representations.  Discrimination studies have demonstrated that the ability to distinguish lexical tones is observed in tone language learning infants within the first four to six months of life (Mattock & Burnham, .  Yeung, Chen & Werker, ), suggesting that sensitivity to tone contrasts is solidified in the tone learner prior to vowels and consonants (Yeung et al. , ).  A question to arise from the conclusion that tone sensitivity emerges early in infancy is whether this high degree of sensitivity applies across the native tone inventory or whether it is specific to particular tones.  Tsao () investigated Mandarin-learning infants’ abilities to discriminate different pairs of lexical tones at – months of age, revealing that infants’ abilities to discriminate lexical tones was mediated by the particular tone contrast involved.  salient Mandarin tone contrasts such as Tones  (high level) and  (dipping) tones were discriminated more accurately than very similar tones such as Tone  (rising) and Tone  (dipping).  Similar asynchronies in tone discrimination have also been observed in early childhood (Eliot, .  Hao, .  Kiriloff, .  Wong, Schwartz & Jenkins, .  Wong ).  This suggests that individual tones may be represented with unequal strength in infants’ learning systems.  Each of these prior studies has revealed different degrees of sensitivity to tone variation based on properties of individual tone pairs.  Specifically, as the similarity between tones increases, sensitivity to the tone contrast has been shown to increase incrementally (e. g.  Tsao, .  Wong , ), a phenomenon also documented in studies investigating sensitivity to phonetic segments such as consonants (White & Morgan, ).  Prior studies with phonetic segments, such as consonants, invite the strong possibility that patterns observed in auditory discrimination tasks do not always predict behavior in word learning tasks.  Specifically, successfully discriminated sounds in infancy are not always discretely bound to lexical representations in early childhood (e. g.  Stager & Werker, .  Werker, Fennell, Corcoran & Stager, ).  It is well attested that infants may be highly sensitive to particular sources of sound variation in a non-lexical context, but when they are faced with the added, simultaneous demands of linking the same sources of variation to meaning, they can exhibit a lesser awareness of phonological contrast (see Curtin, Byers-Heinlein & Werker, , for a discussion of these issues).  There has been one prior study investigating tone sensitivity in word recognition in a sample of tone language learners.  In a study by Singh et al.  (), two groups of Mandarin-learning children (toddlers and preschoolers) were presented with familiar words that were either correctly pronounced or altered via a consonant, vowel, or tone mispronunciation.  Each vowel and consonant mispronunciation entailed a single feature substitution and tone mispronunciations entailed tone substitutions between Tones , , and .  Children were tested at two age groups (· to · years and  to  years).  At both age groups, children showed similar degrees of sensitivity to vowel and consonant substitutions and a distinct pattern of results for tone substitutions.  This strongly suggests that it may not be viable to generalize from the wealth of knowledge on consonant and vowel representation to lexical tones, which may follow a unique course of acquisition.  In particular, toddlers demonstrated a very strong sensitivity to tone substitutions as compared with vowels and consonants, leading the authors to conclude that at this age children are very sensitive to tones as a source of lexical contrast.  This complements findings from infant auditory discrimination, revealing that native sensitivity to lexical tones emerges precociously, relative to vowels and consonants (see Yeung et al. , ).  Older children, however, demonstrated relatively strong mispronunciation effects for vowels and consonants as compared with the toddler sample.  However, they demonstrated relatively weak mispronunciation effects for tones, although tone mispronunciations were reliable detected.  The authors attributed this attenuation in tone discrimination to a growing appreciation for the multiplex of functions served by pitch in language, such as conveyance of emotional prosody, emphatic stress, questions versus statements.  The functional differentiation of pitch may be a late developing ability that emerges in the preschool years, as suggested by prior studies (Quam & Swingley, .  Singh & Chee, ).  The early attentiveness to lexical pitch reported in the toddler sample, however, is of direct relevance to the current study.  In particular, conclusions ventured by Singh et al.  (), that tone is preferentially encoded in early word representations in toddlers, were based on an aggregate response to tone mispronunciations, collapsing across different tone contrasts.  Each of the tone mispronunciations entailed relatively salient contrasts.  Moreover, the most difficult tone contrast to discriminate – Tones  and  – was not included in this study.  Tones  and  present an interesting pair to investigate as they are acoustically similar and they are also related via phonological rules.
