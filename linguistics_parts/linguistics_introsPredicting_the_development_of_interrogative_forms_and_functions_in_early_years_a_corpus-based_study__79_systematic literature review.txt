I N T R O D U C T I O N.  A large volume of research has been conducted over the last century to understand fully the development of interrogative forms and functions in English-speaking children (see Chouinard, , for a review).  However, Mandarin Chinese, the most widely spoken language in the world (Graddol, ), has not been equally empirically explored.  Recently, there have been Chinese studies examining the development of interrogative forms in L children (Fahn, .  Zhou, ), and forms (Ding, .  Gao, .  Yuan, ) and functions (Wang, .  Yuan, .  Zhu & Wu, ) in L learners.  However, very few were conducted with representative samples to establish the developmental norms or patterns of interrogative form and function in Mandarin Chinese.  We have already conducted a corpus-based study on early question acquisition in Cantonese-speaking young children in Hong Kong (Li, Tse, Wong, Wong & Leung, ).  Mandarin Chinese, however, differs greatly from Cantonese in terms of lexicon, syntax, and pronunciation (Tse & Li, ) and therefore deserves a similar study.  In addition, the Mandarin-speaking children in the present study have a monolingual language environment in Beijing, whereas their counterparts in Hong Kong thrive in a ‘trilingual and biliterate’ society (Li & Rao, ).  Comparing their acquisition of interrogative forms and functions can provide some cross-linguistic evidence for the effects of language environments.  This study is thus aimed at filling the gap in the literature.  Another objective of this study is to examine further the cross-linguistic universality of the Information Requesting Mechanism (IRM) proposed by Chouinard ().  Having reviewed all the studies on the early acquisition of English questions, Chouinard hypothesized that request for information (RfI) might be the universal and dominant function of children’s question.  This hypothesis, however, was challenged by our previous study on early child Cantonese in  children aged , , and  months (Li et al. , ), which found that request for action (RfA) rather than RfI might be the dominant interrogative function.  This inconsistent finding was regarded as the result of the cultural difference between Cantonese- and English-speaking young children (Li et al. , ).  But it might also be caused by the age differences in samples or the linguistic differences between English and Cantonese.  To verify this cultural influence, we need to conduct a similar study on Mandarin Chinese using samples that share the same Chinese culture and communication task but speak different languages.  Therefore, in this study, we thoroughly examine the interrogatives elicited from a similar early child Mandarin corpus and empirically explore the factors influencing the early acquisition of interrogatives in order to determine whether the IRM is applicable to Mandarin Chinese.  Development of interrogative forms in Mandarin Chinese.  Mandarin Chinese has a very complex interrogative system, which is composed of a large number of members.  question words (i. e.  ‘what’, ‘who’), question forms (i. e.  the ‘A-not-A’ construction), question mood particle (i. e.  ma), and intonation (Gao, ).  The various combinations of these members could make a question ambiguous and even controversial for Chinese speakers, and even linguists, in terms of the scope of questioning, the degree of question mood, and the degree of grammaticalization of various question forms.  This could easily lead to misunderstanding and miscommunication (Gao, ) and make the acquisition of interrogative forms a really challenging task (Gao, ) for young Mandarin-speaking children.  The Chinese interrogative form is challenging not only for young children but also for linguists, who have not achieved any consensus on a typology (Gao, .  Matthews & Yip, .  Ross & Ma, .  Tse & Li, ).  Liing () identified four major interrogative forms.  particle questions, ‘háishì’ questions, ‘A-not-A’ questions, and wh-questions.  Also, Chinese linguists have explored A-not-A questions in different syntactic contexts (Cheng, ), and their modularity and forms (Huang, .  Hsieh, ).  In this study, we adopted the most comprehensive and systematic typology, which was proposed by Matthews and Yip (), as it has been verified by our previous corpus-based studies on early child Cantonese (Tse & Li, .  Li et al. , ).  As Cantonese has many more interrogative forms than Mandarin Chinese (Li et al. , .  Li, Wong, Tse, Leung, & Ye, ), we used the eight forms commonly shared by Cantonese and Mandarin interrogatives to allow a cross-linguistic comparison between Cantonese and Mandarin interrogatives (for details, please see ‘Coding of the interrogatives’ below).  Currently, the most common topic for early interrogative studies concerns wh-questions in Mandarin Chinese.  Fahn () studied the acquisition of monoclausal wh-questions and found that subject wh-questions were much easier to learn than object wh-questions for Chinese children aged between four and six years.  Zhou () found that young children exhibited an adultlike sensitivity to the licensing environments for the non-interrogative use of wh-words.  Su, Jin, Wan, Zhang, and Su () found that young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could understand the question readings rather than the statement readings of wh-words.  Also, there have been other wh-question studies on L–L transfer and comparison among Japanese speakers (Yuan, ) and English speakers (Yuan, ), and on different strategies for the acquisition of different interrogative forms (Gao, ).  Another common topic is the sequence of question acquisition in Chinese children.  Ding () found that the sequence of yes/no question acquisition was ma question > tag question and ba question > rhetorical question, and this sequence was roughly similar for L and L Chinese learners.  Wong and Ingram () found that the sequence of Cantonese question acquisition between one and three years of age was particle/intonation questions > wh-questions > A-not-A questions.  They tended to believe that syntactic complexity, cognitive complexity, and personal/social factors, as well as their interactions, could have determined the sequence of question acquisition.  In addition, our previous Cantonese studies (Li et al. , .  Tse & Li, ) found that girls produced more types of interrogative forms than boys, and that there was a significant form–function preference, with wh- and multiple questions being primarily used to seek information.  Is the same pattern found in the interrogative development of Mandarin-speaking young children.  This study addresses this question by examining the development of interrogative forms with a large-scale sample of Mandarin-speaking young children.  Development of interrogative functions in Mandarin Chinese.  Interrogative function refers to the pragmatic function of questioning (Li et al. , ), and it has been widely and repeatedly studied in the past two centuries since Sully () identified two major functions of interrogatives.  asking for information (‘what’, ‘how old’, ‘where’, ‘who’) and asking for reasons and causes.  Piaget () created a complete typology of interrogative functions.  causality, reality and history, action and intention, classification and evaluation, and calculation.  Later on, Smith (), Holzman (), and Sachs and Devin () further categorized child questions into eight categories.  external world, internal state, request, imperative, attention getting, instruction, confirmation, and repetition.  Since the s, a corpus approach has been employed to investigate the development of interrogative functions (Freed, .  Sinclair & Gessel, ).  It is important to note that half of those functions identified in previous studies (Freed, .  Holzman, .  Piaget, .  Sinclair & Gessel, .  Sully, ) are asking for information (RfI), indicating that interrogatives often serve the function of information seeking.  Recently, Chouinard () conducted a systematic literature review and four separate studies on early interrogative development in young American children.  Together, the results of her four studies supported the existence of the IRM as a way for children to learn about the world.
