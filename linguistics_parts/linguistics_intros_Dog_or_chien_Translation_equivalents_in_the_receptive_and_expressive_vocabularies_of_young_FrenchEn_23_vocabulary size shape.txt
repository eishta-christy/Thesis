 I N T R O D U C T I O N Decades of research suggests that bilingual infants reach linguistic milestones, such as babbling and producing ﬁrst words, at the same rate as monolingual infants, despite the fact that the input that bilingual infants hear is much more complex (Nicoladis & Genesee, .  Oller, Eilers, Urbano & Cobo-Lewis, .  Pearson, Fernández, Lewedeg & Oller, ).  Bilingual infants are often exposed to two languages from birth, and they must use the speciﬁc properties of this dual input to diﬀerentiate one language from the other.  Despite these unique challenges, bilingual infants form lexical representations for words in each of their languages early on as they quickly begin to incorporate translation equivalents (TEs) into their vocabularies.  TEs, or doublets, are defined as lexical representations that a speaker has in each language for the same concept (e. g. , dog in English and chien in French).  Importantly, by the end of the second year, bilingual children’s vocabularies are composed of an average of approximately % TEs (Bosch & Ramon-Casas, .  David & Wei, .  Pearson, Fernández & Oller, .  Poulin-Dubois, Bialystok, Blaye, Polonia & Yott, ), although there is typically a great deal of variability between children.  This feat is quite impressive as it suggests that bilingual children are able to understand early on in development that two words can mean the same thing.  However, although the acquisition of TEs during infancy is an important part of bilingual vocabulary development, there are still many gaps in the literature on this topic, as most research has centered on case studies, or studies conducted with very small sample sizes.  More importantly, most studies on TE acquisition exclusively utilize parent report measures of vocabulary, and very few studies have investigated the development of TEs over time, using longitudinal designs.  As a result, our knowledge of the rate of TE development during infancy is quite limited.  In order to address these gaps in the literature, two experiments were conducted.  The aim of the ﬁrst experiment was to examine changes in the proportion of TEs on the MacArthur Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) across three developmental time-points.  By documenting TE acquisition in a sample of thirty-four French–English bilingual children at . , . , and . , our goal was to gain a better understanding of how young bilinguals acquire TEs during a period of accelerated vocabulary growth.  A secondary goal of this experiment was to acquire a better understanding of how changes in bilingual input and relative vocabulary size shape TE development, by examining the relation between changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size, and the proportion of TEs.  The aim of the second experiment presented in this paper was to investigate the utility of a direct measure of TE comprehension, and to compare the proportion of TEs derived from this measure with parent report of the same subset of words.
