Recent research on reading in English provides mounting evidence for the role of morphology in a variety of literacy skills.  Morphology refers to the aspect of language that deals with “word-formation processes, including inﬂections, derivations, and compounds” (Nagy, Carlisle, & Goodwin, 2014, p.  4).  Morphology provides meaningful cues for the reader and the speller, because it allows learners to analyze unknown words into their constituent morphemes and synthesize the morphemes into complex words.  Whereas some morphological processing operates automatically without conscious awareness (e. g. , Deacon, Parrila, & Kirby, 2008), the conscious metalinguistic sensitivity to morphological structure and the ability to manipulate morphemes have been referred to as morphological awareness (MA.  Carlisle, 1995).  The role of MA in word reading and reading comprehension has been well established in English monolinguals, above and beyond the effects of phonological awareness, vocabulary, and verbal and nonverbal intelligence (Carlisle, 1995.  Kieffer, & Lesaux, 2012.  Kirby et al. , 2012.  Nagy, Beringer, & Abbott, 2006).  MA has been linked to a variety of literacy skills, including reading accuracy, reading ﬂuency, reading comprehension (Roman, Kirby, Parrila, Wade-Woolley, & Deacon, 2009), spelling (Carlisle, 1987.  Deacon, Kirby, & Casselman-Bell, 2009.  Nunes & Bryant, 2006.  Nunes, Bryant, & Olsson, 2003), and vocabulary (Bowers & Kirby, 2010.  Carlisle & Fleming, 2003.  Nagy & Anderson, 1984).  Metaanalyses show that morphological instruction leads to signiﬁcant gains in vocabulary and reading (Bowers, Kirby, & Deacon, 2010.  Goodwin & Ahn, 2013).  Morphological problem solving has been linked to children’s ability to decipher previously untaught complex words (Anglin, 1993.  Bowers & Kirby, 2010.  Carlisle, 2007.  Carlisle & Fleming, 2003.  Wysocki & Jenkins, 1987).  All of these ﬁndings underscore the role of morphology in literacy outcomes.  In contrast, MA and reading by Arabic-speaking children is underresearched (Abu-Rabia, 2007, Abu-Rabia & Shalhoub-Awwad, 2004.  Saiegh-Haddad, 2013.  Saiegh-Haddad & Geva, 2008.  Shalhoub-Awwad & Leiken, 2016.  Taha & SaieghHaddad, 2016, 2017).  The available studies on processes of reading Arabic have included relatively small samples (sometimes not from a monolingual Arabic population), used a limited number of morphological tasks, or dealt exclusively with adults in priming experiments.  The paucity of research on MA in Arabic reading is conspicuous, particularly because morphology is a salient feature of the Arabic lexical structure.  The majority of Arabic words are at least bimorphemic because surface forms are derived by applying two abstract morphemic units (roots and word patterns.  Eviatar & Ibrahim, 2012).  Furthermore, Arabic morphology and orthography have a number of features that distinguish them from more commonly studied languages and orthographies such as English.  For example, as Boudelaa (2015) said, “The historically predominant analysis of Arabic morphology is stated in root-and pattern terms, where surface word forms are constructed by interleaving bound morphemes one within the other” (p.  2).  After describing the nature of morphological processing and morphological awareness, and reviewing evidence (in English) on the dimensionality of morphological awareness, we will return to a more detailed analysis of Arabic language, orthography, and morphology.  MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSING AND MORPHOLOGICAL AWARENESS.  It is important to note that there is a difference between MA and morphological processing.  The classical example of the “Wug test” devised by Berko (1958) has provided evidence that children as young as 4 years old have and can use knowledge about English morphological rules.  Children’s overgeneralization of the –ed suffix to irregular past tenses such ∗goed or ∗buyed is another example of their unconscious knowledge of their morphology system (Nagy et al. , 2014.  Owens, 2001).  These are examples of tacit morphological processing.  At the more explicit level, MA requires conscious working out of the morphological processes needed, that is, awareness.  There seems to be a fine line between MA and morphological processing, and sometimes it is not easy to differentiate between implicit and explicit MA tasks.  For example, selecting which of two sentences has correct morphology could be done by judging which sounds better, without any direct or explicit application of morphological knowledge.  Other tasks, for instance, constructing a word that has particular morphological characteristics, require more explicit morphological knowledge (Deacon et al. , 2008).  Bowers et al.  (2010) and Nagy et al.  (2014) have pointed out that this is a complex issue because existing measures of MA draw on both implicit and explicit processes.  Deacon et al.  (2008) argued that morphological tasks vary with respect to modality, content, and process, and proposed a taxonomy to delineate the types of MA tasks.  For example, a morphology task may use oral or written stimuli and oral or written responses.  The content of a morphology task could include inﬂectional or derivational morphology.  Furthermore, morphology tasks may ask participants to produce a response or judge the correctness of a particular response.  Other factors contributing to this complexity include developmental issues.  for example, younger children who are still in the process of reading acquisition may perform differently than older children who read more ﬂuently and have gained more vocabulary.  Another factor could be individual differences between children depending on the type of education they receive and their abilities, including intellectual abilities.  Task demands vary also and may tap other factor such as memory or syntax.  Finally, differences across languages/orthographies and the way the type of morphology (linear vs.  nonlinear or root based vs.  stem based) would play a role in the processes needed to process words.  THE DIMENSIONALITY OF MORPHOLOGICAL AWARENESS.  While numerous studies have examined the role of MA in the development of reading in English and other alphabetic orthographies, only a few studies have investigated the dimensionality of MA in English-speaking children (Muse, 2005) or adults (Tighe & Schatschneider, 2015).  Although a wide range of MA measures has been used across studies (Apel, Diehm, & Apel, 2013), only few studies (Muse, 2005.  Spencer et al. , 2015.  Tighe & Schatschneider, 2015) have examined the number of dimensions underlying multiple MA measures.  Muse (2005) administered nine MA measures to a sample of fourth graders and found that MA emerged as a single latent construct, having considered a number of possible distinctions underlying the morphological structure.  oral–written, implicit–explicit, multiple-choice versus production, inﬂection versus derivational, different levels of word complexity, and whether contextual clues were included or excluded.  Tighe and Schatschneider (2015) gave seven measures of MA and two vocabulary measures to a group of adult students, ﬁnding that MA divided into two dimensions, one for real words and one for pseudowords, each separate from vocabulary.  Furthermore, Spencer et al.  (2015) reported on the unidimensionality of morphological awareness in two studies using a number of different morphological awareness tasks and an expanded set of vocabulary measures examining the breadth and depth of vocabulary knowledge.  They emphasized that morphological awareness is an integral part of vocabulary knowledge and may even be considered a facet of an individual’s depth of vocabulary knowledge.  Spencer et al.  (2015) supported a unidimensional model that encompassed morphological awareness and vocabulary knowledge.  The variety of MA measures used in the literature spans many differences in task requirements, as described in the above studies and in the taxonomy proposed by Deacon et al.  (2008).  Although there are linguistic differences between Arabic and English, it is important to note that the current study is partially framed in terms of the English literature on morphological awareness only because that is the greatest amount of literature available.  Hence, the multidimensionality of MA as a construct needs to be explored further, and in languages other than English.  No study has investigated the construct of MA and examined its relationship to reading among native Arabic-speaking children using multiple measures with distinct task requirements.  ARABIC LANGUAGE AND ORTHOGRAPHY.  Arabic is a Semitic language.  Its orthography has 28 letters that are primarily consonantal, is written from right to left, and uses superscripted diacritics to mark its three short vowels (Saiegh-Haddad & Henkin-Roitfarb, 2014).  When Arabic orthography employs the diacritics, it is considered to be a shallow (i. e. , transparent) orthography.  However, when Arabic words and texts appear without superscripted vowels (diacritics), it is considered to be a deep (i. e. , opaque) orthography.  Abu-Rabia (2001) demonstrated that vowelized words and text were read more accurately than nonvowelized words and text by skilled Arabic readers.  However, Shalhoub-Awwad and Leikin (2016) showed that morphological knowledge conveyed by the consistency in the word patterns compensated for the missing vowels.  In explaining how readers of Semitic languages such as Arabic and Hebrew read when short vowels are omitted, Hansen (2014) argued “The fact that short vowels are normally omitted in Semitic writing makes decoding more reliant on other kinds of information than phonology.  .  .  .  , decoding is predominantly orthographic, and the vast number of homographs makes the reader heavily dependent on context in the quest for the meaning of words” (p.  71).  A description of the Arabic language would be incomplete without a mention of diglossia.  The term diglossia describes two linguistically related varieties of a language.  the standard and the spoken (Ferguson, 1959).  Literary or Standard Arabic is used in writing and in formal communication, whereas spoken Arabic, a linguistically related form usually referred to as colloquial Arabic, is used in daily conversation.  Although each country in the Arab world has its own distinguishing dialects, they all share the same standard language, which is the only form that appears in conventional writing.  All literate Arab persons are taught this standard form in formal schooling and are expected to read and write using this written standard form regardless of their spoken dialects (Tibi & McLeod, 2014).  The difference between the standard form and the dialect has been referred as “linguistic distance” by Saiegh-Haddad (2003), and the differences exist at the phonological, morphological, syntactic, and lexical levels.  In a series of studies, Saiegh-Haddad (2003, 2004, 2005) tested the impact of the phonological distance on phonological awareness and word decoding, and showed that the difﬁculty children have with Standard Arabic phonemes appears to be related to the quality of phonological representations in long-term memory.  In a recent study, SaieghHaddad and Schiff (2016) showed that this affects reading in both vowelized and unvowelized Arabic across the school grades (Grades 2–10).  If we acknowledge that “reading is jointly deﬁned by a language and by the writing system that encodes the language” (Perfetti, 2003, p.  4), then Arabic reading acquisition in the context of diglossia deserves to be investigated further.  In spite of considerable overlap between spoken Arabic and Standard Arabic, diglossia is evident in all aspects of the language.  phonology, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary.  For example, morphology in spoken Arabic has fewer inﬂections than Standard Arabic (for a review, see Saiegh-Haddad & Henkin-Roitfarb, 2014).  ARABIC MORPHOLOGY.  The cross-linguistic differences between Arabic and more commonly studied languages like English extend to its morphology.  Arabic morphology is in sharp contrast with Indo-European morphology in its linguistic structure and functions (Boudelaa, 2014.  Boudelaa, Pulverm¨uller, Hauk, Shtyrov, & Marslen-Wilson, 2010.  Frost, 2012.  Saiegh-Haddad, 2013.  Saiegh-Haddad & Henkin-Roitfarb, 2014).  Two main systems make up Arabic morphology.  inﬂectional and derivational.  Inﬂectional morphology provides information about the grammatical functions of a word such as gender, number (singular, dual, and plural), person, case, mood, and tense (see Saiegh-Haddad & Henkin-Roitfarb, 2014).  In this inﬂectional system, preﬁxes, sufﬁxes, or both are added to real words in a linear fashion /kitaab/ “one book” /kitaabaan/ “two books. ” In Arabic derivational morphology, words are formed by combining two bound morphemes (root and word pattern).  The root is only consonantal and carries the general meaning of the lexeme, whereas the word pattern is mainly vocalic and provides phonological and morphosyntactic information (Holes, 2004).  Derivations are formed by interleaving the consonants of the root with different word patterns.  The different word patterns are classiﬁed into nominal word patterns and verbal words patterns that represent different grammatical categories such as agentive, passive adjective, passive verb, and active participle (for more examples, see Saiegh-Haddad & Henkin-Roitfarb, 2014).  To illustrate, the root /k t b/ with its general semantic ﬁeld “anything related to writing” when afﬁxed on different word patterns (with each dash representing the position of a root consonant), such as (-a-a-a), (-a. -i-), (-u-i-a), or (ma- - a-), yields the following distinct but semantically related words with different syntactic functions.  /kataba/ meaning “to write,” /ka. tib/ (“writer”), /kutiba/ (“was written”), and /maktab/ (“ofﬁce” or “desk”).  The root’s three consonants /k t b/ remain in the same order in all of the derivatives.  Preserving the sequence of these consonants has a morphological function (lexical access) and provides the general semantic ﬁeld, in this case “anything related to writing. ” Conversely, changing the order of the consonants changes the semantic ﬁeld.  For example, the word /kabata/ yields a different word meaning, “to suppress. ” In some cases, such a change may yield a pseudoword (e. g. ,takaba).  In contrast, when the same word pattern combines with different roots, the result is different words with similar syntactic functions, but completely different meanings.  For example, the pattern (-a-a-a) has the grammatical function of the verb “to do. ” When afﬁxed to different roots such as /d r s/, /k t b/, or /r s m/, the result is /darasa/, /kataba/, or /rasama/, meaning “to study,” “to write,” and “to draw,” respectively.  It has been reported that there are 5,336 roots and 2,324 word patterns in Standard Arabic (Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson, 2010).  The rootword pattern structure causes almost all Arabic words (with the exception of few function words) to be at least bimorphemic.  Some roots are highly productive allowing for many words to be derived from them.  In addition to the inﬂectional and derivational systems of Arabic morphology, there is another group of morphemes referred to as clitics, which Saiegh-Haddad and Henkin-Roitfarb (2014) described as “grammatically independent, but phonologically dependent on another word or phrase.  .  .  .  Clitics may attach to the word .  .  .  and can co-occur within the same word, resulting in one-word phrases and clauses” (p.  14).  For example, the one-word clause /bimadrasatihi/ “in his school” includes the preﬁx /bi/ “in,” /madrasat/ “school,” and “hi/ referring to the sufﬁx that means “his. ” The complexity of Arabic morphology being both linear and nonlinear requires the Arabic reader to process its morphology by means of composition and decomposition processes to attain comprehension (Boudelaa, 2014.  Boudelaa et al. , 2010).  In the composition process, the Arabic learner applies different patterns to the root in order to derive different words.  In the decomposition process, the learner extracts the root from the polymorphemic word to derive the meaning.  Both processes are important and natural for the advanced learner.  Frost, Kugler, Deutsch, and Forster (2005) found that morphological priming was far more robust than orthographic priming in Hebrew and Arabic.  Boudelaa (2015) provided evidence from two cross-modal priming experiments that Arabic learners rely mainly on the root in accessing meaning.  He found that the consonants that belong to the root were more effective primes than the vowels of the word patterns.  Boudelaa concluded that the roots and word patterns in Arabic have distinct representational and processing properties.  Similarly, Ussishkin, Dawson, Wedel, and Schluter (2015) found that the consonantal root facilitated priming in spoken-word recognition in Maltese, another Semitic language.  The predominance of the root-word pattern morphological structure in Arabic words has been shown to play a key role in reading accuracy and comprehension among normal and dyslexic Arabic readers across different age groups (AbuRabia, 2007.  Abu-Rabia, Share, & Mansour, 2003.  Abu-Rabia & Taha, 2004) and in spelling (Saiegh-Haddad, 2013).  Abu-Rabia (2007) compared typically developing and dyslexic Palestinian students in Grades 3, 6, 9, and 12 and found that, within groups and across grade levels, performance on an orthographic morphology task was a robust, and often the sole, predictor of word recognition accuracy and reading comprehension in vowelized texts.  In a previous study, Abu-Rabia et al.  (2003) compared reading-disabled and normal readers of the same chronological age (9. 5–10. 5 years), and younger normal readers (7. 5–8. 5 years) at the same reading level as the reading disabled children.  They found that the readingdisabled children performed poorly on the morphological measures, and their overall performance was signiﬁcantly poorer than that of the other groups.  After phonological awareness, morphology was the strongest predictor.  Saiegh-Haddad (2013) found that Grade 1 Arabic-speaking students made use of morphology while doing a spelling task.  For example, spelling accuracy with the letter <t> increased when the <t> was part of the root as opposed to part of the word pattern (e. g. , present tense preﬁx).  <Middle> THE CURRENT STUDY.  Considering the relative lack of research on Arabic MA and reading, especially among children, the importance of morphology in the Arabic lexical structure, and the speciﬁc linguistic nature of Arabic (e. g. , differences between spoken and Standard Arabic, and differences between the root and word patterns), we set out to investigate the dimensionality of Arabic MA and its role in reading Arabic with native Arabic-speaking Grade 3 children.  Examining morphological awareness in Arabic may reveal new insight because of its varied types of morphology (linear and nonlinear), and because its words are formed mostly through derivational processes.  Furthermore, the diglossic situation of Arabic makes it different from other languages investigated so far.  It is also important to note that the available studies on Arabic processes of reading have included a relatively small sample (sometimes not from an Arabic population), examined older students only, used a limited number of morphological tasks, or dealt with adults only in priming experiments.  None of the Arabic studies has examined the performance of typical Arabic-speaking children living in an Arabic country on a wide range of measures capturing all domains of morphology in addition to reading measures.  More important, none of the available studies on Arabic morphology has attempted to examine the underlying nature of morphological knowledge in Arabic.  Our reasons for studying Arabic are, ﬁrst, to extend the MA literature, and second, to capitalize on key features of Arabic concerning morphology and its potential relationship to reading.  The mounting evidence on the strong relationship between morphological awareness and reading motivated us to explore this relationship in Arabic, particularly because Arabic combines linear and nonlinear morphology and plays a central role in forming its words.  Therefore, the present study investigates the following research questions.  1.  What dimensions underlie morphological awareness in Arabic.  2.  Does morphological awareness predict the reading ability of Arabic-speaking children, and if so, how well.  To answer the ﬁrst question, we developed 10 MA tasks in Arabic covering a wide range of dimensions (Deacon et al. , 2008), and examined their dimensionality through exploratory factor analysis.  An exploratory analysis was conducted because there were many plausible alternative structures and little guidance was provided by prior research regarding constructs and construct validity.  We used Deacon et al. ’s taxonomy to construct a set of 10 MA tests that varied in several dimensions.  In designing the tasks, we took into consideration the morphological structure of Arabic (e. g. , root vs.  word pattern), and inﬂectional versus derivational processes.  We included a variety of different consonantal roots and different word patterns covering a wide range of grammatical functions and different inﬂectional and derivational processes in each measure.  Because Arabic is diglossic in nature, it was possible to assess children on an oral task in their own dialect.  Including an oral task may shed light on the nature of dimensionality in Arabic MA.  For example, are there two dimensions, dialect versus standard.  The same applies to including both written and oral tasks in the sense that oral versus written dimensions could emerge.  To answer the second research question, we developed two reading tests (words and pseudowords), and due to the central function of morphology in forming Arabic words, we investigated the relationship between MA and reading (predictive validity). Participants.  Participants were 102 Arabic-speaking children (51 girls.  mean age = 104 months, SD = 5. 7 months) recruited from three public schools in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  All children in Grade 3 in the participating schools were invited to participate.  Only the children with parental consent and child assent were tested.  the participation rate was 60%.  All children were assessed informally for any signs of developmental impairment by the ﬁrst author.  All children with any sign of hearing or cognitive impairment were excluded from participation in this study.  All participants were native Arabic-speaking Emirati children with both parents being native speakers of Arabic, and were tested at the end of Grade 3.  All children were learning Standard Arabic as a core subject in their curriculum.  In addition, the children were studying English, mathematics, and science in English.  Although these children had started studying English in Grade 1, their knowledge of English was at best rudimentary.  Possible reasons for this are that their exposure to English is limited to the class periods, many of the teachers who teach these subjects are not native English speakers, and lack of access to peers who are native or near native English speakers (only Emirati children attend government schools in UAE).  The only mode of communication in the children’s homes is also Arabic.  Therefore, considering the factors proposed by Paradis, Genesee, and Crago (2011.  i. e. , the majority language, ethnolinguistic community, and time of exposure), we see the sample as primarily Arabic speaking.  Procedure.  Children completed a series of tasks administered individually by the ﬁrst author (who is a native speaker of Arabic) in a quiet room in their school.  Task administration for each child was broken up into two sessions, 30 min each.  The ﬁrst session included the word reading test and the six oral MA tests.  The second session included the pseudoword reading test and the four written MA tests.  In the written tests, children were instructed to carefully read the sentences presented in print and were given a pencil to use for writing or circling the correct choice.  All tests were preceded by practice items (four for MA tests and three for reading measures) to ensure that children understood the task.  during the practice items, corrective feedback was given if needed.  All instructions were given in the Emirati dialect, though the content of most tests was in Standard Arabic.  All assessments and contacts with the children were exclusively in Arabic.  Measures.  We developed 10 MA tasks covering the dimensions addressed in the Deacon et al.  (2008) taxonomy and other relevant factors (see Table 1).  Four of the tasks were presented in vowelized print and required the participants to read and write or circle the correct answer.  The other 6 MA tasks were presented orally and required the child to either provide an oral answer or to say Yes or No.  Nine out of the 10 MA tests were in Standard Arabic, whereas the 1 MA test was in the local Emirati dialect.  The termination rule for each MA task was 4 consecutive errors, for word reading 10 consecutive errors, and for pseudoword reading 4 consecutive errors.  To address as many types of morphological process as possible, we included items within each test that varied in the degrees of transparency/opacity of phonology, orthography, and semantics.  Furthermore, all measures involved both inﬂections and derivations, though these were not included as separate scales.  We also included both linear and nonlinear morphology items.  We explicitly included two variations of the word analogy task, one in Standard Arabic and one in the local dialect to examine the diglossia issue.  In all multiple-choice tasks, the position of correct answers was varied randomly.
