The remediation of misarticulations in children’s speech has been a core part of speech-language pathology practice since the earliest days of the profession (Van Riper,  []), and the treatment of unintelligible speech remains a prominent function of the speech-language pathologist (Schooling, ).  However, treatment approaches are more efficient now that we understand that the underlying nature of the problem is considerably more complex than “persistence of faulty habits of articulation” (Morley, , p.  ).  Modern conceptualizations of speech sound disorders, such as the Speech Disorders Classification System (Shriberg, .  Shriberg, Austin, Lewis, McSweeny & Wilson, .  Shriberg et al. , .  Shriberg, Lewis, Tomblin, McSweeny, Karlsson & Scheer, .  Shriberg, Lohmeier, Strand & Jakielski, ) recognize multiple distal and proximal causes that explain the observed heterogeneity in clinical typology.  Specifically, speech characteristics vary greatly between children with speech sound disorders as well as within children across developmental time.  In terms of distal causes, environmental risk and protective factors interact with the genotype, to produce varying trajectories of speech development.
