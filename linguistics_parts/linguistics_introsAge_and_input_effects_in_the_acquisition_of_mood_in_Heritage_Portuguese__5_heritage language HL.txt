INTRODUCTION.  The acquisition of heritage languages, i. e.  minority languages acquired in a migration context, has been a matter of debate in recent literature.  Heritage speakers (HSs) acquire two (or more) languages in childhood and thus the acquisition of a heritage language (HL) is an instance of bilingual acquisition.  HSs are either simultaneous bilinguals, if they are exposed to the minority and the majority language from birth, or successive bilinguals, if contact with the majority language occurs after extensive exposure to the family (heritage) language.
