Human communication involves linguistic knowledge (grammar, lexicon, and sound structure), as well as knowledge about the context within which it is used (what can be inferred about the speaker’s intentions, etc. ).  This latter type of knowledge, pragmatics, has received considerable attention in studies on autism, and impairment in this domain is considered a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD.  see Baron-Cohen, 1988.  Boucher, 2003).  By contrast, formal aspects of language (those concerning sound, word, and sentence structure) have been much less investigated in ASD, especially in languages other than English.  This is despite consensus among scholars regarding the existence of frequent formal language impairment in children with ASD (for overviews, see Boucher, 2012.  Eigsti, de Marchena, Schuh, & Kelley, 2011.  and Groen, Zwiers, Van der Gaag, & Buitelaar, 2008), though rates and underlying nature of this impairment have been understudied.  Recent work has brought this issue to the forefront in the context of the question of whether the language difﬁculties observed in some children with ASD are similar to those found in children with speciﬁc language impairment (SLI.  for a review, see Williams, Botting, & Boucher, 2008). 1 Moreover, it has been suggested that an “inverse” production–comprehension dissociation characterizes language in children with ASD, with comprehension difﬁculties overshadowing production difﬁculties (for a review, see Boucher, 2012), and persistence of comprehension problems constituting a signiﬁcant difference with SLI (Rutter, Mawhood, & Howlin, 1992), though the validity of this characterization remains unclear (Kwok, Brown, Smyth, & Cardy, 2015).  This paper aims to contribute to this inquiry with a study comparing children with ASD to children with SLI on alternative ways of forming wh-questions in French.
