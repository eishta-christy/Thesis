Introduction.  Children’s first word forms have been found to be very similar across languages, with minor ambient language effects (Boysson-Bardies & Vihman, .  Vihman, Kay, Boysson-Bardies, Durand & Sundberg, ).  This similarity in production can be ascribed to infants’ limited articulatory skills (Davis & MacNeilage, ) and experience (Vihman, ).  As children move into regular word production, however, cross-linguistic differences are observed (Stoel-Gammon, Williams & Buder, .  Buder & Stoel-Gammon, .  Vihman, , ).  One early-emerging difference, for example, is the production of long consonants or, where consonantal length plays a phonologically contrastive role, GEMINATES (which nevertheless need not be in any sense contrastive for the children).  Because child production is relatively slow or sluggish (Smith, .  Payne, Post, Astruc, Prieto & Vanrell, ), long medial consonants can readily be heard (and measured) in the first words, even in the case of children exposed only to languages like English or French, where they are not contrastive and in fact rarely occur at all (Vihman & Velleman, ).  To illustrate this, analysis of the word forms produced by five children each at the time of first word use (termed the -WORD POINT [wp].  the first -minute recording session in which at least four different spontaneously produced words can be identified.  mean age . · for the American and French infants, .  for the Finnish infants) revealed a mean consonant length for English of  ms (s. d.  ·), for French,  ms (s. d.  ·), and for Finnish, with its contrastive consonant length,  ms (s. d.  ) (Vihman & Velleman, ).  As the children gain production skills and productive lexical knowledge of their language, however, the duration of medial consonants drops significantly in languages with no phonological contrast in consonant length.  Thus, at the end of the single-word period (-WORD POINT [wp].  mean age .  for the American infants, .  for the French, .  for the Finnish), the mean medial-consonant duration for the same five children learning English was  ms and for those learning French,  ms, with a drop in variability within each group as well (s. d.  for English, ·, for French, ·).  at the same time, medial consonants became longer and intra-group variability increased for the five Finnish children (mean  ms, s. d.  ·).  In fact, in languages with geminates the use and overuse of these long consonants (i. e.  their production even for singleton targets) is consistently reported for the single-word period (see, for Arabic.  Khattab & Al-Tamimi, .  for Estonian.  Vihman, .  for Finnish.  Kunnari, .  Savinainen-Makkonen, a, b, , .  for Hindi.  Bhaya Nair, .  for Italian.  Keren-Portnoy, Majorano & Vihman, .  Majorano, Rainieri & Corsano .  and for Japanese.  Kunnari, Nakai & Vihman, .  Ota, ).  Finally, children learning Welsh, with its (phonetic) accentual lengthening of consonants, also make heavy use of long medial consonants in their early words (Vihman, Nakai & DePaolis, ), although no significant increase in mean medial consonant duration is seen in this case over the period of single word use (Vihman & Kunnari, ), presumably because long consonants are not lexically contrastive in Welsh.  That is, where consonant duration is a (non-contrastive) concomitant of the accentual pattern, its frequency of occurrence may be variable but should be consistently so over time and development.  Where it is lexically tied, infants’ increasing lexical knowledge results in a steady increase in representations of words with geminates.  Thus, contrastive child use, as seen in Finnish, appears to be mediated by lexical advance.  Examples of early words produced with long medial consonants in Arabic, Estonian, Finnish, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, and Welsh are presented in Table , where SELECTED (or more or less accurately produced words) have a long consonant in the adult target as well as in the child form, whereas ADAPTED words (modified to fit one of the child’s favored production patterns) display ‘overuse’ of geminates.  Here we observe that in their production of long consonants children may replace a VV sequence by CC (see both Martin’s word form for Arabic ba. ba and Kaia’s form for Estonian auto), omit the onset consonant (as in Joel’s word for Finnish loppu.  cf.  also the Hindi and Japanese examples), ‘demote’ an onset consonant (replacing a supraglottal by a glottal segment.  Fflur, Welsh example), or retain the length feature while changing the segmental quality (and word length) to fit a consonant-harmony constraint (as in Anna’s word for Italian cavallo).  Interestingly, in most of these languages child overuse of the prosodic word shape <VCCV> can be observed (as in the examples from Joel, V, Haruo, and Fflur.  Table ), even when the adult target form includes an early-learned onset consonant such as a labial or coronal stop and the word is accentually trochaic (strong–weak accent), so that the omitted initial consonant is part of the accented syllable.  In fact, Vihman and Velleman () report that % of the tokens produced by five Finnish children at the wp were of the shape <VCCV>.  Savinainen-Makkonen (), similarly, reports use of <VC(C)V> as an idiosyncratic child pattern or TEMPLATE in both selected and adapted words in her case study of the Finnish child Joel.  anna ‘give’ [ɑn. ɑ], vettä ‘water’ [et. æ], tippu ‘fell’ [ip. o], lusikas ‘spoon’ [uki], nammi ‘candy/yummy’ [ɑmi], [mɑmi], [mɑm. i], nostaa ‘carry’ [ot. ɑ. ] (cf.  also Savinainen-Makkonen, b).  The frequent occurrence of the <VC(C)V> pattern in Finnish child forms is all the more striking since the corresponding pattern – VCV, with omitted onset consonant – is rare in the early word forms of children learning (primarily trochaic) English (Savinainen-Makkonen, b.  Vihman & Croft, ), although not in those of children learning final-syllableaccented French (Wauquier & Yamaguchi, ) or primarily iambic (weak–strong) Hebrew (Keren-Portnoy & Segal, in press).  This suggests that, in addition to the ease of articulation of geminates (due to the slow rate of early speech production), their greater segmental duration may make them particularly salient to children, which in turn might draw attention away from the onset consonant, as suggested by SavinainenMakkonen (b).  This would be in accord with the WHOLE-WORD PHONOLOGY account, which argues that children’s early words reflect child memory for the word as a whole, with production of certain salient elements, such as the accented syllable, at the expense of other aspects (Vihman, Nakai, DePaolis & Hallé, .  Vihman & Croft, ).  The whole-word phonology model (Vihman & Keren-Portnoy, a) provides a usage- and exemplar-based perspective on phonological development that contrasts with linear, stage-like approaches that depend on Universal Grammar and parameter setting or markedness-constraint ranking to account for knowledge of linguistic structure (e. g.  Kager, Pater & Zonneveld, .  Demuth, Culbertson & Alter, ).  According to the whole-word phonology model, initial item learning, which targets ‘easy’ words and involves relatively accurate production, is followed by implicit ‘secondary’ distributional learning of the patterns inherent in the child’s own first word forms (see Vihman, , Ch.  ).  In other words, once the child has produced a small collection of different words, she begins to implicitly pick up on the patterns inherent in those words, which reflect both the ambient language structures and the child’s own starting point, commonly rooted in babbling experience (e. g.  Vihman, Macken, Miller, Simmons & Miller, ).  Implicit learning of patterns that become salient through a child’s own production experience typically leads to a regression in accuracy (and so to a non-linear developmental path).  Regression in accuracy is the result of the child generalizing the structural patterns inherent in the word forms they are using.  The resultant patterns appear to constitute (unconscious or implicit) child responses to the phonological challenges posed by target word forms.  In other words, the child’s existing resources (familiar production routines) are deployed to deal with what is novel and thus difficult to bring to mind, plan, and produce as needed (Vihman & Keren-Portnoy, b, p.  ).  At the same time, when children learn languages like Arabic or Finnish, which contrast long and short (geminate and singleton) consonants, expressive lexical advance must play a key role in the acquisition of the structural contrast in medial consonant duration.  In this study we test Savinainen-Makkonen’s hypothesis regarding the salience of geminates and the effect of that salience on the shape of early word forms by analyzing data from the acquisition of Italian, through both observational production and experimental perception studies.  We focus on three research questions.  .  Will the frequency of occurrence of geminates in words used in child-directed speech be mirrored or accentuated in child selection of words to attempt or in their early word forms.  .  Do Italian children tend to omit word-initial consonants particularly in words with medial geminates.  .  Will perception experiments provide corroborating evidence of an effect of medial geminates on children’s attention to the word-initial consonant.  If so, this may be interpreted as evidence in favor of whole-word phonology, inasmuch as a segmental feature occurring later in the word is seen to affect infant processing of the beginning of theWe begin by considering the effect of geminates on child production in a study of thirty children seen with their parents for two recording sessions, at .  and .  (Study ).  We then test the last research question directly in three experiments involving untrained word-form recognition in -month-olds (Study ).  <Middle> STUDY .
