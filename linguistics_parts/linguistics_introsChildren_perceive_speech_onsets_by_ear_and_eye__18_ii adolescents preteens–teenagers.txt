I N T R O D U C T I O N.  In everyday conversations adults perceive speech by ear and eye, yet the development of this critical audiovisual property of speech perception is still not well understood.  In fact, the extant child research reveals that – compared to adults – children exhibit reduced sensitivity to the articulatory gestures of talkers (i. e.  visual speech).  The McGurk task (McGurk & MacDonald, ) well illustrates this maturational diﬀerence in sensitivity to visual speech.  In this task, individuals are presented with audiovisual stimuli with conﬂicting auditory and visual onsets (e. g.  hear /ba/ and see /ga/).  Whereas adults typically perceive a blend of the auditory and visual inputs (e. g.  /da/ or /ða/) and rarely report perceiving the auditory /ba/, children, by contrast, report perceiving the /ba/ (auditory capture) % to % of the time (McGurk & MacDonald, ).  Because visual speech plays a role in learning the phonological structure of spoken language (e. g.  Locke, .  Mills, ), it is critical to understand how children utilize visual speech cues.  The influence of visual speech on children’s audiovisual speech perception clearly increases with age, but the precise timecourse for achieving adultlike benefit from visual speech remains unclear.  Numerous studies report that (i) children from roughly five through eleven years of age benefit less than adults from visual speech whereas (ii) adolescents (preteens–teenagers) show an adultlike visual speech advantage (e. g.
