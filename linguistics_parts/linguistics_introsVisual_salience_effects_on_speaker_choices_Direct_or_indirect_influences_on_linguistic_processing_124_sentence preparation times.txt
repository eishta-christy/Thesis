 When speakers talk, they are normally trying to give linguistic form to a notion they have in their heads that they wish to implant in their interlocutors’ heads.  Insofar as speakers can and do describe things that they are seeing either at that very moment or with their minds’ eyes, it is logical to think that visual characteristics will have an inﬂuence on speaker choices regarding most obviously the content, but also the ﬁnal form of their descriptive utterances.  Vision has been found to inﬂuence language in many ways.  For example, a character who is looked at ﬁrst for perceptual reasons is more likely to be mentioned ﬁrst (e. g. , Gleitman, January, Nappa, & Trueswell, 2007.  Myachykov, Garrod, & Scheepers, 2012.  Myachykov, Thompson, Garrod, & Scheepers, 2011).  looks to characters in an image have been consistently found to predict mention of the ﬁxated characters (e. g. , Coco & Keller, 2012.  Coco, Malcolm, & Keller, 2014.  Grifﬁn, 2001) and their properties (Haskell, 2005.  Meyer, van der Meulen, & Brooks, 2004.  van der Meulen, 2001).  and visual content inﬂuences choice of referring expression (Fukumura, van Gompel, & Pickering, 2010).  However, speakers are not always describing a scene, and even when they are, some of the information conveyed is not straightfordwardly attributable to something the speakers perceive or have a perceptual memory of.  Moreover, the information derived from the visual system is unlikely to be in a format that can be directly transferred to the linguistic system.  Some kind of translation is required (Jackendoff, 1987).  In short, the blueprints for sentences are likely to come from a conceptual representation of the perceived event, rather than from the perceived event itself (Bunger, Papafragou, & Trueswell, 2013.  Vogels, Krahmer, & Maes, 2013).  Although most researchers will probably agree with the previous statement, some explanations of perceptual inﬂuences on language production seem to either disregard the existence of an intermediate level of event conceptualization or confound it with sentence preparation under the implicit assumption that what you see is what you say (Ibbotson, Lieven, & Tomasello, 2013.  Montag & MacDonald, 2013.  Myachykov et al. , 2012.  Myachykov, Thompson, et al. , 2011), rather than determining what you may want to say.  More speciﬁcally, looks to elements in a scene are linked directly with the building blocks of sentence production rather than with the way the scene is apprehended (see, e. g. , Myachykov, Posner, & Tomlin, 2007, p.  464, their ﬁgure 2.  Myachykov, Thompson, Garrod, et al. , 2011).  In consequence, the fact that speakers’ gazes are drawn to a speciﬁc object and this object is then chosen as the syntactic subject of the ﬁnal description is taken to mean that the starting point in sentence production is a lexical item rather than a syntactic frame (Gleitman et al. , 2007.  for a detailed description of the “syntactic planning starting point” debate, see Bock, Irwin, & Davidson, 2004).  In truth, however, even when perceptual salience correlates with choice of starting point in a sentence, it is possible that the perceptual properties are inﬂuencing how the event is conceptualized rather than linguistic planning directly (Vogels et al. , 2013).  Cueing a participant in a scene may be one way of anchoring the way the event is interpreted, which could make the cued character then become the topic of the linguistic message, what Bock and Ferreira (2014) call the “aboutee,” and thus be the ﬁrst mentioned noun by virtue of its conferred conceptual status.  This would be similar to the special status conferred by other conceptual properties such as animacy, which also inﬂuences linguistic choices (Ant´on-M´endez, Gerfen, & Ramos, 2016.  Branigan, Pickering, & Tanaka, 2008.  Brawley, 2012.  Hickmann, Taranne, & Bonnet, 2009.  Prat-Sala & Branigan, 2000).  To determine which of the two mechanisms, scene conceptualization or lexical activation, is responsible for the observed effects of visual salience on linguistic output, it would be necessary to pitch the visual manipulation against another manipulation thought to affect at least one of these two levels of processing.  for example, a linguistic prime.  Myachykov et al.  (2012) conducted such an investigation.  In their Experiments 1 and 2, the researchers looked at the proportion of active descriptions of depicted transitive events (e. g. , a cowboy punching a boxer) after a linguistic prime consisting of either a matching or a nonmatching verb (e. g. , punch vs.  kiss), and a visual prime in the form of a dot directing attention to the location of one of the two characters prior to the image appearing on screen.  They found that visually cueing the agent of the event (e. g. , the cowboy) increased the proportion of active descriptions but only when the linguistic prime was the nonmatching irrelevant verb (e. g. , kiss).  For the authors, this interaction points to the effect of perceptual manipulations on syntactic choice over and above the effect of a verbal prime.  There is an alternative interpretation of these results, however, since there was an imbalance between the two kinds of priming in Myachykov et al. ’s design.  the visual manipulation primed one or the other participants in an unambiguous event, but the linguistic one either primed or did not prime the event.  The interaction could thus be due to the visual cue having an effect only in the absence of a “useful” linguistic one, while when there is a matching linguistic prime, the visual cue did not make any difference.  To create a more balanced design, the scenes to be described should allow linguistic priming in both directions, something that can best be achieved by the use of perspective predicates (Gleitman et al. , 2007).  To investigate whether perceptual manipulations inﬂuence sentence production directly through lexical access, the following experiments were designed to look for the effects that visual salience would have on sentence production if it inﬂuenced linguistic processing directly by determining order or mention or argument assignment.  Speciﬁcally, the experiments looked for the effects of visual priming on scenes that can be described from two complementary perspectives (e. g. , a chasing event is also a ﬂeeing event), in the presence of a linguistic prime.  The linguistic priming consisted of a verb associated with one of the two perspectives of the event to be described (e. g. , either “chase” or “ﬂee”), which should inﬂuence descriptions by biasing the speaker toward the associated conceptualization of the event (i. e. , reading the word “chase” should make the reader think in terms of chasing and interpret the coming scene from that perspective).  and the visual priming consisted of a preview of one of the two characters involved in the event (e. g. , the robber or the cop in a chase scene being shown ahead of the full scene), which draws the eyes to ﬁrst land on the intended character when the complete scene appears.  <Middle> PREDICTIONS.  A scene depicting a cop chasing a robber who is ﬂeeing (see Figure 1) can be described in one of two main ways.  as a regular active sentence from a chasing perspective (e. g. , “the cop is chasing the robber”) or from a ﬂeeing perspective (e. g. , “the robber is ﬂeeing from the cop”).  In addition, speakers may also choose to describe the scene using either a passive sentence (e. g. , “the robber is being chased by the cop”), or a sentence where the direct object has been placed in a more prominent position (e. g. , “the robber, the cop is chasing him”).  Which of these forms gets chosen should depend on whether the speaker is already primed to think about or construe the scene as a chasing or ﬂeeing event after encountering one of the two verbs.  Assuming incremental sentence production (see review of lexicalist frameworks in Bock et al. , 2004.  Kempen & Hoenkamp, 1987.  Levelt, 1989), characters who are more visually salient and therefore are made more accessible should tend to dictate how to describe the scene in which they appear by being processed earlier and, thus, determining the sentence’s starting point, as has been found (e. g. , Gleitman et al. , 2007.  Prat-Sala & Branigan, 2000).  In Experiment 1, the scenes to be described are preceded by either a linguistic or a visual prime, but not both, to test the predicted inﬂuences of each type of prime on description choice.  In particular, a linguistic prime that is known to always match the scene to be described should create an expectation of what the coming scene will be about and, thus, shape the linguistic intention of how to describe it (Myachykov et al. , 2012).  Therefore, a linguistic prime on its own should inﬂuence how the scene is construed (as a chasing or a ﬂeeing event) and how often it is described from the associated perspective.  that is, there should be more chase descriptions when “chase” is the prime than when “ﬂee” is the prime.  In the case of visual primes, they are also expected to inﬂuence the choice of descriptions by either (a) making the associated lexical item more accessible to start with (Gleitman et al. , 2007.  Myachykov et al. , 2007, p.  469) and thus more likely to be mentioned early.  or (b) promoting the salient entity to a syntactically prominent position such as subject (Tanaka, Branigan, McLean, & Pickering, 2011.  Tomlin, 1997).  In the case of active sentences, both possibilities would result in the same kind of description.  one in which the visually primed character is expected to be the subject.  Therefore, under conditions that do not promote alternative sentence structures, more chase descriptions would be expected after visually priming the cop than after visually priming the robber.  Furthermore, when each prime type is acting independently, we do not expect a difference in the time needed to start speaking depending on the priming direction (i. e. , whether the linguistic prime is “chase” vs.  “ﬂee,” or whether the cop or the robber is visually primed) as there is no reason to believe that one of the priming directions carries any advantage over the other in terms of lexical access or facilitating sentence preparation.  In Experiment 2, the two types of primes are combined to answer the main research question.  whether perceptual salience has a direct effect on linguistic processing by determining a sentence’s starting point.  If the visual prime affects lexical accessibility while the linguistic prime acts by promoting one of the two construals of the scene, the two inﬂuences could be accommodated in the eventual verbal description.  a referent made more accessible could be processed ﬁrst and should, at any rate, affect the time needed for sentence preparation (Smith & Wheeldon, 1999.  Wheeldon, Ohlson, Ashby, & Gator, 2013).  This means that, at the very least, visually priming the cop should result in shorter sentence preparation times when the speaker is preparing a congruent chase description due to the linguistic prime favoring a chasing construal, but in longer preparation times when the speaker is preparing an incongruent ﬂee description because the linguistic prime favors a ﬂeeing construal. 1 Therefore, a statistical interaction would be expected for sentence preparation times because the direction of priming of the visual cue would be associated with opposite effects depending on the direction of the linguistic prime.
