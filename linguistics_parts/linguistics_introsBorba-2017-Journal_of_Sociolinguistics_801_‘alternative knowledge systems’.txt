INTRODUCTION.  Until 1997, the healthcare needs of Brazilian transsexual people received little to no attention from the public health system (Sistema Unico de Saude – SUS).  Indeed, one of their main healthcare concerns, i. e.  sex reassignment surgeries, was regarded as a crime of mutilation by the Federal Board of Medicine (FBM).  This changed, however, with the publication of FBM Resolution 1. 482/97, in which sex reassignment surgeries were allowed to be performed as an experimental ‘treatment’ to resolve transsexual individuals’ dissatisfaction with their morphological sex.  Since then, the regulation for Brazilian transspecific healthcare policies has undergone constant revision.  The most recent governmental documents regulating gender identity clinics in the country are the Ministry of Health Decree 2. 803/2013 and the FBM Resolution 1. 955/ 2010.  the former institutionalizes the Brazilian Transsexualizing Process (‘Processo Transexualizador’) within the SUS and allows the government to subsidize surgeries and hormone therapies.  the latter revises previous resolutions and more clearly defines the FBM’s viewpoints on transsexuality and its medical management.  According to the Brazilian documents, ‘the transsexual patient has a permanent psychological disorder and [because of this] rejects his/her phenotype and tends to self-mutilate and/or commit suicide’ (Brasil 2010).  Due to their pathologized status, transsexual people who wish to have their healthcare subsidized by the State must be diagnosed as suffering from a Gender Identity Disorder (GID) – a term coined by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in the fourth version of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). 2 Thus, it is a psychiatric diagnosis which guides Brazilian trans-specific healthcare policies and, as a consequence, informs the interactions between transsexual people at gender identity clinics and their doctors.  Interestingly, though, the Brazilian documents never mention the DSM as a diagnostic resource.  However, fieldwork in one of the Brazilian gender clinics has shown that it is the APA’s diagnostic criteria which guide doctors’ clinical gaze (Foucault 2001) when talking to a transsexual person.  In this scenario, the medical management of transsexual individuals at Brazilian public hospitals provides an analytical avenue for the sociolinguistic critique of a macro-sociological process the editors of this Special Issue allude to in their introduction, namely discursive colonization.  This concept refers to the ease and rapidity with which certain authoritative Western discursive frameworks and their respective texts circulate globally and end up imposing ex-centric (Bhabha 1994) institutional standards of textuality by which the global South must comply, obliterating, thus, local culture-specific discourses, practices and subjectivities.  In this context, the first aim of this paper is to critically assess the epistemological dynamics which make the global circulation of the APA manual possible.  The centrality of this diagnostic text is also relevant for our understanding of how interactions between doctors and transsexual people unfold, and, most significantly, how identity (de)legitimation is interactionally negotiated in these ex-centric, globalized terms.  In fact, the necessity of a psychiatric diagnosis within the APA’s terms imposes interactional tensions.  As argued by Teixeira (2013), for example, the GID diagnosis is the result of discursive strategies deployed by clinic users to convince doctors they fit the diagnostic criteria.  In this scenario, worried they will be denied access to the clinic services, transsexual clients rapidly learn ‘the necessary life-history required for successful “passing”’ (Hird 2002.  583).  Although the learning and the telling of an adequate narrative is frequently referred to in the literature which analyses the little resonance such diagnostic criteria have in transsexual people’s lives (Butler 2004.  Bento 2006.  Stone 2007 [1991].  Teixeira 2013), these analyses are largely based on secondhand, retrospective accounts of transsexual people about their experiences with doctors.  As such, little do we know of the interactional in situ instantiation of such ‘adequate narrative’, let alone the learning trajectory that leads to the narrative shape, content, and pragmatic effects.  Understanding the micro-interactional processes that lead to the materialization of such text-based, diagnostically driven, ex-centric narrative standards is the second aim of this paper.  Within language and gender studies, research on interactions between health professionals and transsexual people has been developed by Susan Speer (Speer 2009, 2010, 2011).  However, Speer’s allegiance to conversation analysis’s (CA) understanding of context as co-text (Billig 1999), and focus on what members explicitly orient to, impel her to take the status of transsexuality as a mental disorder for granted.  As such, her CA studies overlook the centrality of the diagnostic manuals to the relationships within the gender clinic she investigates.  Needless to say, transsexual clients will hardly ever admit to their doctors they are familiar with the diagnostic texts.  Physicians, in turn, will seldom tell their interlocutors they perceive the rehearsed quality of the narratives (Maryns 2006) of ‘true’ transsexuality and grow intensely suspicious of what the clients say.  This is testimony to the fact that the diagnostic texts may be regarded as an absent presence in these interactions.  indeed, they constitute a ‘ghost audience’ (Langellier 2001) which constrains the social actions of both transsexual people and their doctors.  In order to understand the role of these ex-centric diagnostic criteria in the relationships between health professionals and transsexual people, we must take into account the dynamics between what Goffman (1959) refers to as onstage and backstage performances.  In other words, we need to compare and contrast what happens in consultations (i. e.  their turn-by-turn interactional development) and the interlocutors’ attitudes and opinions about these interactions which are shared outside the consultation room.  The analytical enterprise, as Fabrıcio (2013.  146) puts it, is a task of ethnographically tracking down the textual webs that make visible ‘how social actors experience and reconstruct [their membership to social categories] in their everyday discursive practices’.  This kind of textual cartography involves looking into the macro-sociological dynamics which allow certain discourses to materialize as travelling texts (Blommaert 2005), i. e.  ones invested with the power and authority to circulate globally almost without contestation, and the effects of these itineraries in the micro-details of people’s daily institutional lives.  Having this in mind, the discussion in this paper is grounded in 13 months of ethnographic fieldwork at the Programa de Atenc~ao Integral a Saude Transexual (PAIST).  It investigates the intersubjective effects of the importation of the DSM diagnostic criteria, their standards of textuality, and narrative resources in the lives of transsexual people and their doctors.  During fieldwork, the PAIST had three main health professionals (a surgeon, a psychologist, and a psychiatrist) and two visiting physicians who were specializing in urological surgeries.  Here, specifically, I present a case study of one of the research participants’ first contacts with the PAIST to highlight the discursive processes that lead her to locally refashion her life history within the textual modes of the DSM.  As the analyses show, the necessity of such a narrative refashioning exemplifies the ex-centricity of such medical texts within the Brazilian context.  This will lead me to.  (1) discuss the intersubjective effects of such narrative refashioning on the clinic users’ situated relationships with their doctors.  and (2) reflect on the possibilities of a sociolinguistics from the South, i. e.  an approach to discourse and interaction that takes discursive colonization and its local effects seriously.  <Middle> TRAVELLING TEXTS AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL IMBALANCES.  A CRITIQUE FROM/ABOUT THE SOUTH.  The DSM-IVR is described as a ‘helpful guide to medical practice’ which provides ‘brevity of criteria sets, clarity of language, and explicit statements of the constructs embodied in the diagnostic criteria’ (American Psychiatric Association 1994.  xv) and is thus regarded as a useful guide to clinical practice among psychiatrists.  However, one needs to problematize the epistemological and political processes that transform this manual into a highly mobile text (Blommaert 2010) which is able to shape healthcare policies around the globe.  To a great extent, but not exclusively, two interrelated socio-cultural and discursive dynamics contribute to the global itinerary of this text and constitute a process Briggs (2005) describes as the globalization of medical epistemologies.  (1) the medicalization of society.  and (2) epistemological colonization produced by what Connell (2007) and Grosfoghel (2011) refer to as the universalizing tendencies of ‘Western’ theories.  ‘[M]edicalization describes a process by which nonmedical problems become defined and treated as medical problems, usually in terms of illness and disorders’ (Conrad 2007.  4).  This is the case in transsexuality, but it is not restricted to it.  A number of human experiences have also been medicalized, such as baldness, menstruation, hyperactivity, ageing, etc.  Conrad argues that medicalization is a form of social control.  by redefining such life experiences in medical terms and imposing treatment procedures, a line between what is normal and healthy and what is abnormal and, thus, unhealthy, is drawn.  This, in turn, gives medicine the power to prescribe which human experiences, subjectivities and bodies are deemed appropriate.  In this scenario, the DSM is both constituted by and constitutive of such medico-social processes.  On the one hand, it reflects these broader social dynamics.  on the other, it performatively produces (new) disorders and foments their medical surveillance.  The publication of the DSM-V in 2012 illustrates the extent to which processes of medicalization have reached, as it considerably multiplied the number of mental disorders a psychiatrist can treat.  among them we find, for instance, male hypoactive sexual desire disorder (tellingly, there is no female counterpart to this).  The financial interests of pharmaceutical industries also deserve part of the credit for the intensification of this process (Conrad 2007).  In this context, it is difficult to determine which comes first.  the disorder or the drugs.  Conrad seems to believe that in many cases the creation of a disease follows the production of a drug.  For instance, Conrad explains that, in the 1970s, the pharmaceutical company Upjohn discovered minoxidil was able to lower heart rate.  During clinical trials for hypertension, however, researchers accidentally noticed male patients grew new hair on their heads.  thus new target consumers for minoxidil were created and baldness became a medical problem.  With regards to transsexuality, its close relation to the developments in endocrinology in the 20th century, the growing hormone market and the technological advances in plastic and genital reconstructive surgery make gender transitions possible and highly profitable in some countries.  The second process that contributes to the global mobility of the DSM, and, as a consequence, to the widespread circulation of the APA’s worldviews and epistemic investments, has to do with epistemological colonization.  Central as it is to the globalization of certain texts and their effects on institutional and epistemological practices, the importance of epistemological colonization to the pathologization of transsexuality is also the link between the discussion in this paper and the main topic of this Special Issue, i. e.  to reflect upon the global South and its contributions to the study of discourse, gender and sexuality.  In this sense, medicalization is, to a great extent, a by-product of epistemological colonization.  By epistemological colonization I refer to the dynamics ‘in which the North produces theory and the South must supposedly import it and apply it’ (Miskolci and Pelucio 2017.  72).  Or, in the case of medicine, it refers to the fact that ‘medical epistemologies and technologies have long been seen as produced in Euro-America for export to less-industrialized countries as bases for regulating bodies and diseases’ (Briggs 2005.  279).  Having in mind this unequal geopolitics of knowledge, Miskolci (2014.  13) explains that even in an increasingly decentred world we still witness the hegemony of academic [and scientific] exchange in which the North produces theories and the South is seen as a space for collecting data, making ethnographic incursions or applying (Northern) theories to particular cases.  This dynamics constitutes what Borba et al.  (2014) call North-normativity.  a politics of knowledge production and circulation that is centred in and dominated by the Northern hemisphere.  Such epistemological imbalance, in which theories produced in the global North become highly mobile, is the result of what Connell (2007) and Grosfoghel (2011) describe as the universalizing tendencies of ‘Western’ theories.  due to their political, scientific and linguistic power such theories are taken to be valid throughout the globe when, in fact, they involve a theoretical leap based on European or North American contexts.  This process ends up producing the North as the norm and the South as the exotic Other (Borba et al.  2014) only liable of being the object of study, never its subject.  In his discussion of the geopolitics of knowledge production and circulation, Sousa Santos (1995) argues that the focus of epistemological criticism should fall on knowledge practices and their concrete effects on other social practices.  With this in mind, he contends that we should value ‘Southern epistemologies’, which, according to him, are guided by three main tenets.  ‘learning that the South exists, learning to go to the South, and learning from the South and with the South’ (Sousa Santos 1995.  508).  Following in Sousa Santos’ steps, more recently there has been an attempt to challenge such dynamics of epistemological colonization in the work of Connell (2007), who argues for a ‘Southern theory’, and Comaroff and Comaroff (2012a, 2012b, 2012c), who advocate for a ‘Theory from the South’.  For these authors, ‘the South’ is a metaphor that refers not only to a neat geographical region.  Perhaps most importantly, the South involves multiple configurations of discursive, material, and historical positionalities marked by a heritage of colonization, social immobility, subalternity, cultural and economic exploitation, Othering and, as in the case of transsexuality in Brazil and elsewhere, imposition of ex-centric textual standards that limit the scope of social action in institutional life and beyond.  In this sense, there is not only the geographical South as we know it, but also the South within the North.  for instance, Latin American sex workers in Europe (Piscitelli 2012), African asylum seekers in Belgium (Maryns 2006), and all those who, despite living in the global North, have very limited citizenship and chances for social mobility.  There is also, of course, the North within the South.  multinational corporations in India, petrol millionaires in Nigeria, etc.  Or, as Comaroff and Comaroff explain, ‘there is much south in the north, much north in the south, and [.  .  . ] more of both to come’ (2012b.  20).  In other words, ‘the South cannot be defined a priori in substantive terms.  The label refers to a relation, not a thing in or for itself’ (Comaroff and Comaroff 2012b.  20, original emphasis).  As the Comaroffs contend, given the current dynamics of capitalism, globalization and modernity, the South is often the first to feel the effects of world-historical processes and, thus, it provides us ‘the angle of vision [.  .  . ] from which to estrange our world in its totality in order better to make sense of its present and future’ (Comaroff and Comaroff 2012c, n. d. , original emphasis).  It is in this sense that Moita Lopes (2006) urges sociolinguists to ‘hear the voices from the South’.  According to this author, if sociolinguistics and other language-related fields of inquiry aim to be socially responsive and capable of intervening in the world, they should produce politically engaged knowledge with (not about) those who have been excluded from the benefits of modernity and have had their voices muted by the workings of the epistemological imbalances and discursive colonization discussed earlier.  In this vein, this politically engaged knowledge would be the result of the analytical attention to voice in the most Hymesian sense.  that is, a reconstruction of silenced voices (Hymes 1996) in a blatant political attempt to challenge the discursive dynamics that entrap their possibilities for agency.  A sociolinguistics from the South, to paraphrase the Comaroffs (2012c), is neither for the south nor necessarily from the south.  It is about the effects of the global circulation of certain discursive frameworks and institutional practices on the South and, mutatis mutandis, the effects of the South on discourse, language, institutions and on the production of knowledge within the field. 3 Such a sociolinguistics would pay due attention to both the macrosociological and macro-political mechanisms that allow certain discourses to travel globally and to their local microdiscursive effects.  Discursive colonization would be its bread and butter.  The case under scrutiny here is, to a great extent, a result of the incorporation of the APA’s pathologizing epistemology onto the SUS which provides free healthcare to the Brazilian population.  It should not be implied, though, that trans-specific healthcare in the global North is without its specific problems.  The main difference between public gender reassignment clinics in Brazil (such as the PAIST) and in the U. S.  lies in that fact that, in countries where trans-specific healthcare is only provided by private clinics, transsexual people have a little more room for negotiation.  This is so due to a process viviane v.  (2015), a Brazilian transfeminist activist, calls the ‘privatization of autonomy’.  In other words, due to the fact that in the U. S.  and elsewhere, trans people can only undergo hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgeries via private clinics, they seem to have more leeway to negotiate the quality of their healthcare.  Class is an important vector for agency here.  precisely because of who can afford operations and hormones, in the U. S.  ‘trans’ is sometimes seen as an upper-class identity. 4 However, little do we know about what happens inside gender clinics in the global North.  The few studies available (see, for example, Speer 2009, 2010) take the status of transsexuality as a mental disorder for granted and have little to say about the intersubjective effects such pathologization produces within those clinics.  This lack of critical analytical attention to the dynamics of pathologization in these studies may derive from the fact that discursive colonization of trans identities is less salient in the clinics analysed by Speer.  The critique of these diagnostic criteria (and the processes that allow their global circulation) is in tune with the international campaign Stop Trans Pathologization (STP2012) which aims at releasing transsexual people’s healthcare needs from psychiatric surveillance and towards more nuanced understandings of gender outside medical discourses (Misse and Col-Planas 2010.  Bento and Pelucio 2012).  In this scenario, the Brazilian Transsexualizing Process emerges at the intersection of global discursive flows that pathologize transsexuality and transsexual people’s local understandings of their bodies and subjective experiences.  IMPORTED TEXTUALITIES IN THE BRAZILIAN ‘TRANSSEXUALIZING PROCESS’.  As Bento (2006) explains, the individuals who the APA considers to be suffering from a gender disorder were at the epicentre of epistemological conflicts between the 1950s and 1970s in the U. S. A. .  different fields of medicine tried to explain the characteristics and the origin of transsexuality within their own scientific lenses.  Bento, in fact, argues that these epistemological conflicts have produced diverging explanations of this ‘disorder’.  biological and psychoanalytical fields of definition were established.  Despite being contradictory amongst themselves, but due to their apparent scientific objectivity, these theories made the inclusion of transsexuality in the APA manual possible.  The history of the APA’s interest in gender transition is a complex one which I am prevented from exploring in detail due to space constraints.  It is important to note, however, the centrality two diverging medical explanations have in the current institutional standards of textuality which regulate transsexual people’s and physicians’ lives in gender clinics around the globe.  These theories are those of the endocrinologist, Harry Benjamin, and those of the psychoanalyst, Robert Stoller.  Despite their differences, both shape what the APA (and as a consequence, the Brazilian government) understands as who counts as a ‘true transsexual’ (Benjamin 1999 [1966]).  Throughout this paper, I use the term ‘true transsexual’ between quotation marks to point to its origins in systems of knowledge/power which produce transsexuality as a mental disorder.  In this sense, the use of the concept in this format aims to highlight its diagnostic character, which is based on idealizations of what constitutes an allegedly authentic transsexuality (see also Borba 2015, 2016a, 2016b).  In his book, The Transsexual Phenomenon (1999 [1966]), Benjamin argues that transsexuality is a matter of biological determination.  Benjamin explains that the human sex is comprised of eight different ‘sexes’.  genetic, gonadal, germinal, endocrinological, phenotypical, psychological, legal and social.  Due to unnamed biological processes, transsexuality is the result of a radical dissociation of the psychological sex from the other ones.  Such dissociation produces a gender identity that is not in accordance with the more biologically based sexes of the body.  Benjamin explains, however, that this separation of the psychological sex may have different degrees and as such there are six types of transsexuality.  Only the most intense (types V and VI) should be classified ‘true transsexuals’ and thus should be considered for sex reassignment surgeries.  In Benjamin’s (1999 [1966].  11) view, the ‘true transsexual’.  feel[s] that they belong to the other sex, they want to be and function as members of the opposite sex, not only to appear as such.  For them, their sex organs, the primary (testes) as well as the secondary (penis and others) are disgusting deformities that must be changed by the surgeon’s knife.  (emphasis in original) Viewing transsexuality in these terms, Benjamin always defended the necessity of sex reassignment surgeries.  Since psychological sex is more ingrained, one should modify the morphology of the body, which, due to technological advances, may be transformed.  This would make more coherent individuals, as linearity among the different sexes would be restored, and, thus, the cultural intelligibility matrix (Butler 2003 [1990]) would be kept intact.  Benjamin’s views, however, did not go unchallenged.  One of the most important figures against sex reassignment surgeries was the psychoanalyst Robert Stoller, to whom transsexuality was the product of dysfunctional socialization within gender roles in the family.  Stoller focussed his efforts on analysing the socialization processes that would supposedly lead to gender non-conforming behaviours in adulthood.  To this end, the psychoanalyst worked with young boys whose parents were concerned about their ‘effeminacy’.  In his book, The Transsexual Experience (Stoller 1982 [1975]), he proposes that the origin of gender non-conforming behaviour in children (which could lead to the desire to undergo sex reassignment in the future) is the product of traumatic psychosocial dynamics imposed by the children’s relationship with their parents, more specifically the mother.  Following Freud’s concept of castration anxiety, Stoller suggests that the mother of a prospective transsexual person is a masculine woman whose penis envy is so strong that she transfers her unfulfilled desires onto her son.  This produces family dynamics in which the mother is powerful and dominating and the father is absent and emotionally unavailable.  In this context, the father cannot establish himself as a model and the Oedipus complex is interrupted, among other things, by the excess of physical contact between mother and child.  Stoller believed that it was possible to inculcate gender-conformity in these children via what he termed the ‘therapeutically motivated Oedipus complex’ (Stoller 1982 [1975].  101) in which the (male) therapist must serve as a ‘representative of society, health and of conformity with the external reality’ (1982 [1975].  80) providing the child with an ‘appropriate’ model of masculinity.  In his clinical practice, Stoller attempted to lead the child to disidentify with his envious mother, which was supposed to turn the child’s attention to stereotypically masculine activities, games and clothing preferences.  What is significant for the purposes of this paper is the centrality Stoller gave to childhood activities and to socialization.  The DSM-IVR definition of GID is a Benjamin-Stoller hybrid.  This diagnostic manual establishes the set of ‘symptoms’ individuals desiring to undergo sex reassignment surgeries must demonstrate in order to be diagnosed as ‘true transsexuals’ in the APA’s terms.  As such, the text imposes certain narrative demands (Coupland, Garret and Williams 2005) which must be fulfilled if one is to be granted institutional authorization to have one’s healthcare covered.  According to the DSM, there are four main symptoms a psychiatrist must pay attention to in order to diagnose someone as a ‘true transsexual’ (Figure 1).  I will not delve into a detailed discussion of the diagnostic criteria at this point but I will clarify them later on whenever relevant for understanding the interactions under investigation in this paper.  It is important to note, however, that in this manual, stereotypical gender behaviours make the reentextualization of Benjamin’s and Stoller’s theories in the DSM text possible.  The symptoms of GID do not merely materialize the medicalization of transsexuality.  in a broader sense, such entextualizations medicalize gender and, more significantly, the non-linearity between sex and gender.  As such, the DSM text is a vector of social control that attempts to maintain the current matrix of gender intelligibility (Bento 2006).  As I argue elsewhere (Borba 2015, 2016a, 2016b), by pathologizing gender transition through the supposed neutrality and objectivity of scientific language (Martınez-Guzman andI ~nıguez-Rueda 2010), this text homogenizes transsexual experiences and, thus, effaces the idiosyncrasies of alternative context-specific forms of transsexuality by producing it as a medical fact.  For a transsexual person to have free access to gender clinic services (hormone therapy and reassignment surgeries may all be covered by the state), they must abide by the rules of the most recent legislation of the FBM, i. e.  Resolution 1. 955/2010 which replicates the pathologization of transsexuality promulgated by the DSM.  The Resolution affirms that sex reassignment surgeries are the appropriate procedure for ‘treating’ the disorder.  In other words, by re-establishing an alleged coherence between the gender of identification and the sexual morphology, the disorder disappears and a sense of linearity is reinstated.  In order for surgeries to be allowed, transsexual clients must undergo at least two years of psychiatric and psychological assessment during which the medical team as a whole must produce a ‘medical diagnosis of transsexualism’ (Brasil 2010).  Such a diagnostic demand in Brazil, a country where configurations of gender and sexuality do not reflect those of the Anglo-Saxon world and gender transitions occur in very local shades (in this sense, see Kulick 1998.  Benedetti 2005.  Pelucio 2009), constitutes one of the local clogs in the epistemological machinery that makes the APA’s medicalization of non-medical problems circulate globally.  This kind of discursive colonization has at least two consequences for transsexual people and their doctors.  On a macro level, the fact that transsexuality is considered a mental disorder is what makes it possible for them to have their healthcare needs subsidized by the state or health insurance companies.  On a micro level, it produces interactional tensions which hinder a trusting healthcare relationship between doctors and their ‘patients’.  Such interactional obstacles emerge from the fact that transsexual individuals must satisfy the medical criteria listed by the DSM, which, as anthropological research has proved, has little resonance with their lived bodily and subjective experiences (Bento 2006.  Misse and Col-Planas 2010.  Lima 2011.  Bento and Pelucio 2012.  Teixeira 2013.  Borba 2016a).  In this scenario, how can transsexual people convince their doctors that they are in fact ‘true transsexuals’ in the APA’s sense.  This is mostly done in narratives in which transsexual clients of gender clinics must echo the diagnostic criteria almost literally in order to be regarded as ‘true transsexuals’.  My fieldwork has demonstrated that PAIST clients, upon being accepted to the clinic, are thrown into a socialization trajectory (Wortham 2006) during which they are led to narrate their experiences according to the medical staff’s expectations, having their opportunities for voice and agency limited.  In the Brazilian Transsexualizing Process, transsexual people are but the animators of a narrative whose author (i. e.  the APA) lies far away but is, nonetheless, ever present in consultations.  The analysis below focuses on the backstage performances of a new client at PAIST in which she is helped by more experienced clients to strategically reshape her life history in order to fit the APA’s diagnostic criteria.  This will be compared to what happens onstage (i. e.  in a consultation).  I argue that the pathologization of transsexuality locks the possibilities for agency outside the consultation room where transsexual clients help one another rehearse the necessary diagnostic narrative.  This rehearsed narrative, however, does not go unchallenged by the doctors.  Giovani, the PAIST surgeon, constantly told me that ‘there seems to be a book they all read’ and repeat in their consultations.  In what follows, I discuss the interpersonal obstacles the globalization of this medical epistemology imposes on doctors and their transsexual interlocutors.  LEARNING HOW TO BE A ‘TRUE TRANSSEXUAL’.  The imposition of a psychiatric diagnosis makes the re-entextualization (Silverstein and Urban 1996) of the DSM diagnostic criteria imperative for transsexual clients of gender clinics if they wish to have their healthcare needs covered by the state.  Re-entextualization is the discursive process whereby semiotic resources are extracted from a context and materialized in our social actions in another place and time.  To illustrate the centrality of this discursive dynamic in the Brazilian Transsexualizing Process, I draw on an ethnographic episode I participated in, which involved Vitoria (a new clinic user) and Rebeca and Gilda (more experienced clients).  On her first day at PAIST, Vitoria met Rebeca, Gilda and me while we were having breakfast at one of the food stands across from the hospital.  She was about 50 years old and, different from most clients of the clinic, donned very few indexical markers of femininity on her body.  Aside from her long, dark hair, nothing else was stereotypically feminine, which created a marked contrast between her and Rebeca and Gilda.  Vitoria had been married to a woman and had two adult daughters.  Her historical body (Scollon and Scollon 2004), i. e.  the embodiment of her life trajectories and individual experiences, contrasted with the DSM criteria for GID, which performatively entextualizes ‘true transsexuals’ as engaging in stereotypically feminine behaviours since early childhood and as asexual due to their disgust for their genitals.  Vitoria’s historical body indeed caused Rebeca and Gilda to distrust her performance as a transsexual person.  Rebeca challenged Vitoria.  ‘do you know the treatment here is for transsexuals. ’ Surprised, Vitoria replied she was aware of this.  ‘that’s why I’m here.  I’m trans. ’ Faced with Vitoria’s distinctive performance as a transsexual person, Gilda and Rebeca – the latter, as usual, carried copies of the Brazilian documents on the Transsexualizing Process in her purse – started advising Vitoria on how to behave and on what to say to her doctor in her consultation.  After Rebeca showed Vitoria the FBM’s resolutions, Gilda warned her that if she entered the physicians’ room dressed the way she was (i. e.  wearing ‘men’s’ clothes) they would not believe she was a transsexual woman.  ‘you look too masculine!’ Worried, Vitoria asked us whether she would be banned from the clinic due to the fact that she ‘was not as pretty’ as her interlocutors, to which Gilda replied.  ‘it’s just a matter of time.  As soon as you start taking hormones you’ll become a very pretty woman’.  Rebeca asked whether Vitoria was familiar with the DSM and advised her to read the diagnostic criteria attentively in order not to be caught in the doctor’s circular questions and attempts to spot incoherencies in her narrative.  In her interaction with Vitoria, Rebeca recontextualized the questions doctors ask the clients of the clinic.  According to her, they would ask Vitoria very intrusive questions about when she started ‘feeling different’, and explained ‘I tell them I started feeling different since I was born. ’ Vitoria, however, told us her feelings of inadequacy as a man started years after she got married.  Gilda advised her.  ‘don’t say that to them’.  Rebeca also told Vitoria the physicians would ask very invasive questions about her sexual life.  ‘I love sex’, whispered Vitoria while she checked to see if the clerk at the food stand was able to hear her.  Rebeca grinned at Gilda and fired off the suggestion.  ‘I think you shouldn’t admit that to them. ’ Rebeca continued.  ‘since you don’t take hormones yet, you must get hard-ons. ’ Vitoria acquiesced.  ‘I have erections now and then, but now that I’m getting older it doesn’t happen that frequently.  I don’t really care about it. ’ One more piece of advice followed.  ‘I think you shouldn’t admit that to them’, affirmed Rebeca.  What we see in this part of my field notes is the beginning of Vitoria’s introduction to the Transsexualizing Process through Rebeca and Gilda’s reentextualization of the interactions they had previously had with the PAIST medical staff, which in turn intertextually link them to the diagnostic criteria in the DSM.  Their advice to Vitoria illustrates the fact that ‘social identities may be durable projections from texts read in terms of entextualization processes’ (Silverstein and Urban 1996.  6).  On the day of our first meeting, Vitoria could not see her doctor due to a delay in the consultations and her need to catch a bus to the countryside where she lived.  She was able to reschedule her consultation, and two weeks later she met Carlos, one of the visiting physicians at PAIST.  Below are excerpts from her first consultation at the PAIST, which are presented in Brazilian Portuguese followed by a translation into English.  Transcription conventions are adapted from Jefferson (2004) (see Borba 2015 for details).  Excerpt 1 80 Carlos.

[. . -] The mismatch between the bits of Vitoria’s life history she shared with us in front of the hospital (i. e.  offstage) and the narrative (and the identity) that is performed to/with Carlos in the PAIST consultation room (i. e.  onstage) is apparent.  These scenes illustrate phases in the circulation of the discourse that medicalizes (and, thus, homogenizes) transsexuality and, ultimately, constrains both physicians’ and clinic users’ actions vis-a-vis each other.  Vitoria’s onstage attempts at performing true transsexuality within the DSM modes in the interaction with Carlos are operationalized through the transformation of the talk she had with Rebeca and Gilda (and possibly, many other texts) into a type of rehearsed narrative in which she adapts events in her life history to fit what she believes the doctor needs to hear in order to diagnose her.  In other words, according to Goffman (1959), when there is an identity test (especially one that is based on ex-centric terms), there is likely to be a spectacular performance of such an identity.  In the case of transsexuality, this sort of exaggerated performance emerges, to a great extent, from the repeated re-entextualizations of diagnostic criteria with which clinic users become increasingly familiar as they move through the Transsexualizing Process both outside and inside the consultation room (Borba 2016a, 2016b).  Right after taking a general medical history in which he discovers Vitoria has Type 1 diabetes (not shown above), Carlos turns his clinical gaze (Foucault 2001) to signs of ‘true transsexuality’ (lines 80–84).  Diabetes is not clinically relevant for the GID diagnosis, but it is important for Vitoria’s general health.  Carlos, however, is more interested in the GID than he is in something that is in fact health-related and that deserves clinical attention.  The importation of the DSM textual standards blinds physicians from real health problems and forces them to look only at the supposed gender disorder.  The demand for a GID diagnosis thus eclipses the fact that Vitoria has diabetes, a clinically relevant fact, which is almost completely ignored by the physician.  Although Vitoria began to identify as a transsexual woman in adulthood, Gilda’s advice to her (‘don’t say that to them’) metamorphoses into a narrative in which childhood activities are explained as symptoms that aim at fulfilling the doctor’s diagnostic question (‘how did you come to- to- to. .  the <conclusion> that you. . . .  suffer from a gender [>identity disorder<. ]’).  This question echoes one of the DSM criteria, which considers that there must be ‘intense desire to participate in the stereotypical games and pastimes of the other sex’ (American Psychiatric Association 1994.  537).  Evidence for the intensity of the ‘disorder’ is frequently searched for in childhood memories.  Note that Vitoria anticipates the physician’s question and replies before he even finishes his turn (lines 84–85).  She continues her narrative by saying that from the age of 12 her dressing in feminine clothes became more frequent.  Carlos, however, understands she started wearing her mother’s and cousins’ clothes at that age, to which Vitoria emphatically replies (line 113) by affirming she was seven years old when she started dressing up.  After all, the earlier an individual identifies as a transsexual, the truer a transsexual that person is, according to the DSM.  The diagnostic question sequence carries on as follows.

Both in the meeting we had in front of the hospital and in her interaction with Carlos, Vitoria is exposed to the centrality of this diagnostic criterion.  In fact, during her talk with us, Vitoria implied she was not bothered by her penis or her rare erections.  Besides this, she has two daughters, which puts her historical body in contradiction with what the Brazilian government, replicating the DSM, regards as ‘true transsexuals’.  She is thus in a dilemma.  having had kids with her former wife would be an indication she does not feel the discomfort the DSM propounds to be typical of transsexual people eligible for undergoing sex reassignment.  Faced with the fact that she has two daughters, Carlos carried on his diagnostic task and in lines 226–230 inquires whether Vitoria takes a penetrative role in her sexual relations with her current boyfriend.  If the answer had been positive, not only would she have been disqualified as a ‘true transsexual’, but she would also be categorized as a travesti.  Space constraints do not allow me to discuss the complex systems of gender and sexuality in Brazil, but, to put it simply, travestis are transgender individuals who modify their bodies to acquire feminine shapes but who generally do not wish to undergo sex reassignment surgeries.  According to anthropological research, they identify as gay men who, due to the specific configurations of gender and sexuality in Latin America, shape their bodies with feminine clothes and (industrial) silicone to be more sexually attractive to ‘heterosexual’ men (see Kulick 1998.  Borba and Ostermann 2007.  Pelucio 2009).  The interaction between Carlos and Vitoria underpins how these local understandings of gender and sexuality relate to the universalizing and simplifying effects of the imported ex-centric diagnostic discourse.  Although travestis and transsexual people do not typically share the same subjectivity and/or bodily practices, they do share semantic fields of identification and social positions of marginality in the Brazilian culture.  The lines between these two identities are difficult to draw since many transsexual people do not wish to undergo surgeries for a multitude of reasons.  This, however, is not taken into consideration at the Brazilian Transsexualizing Process since the desire to have one’s body surgically modified is a central diagnostic criterion guiding physicians’ gaze.  As Vitoria’s case highlights, the imposition of the DSM diagnostic manual into the Brazilian health system impels doctors to engage in a crusade in search of ‘true transsexuals’ which ends up disregarding travestis as individuals who also need specialized healthcare (Borba 2015, 2016b). 5 At line 231, Vitoria replies to Carlos’ questions negatively by reinforcing her answer with a repetition so that no doubt about her use of her penis would remain.  Despite her emphatic negative answer, the physician asks for a confirmation of this information at line 232.  In turn, Vitoria once again says she does not use her penis (line 233).  After having received three negative answers to the same question, Carlos seems satisfied and closes the sequence at line 234.  If there were any doubts as to her identifying as a travesti and her using her penis for sexual pleasure, this should have been erased by this questioning sequence.  However, despite having confirmed that she does not use her penis and should not be considered a travesti, Carlos keeps inquiring about how Vitoria relates to her penis (lines 245–259).  In this consultation, Vitoria is at the intersection of such discursive conflict.  Although she had told us her penis did not disgust her (at least not with the intensity required by the DSM), in her interaction with the physician, she answers positively to his question at lines 245–247.  Despite the discomfort she reports in the consultation room, Vitoria has not yet decided whether she wants to undergo sex reassignment.  Her uncertainty with regards to the surgeries also raises suspicion that she is not a ‘true transsexual’, since the desire to be operated upon is a prerequisite of the DSM classification, regardless of the many reasons transsexual people may have for not wanting to have their bodies surgically modified (i. e.  fear, insecurity, age, etc. ).  Carlos and Vitoria’s diagnostic interactional exchange materializes locally the globalized narrative demands that the legal requirement of a GID diagnosis imposes on the Brazilian Transsexualizing Process.  These demands revolve around three narrative axes.  1.  childhood cross-dressing.  2.  gender inadequacy.  and 3.  discomfort felt regarding one’s genitals.  In this sense, the DSM textually imposes the adequate life history of ‘true transsexuals’ and performatively produces a mental disorder through this entextualization.  Within this textually constrained interactional scenario, Vitoria seems to have successfully managed her performance as a ‘true transsexual’ by refashioning some events in her life to suit the diagnostic criteria with which she by now has become familiar.  Nonetheless, her historical body leads Carlos to glimpse at the rehearsed quality of her narrative.  Right after this diagnostic sequence, the physician left Vitoria in his room and consulted with In^es, the PAIST psychologist.  Carlos told In^es of how squarely Vitoria’s narrative fit within the diagnostic criteria.  ‘what he tells me would lead me to believe he is a real transsexual, but for me, he looks more like a rock musician than a trans.  Even his voice is masculine!’ (note the use of the masculine to refer to Vitoria, which contrasts with how PAIST’s professionals usually refer to clients they consider adequate trans-women).  In^es, who had welcomed Vitoria upon her arrival at the clinic, agreed with Carlos’ assessment without even having heard her life narrative and corroborated his diagnosis.  ‘it seems he has done his homework and knows what to tell us.  For me, he is a travesti’ (field notes, 5 May 2010).  In other words, this consultation materializes one of the discursive clashes the importation of a global text brings to this local context.  a ‘true transsexual’, on the one hand, is the textual solidification of knowledge systems produced in the global North within an epistemological war to define the origin and the clinical management of transsexual people.  a travesti, on the other hand, embodies Latin American discourses on gender and sexuality.  In^es’ assessment of Vitoria’s performance indirectly leads us back to the centrality of the DSM’s performative production of ‘true transsexuals’.  Vitoria’s homework, in this sense, may easily refer to the fact that she has studied what to tell the doctors.  Indeed, when Carlos returned to his room and was about to close the consultation, Vitoria told him she has been keeping herself informed, as can been seen in the extract below.  Excerpt 3 646 Carlos.  <<infelizmente>> infelizmente- >mas assim< e 647 um programa longo [n~ao] precisa pressa agora 648 Vitoria.

This adds another vector for the circulation of the DSM epistemology within PAIST.  learning how to be a ‘true transsexual’ is not only linked to the DSM text per se but also to the interactions among users of the clinic and their reading about transsexuality on the Internet and other places.  Narratives of ‘true transsexuality’ within this gender clinic are, thus, a work of local (inter)textual bricolage based on globally available discursive frameworks.  The imposition of these diagnostically-driven narratives also makes physicians increasingly suspicious of their transsexual interlocutors.  According to Giovani, PAIST’s surgeon, clients of the clinic engage in what he calls a ‘standardized discourse’.  In an interview with me, he says he is worried about the ‘lies’ transsexual people tell the physicians, which prevents the staff from knowing the clients’ medical history with any level of certainty.  Giovani believes clinic users’ narratives are ‘quite stereotypical’ and he goes on to answer my question about why transsexual people ‘lie’ to the medical staff.  The consultations must be based on the Resolution.  So if she doesn’t say the things that are in the Resolution it’s as if- the healthcare professionals aren’t seen as someone who wants to help, someone who makes her life easier.  They are seen as an obstacle for the transsexual to get what she wants from the system.  So she comes and learns [the narrative] and even those who don’t know the discourse, since consultations are frequent, the questions are repetitive, they learn what has to be answered.  So it’s something like this ‘when you’re having sex, do you allow your boyfriend to touch your penis. ’ She replies, ‘oh, God forbid, never ever’, because they know that genital aversion is important to receive the authorization for surgery.  (interview with Giovani, 24 June 2010, lines 232–253) PAIST’s psychologist has similar concerns, as she told me in an interview when asked about this ‘standardized discourse’.  ‘they read the book and so they lie right.  because they have an ideal of women they must convey in order to convince us [.  .  . ] so they try to sell us preconceived ideas’ (interview with In^es, 6 June 2010, lines 254–267).  The medical staff is not only concerned about the fact that transsexual people ‘lie’, they also know the source of the ‘lies’ and are able to perceive them in consultations.  Transsexual users of the clinic, in turn, trapped in a discursive hurricane of whirling conflicting entextualizations of transsexuality, are aware of the necessity of producing a narrative persona that may fulfil the text-based diagnostically-driven narrative demands imported by the SUS.  Or, as Livia told me in an interview when asked whether she thought transsexuality was a mental disorder.  ‘since it is a disease for them, whenever I have a consultation I arrive there crestfallen, crying and pretending I’m autistic (laughs)’.  What I refer to as ‘rehearsed narratives’, the medical staff calls ‘lies’.  But, as we can grasp from Vitoria’s consultation with Carlos, the diagnostic interactional exchange is shaped by transsexual people’s ‘lies’ (i. e.  textually-based rehearsed narratives) and the medical staff’s own ‘lies’ (i. e.  textually-based rehearsed diagnostic sequences).  At this stage, it is paramount to mention the fact that the PAIST’s medical staff, as opposed to the DSM, do not actually consider transsexuality a mental disorder, as they repeatedly told me during fieldwork.  According to Giovani, the pathologization of transsexuality ‘is an absurd, right.  these inconsistencies that happen but as everything else as [society evolves], things get better.  So transsexuality cannot be considered a disease in the ICD, for instance’ (interview with Giovani, 24 June 2010).  In^es, the psychologist, affirmsmy experience [with transsexuality] is not very vast.  I learned about it here and the more you work with them, the more you see it’s not a disorder.  You don’t understand very well how it works, but it is not.  It’s so natural what they say and how they say it that you must accept it, right.  (interview with In^es, 14 June 2010) However, their medical actions are constrained by the Brazilian documents regulating the Transsexualizing Process and, as a consequence, by the globalization of apparently objective medical epistemologies onto a context whose views of gender and sexuality differ dramatically from those the APA’s manual help circulate globally.  Vitoria’s case illustrates the narrative constraints imposed by the globalization of this particular medical epistemology which impels the production of an idealized performance of transsexuality.  The importation of these medicalized textualities to the Brazilian Transsexualizing Process obliterates local bodily and subjective experiences of transsexuality and, thus, impedes the construction of a trusting healthcare relationship with the clinics’ medical staff.  In this context, these pathologizing textualities limit the autonomy and agency of both transsexual clients and their doctors, since their actions (discursive or otherwise) must please this ghost audience.  In other words, in the microdetails of their talk, they successfully manage the textual constraints imposed by the legislation in which transsexuality is constructed as a homogenous and objective medical fact.  The requirement of a diagnosis within the APA’s framework forces gender clinic clients and staff to engage in such textuallylimited identity performances in order to reentextualize transsexuality as a mental disorder for the purposes of the Transsexualizing Process.  The globalization of the APA’s medical epistemologies has at least two consequences for the Brazilian gender clinics.  because of such discursive colonization, trans-specific healthcare policies (1) become identity-based instead of being comprehensively health-focused and (2) are based on ex-centric standards of textuality which eclipse local understandings of gender and sexuality.  <Conclusion> FINAL REMARKS.  How does the global circulation of certain discourses about transsexuality and Vitoria’s exposure to such mobile texts point to possibilities and challenges for a sociolinguistics from the South.  How can such southern epistemology (Sousa Santos 1995) develop its critique of the relationships between discourse circulation, gender and sexuality.  Some answers may come from the practices of those who face such discursive colonization as the purveyor of ways of thinking, behaving, viewing the world and relating to others, namely transsexual people themselves.  In a self-ethnography of her experiences in the Brazilian public health system, transfeminist activist and scholar viviane v.  (2015) critically assesses the epistemological imbalances the importation of the ‘true transsexual’ model of identity imposes on the country’s trans-specific healthcare.  After facing innumerous difficulties to access comprehensive and humanized healthcare in her city, v.  concludes that such obstacles resulted from the fact that her body and subjectivity as a transsexual person have been colonized by ex-centric standards of textuality which end up producing epistemological hierarchies and obliterating subaltern cosmologies (Grosfoghel 2011).  Despite her self-determination as a trans woman, her voice is not taken into consideration as an agent in decisions about her own health.  Instead, the healthcare decisions are made by the DSM’s ‘true transsexual’ diagnostic model.  In this context, v.  (2015.  119) argues that the pathologization of certain non-conforming bodies and genders works as a colonial device of control and normalization, which restricts their autonomy and existential viability.  This is particularly true when their specific needs are not taken into account in public health settings which are less prone to the privatization of one’s autonomy.  (my translation) What drives v. ’s critique is the erasure of local, radically contextualized forms of transsexuality in the Brazilian health system in favor of an imported model of identity which has little resonance in people’s lives and subjectivities below the equator line.  This importation, as Vitoria’s case illustrates, is trans-oppressive.  In a recent article, Connell (2014.  212) asks.  ‘how can the global pattern of centrality versus dependence be contested. ’ Her answer is as straightforward as it is complex.  by asserting ‘alternative knowledge systems’ (Connell 2014.  212).
