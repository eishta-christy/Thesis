I N T R O D U C T I O N.  Human communication relies on the ability to track beliefs and other epistemic states, since hearers try to infer the speaker’s intentions during conversation (Grice, ).  The ability to consult epistemic states during communication has been argued to be present early in life.  infants take into account a speaker’s knowledge when ﬁxing reference for novel expressions (Baldwin, .  Bloom, .  Koenig & Echols, ), and exclude as potential referents for novel labels objects that they already have names for (Diesendruck & Markson, ).  Other studies show that children trust knowledgeable over uninformed speakers when acquiring novel labels.  when a speaker explicitly claimed ignorance about the correct referent of a novel word (e. g.  “I don’t know what a blicket is.  Maybe it’s this one. ”), three- and four-year-olds did not learn the word (Sabbagh & Baldwin, ).  In another study, four-year-olds, and in some cases three-year-olds, preferred to learn a novel label from a previously reliable speaker than from one who claimed ignorance of the names of familiar objects or who labeled them incorrectly (Koenig & Harris, .  cf.  also Birch, Vauthier & Bloom, .  Jaswal & Neely, ).  Nevertheless, whether (and how early) preschoolers track their interlocutors’ mental states is still a matter of debate.  For instance, some commentators have suggested that young children’s ability to match previously unlabeled referents to novel words does not require the use of pragmatic reasoning, since this ability is present in autistic populations who have deficits in social cognition (de Marchena, Eigsti, Worek, Ono & Snedeker, .  see also Breheny, ).  Other work has questioned whether older children and even adults successfully adopt the perspective of their interlocutors during referential communication (Epley, Morewedge & Keysar, .  but see Nadig & Sedivy, ).  Moreover, several studies have shown that five-year-olds have difficulties with pragmatic inferences that rely on calculations of how informative a speaker should be based on her knowledge and the conversational needs (Noveck, .  Papafragou & Musolino, .  Huang & Snedeker, .  among others).  A particularly stringent and straightforward test for preschoolers’ ability to consult others’ belief states during communication is to ask whether children can adjust their expectations about the speaker’s referential intent when learning a word from a speaker with a false belief.  False belief paradigms have been used extensively in the developmental literature to study sensitivity to others’ epistemic states in non-communicative contexts (i. e.
