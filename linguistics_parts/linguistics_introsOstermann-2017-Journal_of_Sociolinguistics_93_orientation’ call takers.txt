INTRODUCTION.  Issues of how to analyze gender and sexual identities in interaction have been largely already discussed, in particular in the field of Conversation Analysis (CA) (Schegloff 1997, 1998.  Wetherell 1998.  Kitzinger 2000.  Speer and Stokoe 2011).  Some of the criticism addressed by conversation analysts is that much of the research on the relationships between language, gender, and sexuality lies in understanding speakers and talk as predetermined by abstract discourses ‘from above’ or ‘beyond’ talk (Speer and Stokoe 2011.  7).  Schegloff (1997) claims that gender has to be demonstrably relevant to the participants – instead of being (a priori and exogenously) imposed by analysts – in order to be used as an analytical social category in social interaction.  The author notes, for instance, that it is not enough to justify referring to someone as a ‘woman’ just because she is, in fact, a woman – because she is, by the same token, a Californian, Jewish, a mediator, a former weaver, my wife, and many other things.  (Schegloff 1997. CA methodological criteria on what counts as analytical categories, and its reluctance to bring wider (or macro) social issues2 – such as power, heteronormativity, and oppression – aprioristically into the analysis, have not gone without criticism (e. g.  Wetherell 1998).  In response to the criticism of CA’s conceptualization of what actually is relevant to the participants or what constitutes participants’ orientation to gender (e. g.  Wetherell 1998.  Ehrlich 2002), a number of scholars have demonstrated how powerful the conversational analytical lenses might be at grasping gender and sexual identities in action (e. g.  Ehrlich 2002.  Kitzinger 2005, 2007.  Speer and Stokoe 2011.  Ostermann and Kitzinger 2012).  As Weatherall (2002.  768) points out, [b]eing limited, as an analyst, to the overtly displayed concerns of the participants is not to say that gender is not omni-relevant.  What it does mean is that it is incumbent on the researcher to show how and that gender as omnirelevant is produced and oriented to.  Moreover, once analysts have demonstrated and described the specific and practical ways of how gender is actualized in interaction, this might also allow them to show how such practices could possibly be changed (Ostermann and Kitzinger 2012).  Aligned with the perspective taken by other studies interested in unveiling how participants orient to gender and sexuality in talk and how larger social constructs come into being in social interaction, the current study also takes up Garfinkel’s ethnomethodological claim (1967) that it is part of the analysts’ task to actually show how interactants’ production of their everyday activities is informed by certain categorizations and how the interactants demonstrate their oriention to them (Stokoe 2000, 2006.  Stokoe and Smithson 2001.  Stokoe and Weatherall 2002.  Speer and Stokoe 2011).  In other words, the analysis and discussion presented in this paper assume an understanding that interactants are continuously attributing meaning to and demonstrating their understanding of interactions, the world around them and what is happening here and now.  Thus, a close analysis of naturally occurring interactions is taken here as central to explaining the methods and everyday practices that participants use in order to produce such worlds (Garfinkel 1967.  Speer and Stokoe 2011).  Such perspective also reflects how this paper connects with the special theme of this issue.  The perspective assumed here is not one of North and South, West and non-West, developed and developing (or even underdeveloped), First and Third World, center and periphery, or the macro and micro.  Instead, it assumes a tentatively less dichotomous perspective that proposes to simply shift our point of departure by first looking at the ‘margins’ (Milani 2014), and only then investigating how the margins – perhaps unavoidably – relate (or not) to what has been taken to be the ‘metropole’.  What I propose, in fact, is not new.  to (firstly) look at and (only later) theorize from language where language is actually used.  to look at and theorize from the actual sites where people are interacting in the world to carry out their everyday affairs, investigating how they orient (or not) to certain categories and how they make sense of the world while doing so. 3 In this sense, Conversation Analysis and categorization analysis serve as empowering analytical lenses to investigate participants’ own understandings and categorizations of gender and sexuality.  In order to frame the analysis of this paper within the larger theme of the Special Issue, I take here Comaroff and Comaroff’s invitation (2012a.  1), originally formulated as ‘What if we posit that, in the present moment, it is the global south that affords privileged insight into the workings of the world at large. ’ (emphasis added), and modify it slightly so as to propose that ‘What if we posit that [.  .  . ] it is the micro level of everyday interactions that affords privileged insight into the workings of the world at large’.  This work, thus, investigates the micro level of talk-in-interaction itself in the production and naturalization of understandings of gender and sexuality.  By analyzing language as it is used by people when conducting their everyday affairs, the study looks at how ‘heteronormativity’ (Warner 1991) or ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ (Rich 1980.  Butler 1990) are actualized in naturalistic data, and how intersubjectivity (understood here as the participants’ mutual understandings), in particular when at stake, might reveal ‘heteronormativity in action’, to borrow Kitzinger’s (2005) words.  By relying on such an analytical perspective, the paper also aims to call into question the traditional dichotomy of the micro and macro perspectives, demonstrating how the interactional moment, as a condensed historicity of participants’ own understandings and categorizations of gender and sexuality, seems to respond to a wider sociocultural repertoire which makes what is local simultaneously translocal.  <Middle> SITUATING THE SETTING, DATA, AND METHODS.  Helplines, the interactional context of interest here, are dedicated telephonebased services (delivered by both the private and public sector) that provide some type of assistance, guidance and/or simply information on a range of topics or concerns, such as legal, medical, emotional, among others (Baker, Emmison and Firth 2005).  An example of a helpline would be a phone number made available by a software company to help customers with troubleshooting.  Within the context of helplines, it is by means of talk-in-interaction that callers and call takers conduct their main business, i. e.  to request for and receive some type of help – whose nature, of course, can vary.  In addition, it is by means of talk-in-interaction that specific meanings are negotiated, and the participants’ reasoning, assumptions and beliefs are rendered visible.  The wider study from which this investigation derives comprises 308 audio recorded and fully transcribed, naturally occurring phone-call interactions directed to a Brazilian governmental health helpline, Centro de Informac~oes sobre Saude (also referred to here as CIS). 4 That is a toll free number, created by the Brazilian Ministry of Health to provide citizens with health information and referrals.  Most users of the helpline are working-class citizens with low educational background whose access to health information (including internet access) is limited.  The interactions analyzed for the larger investigation from which this study derives, and whose main purpose was to investigate morality in action in interactions in women’s public health services in Brazil, were limited to those initiated by a citizen, and then only those in which the caller selected ‘women’s health’ in the initial menu, and further selected one of the following topics in the submenu.  HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, cancer or contraception.  As is the case for most telephone services in Brazil nowadays, all CIS calls are automatically recorded by the management for quality control, with callers being informed of the recording at the start of every call by means of an automated message.  It is important to register, however, that all calls are anonymous.  At no instance in the interactions are callers asked to reveal their names.  Thus, in order to ensure the highest possible ethical care while simultaneously abiding by the institutional demand to not interfere with their current practices at the time, written permission for participation in the study was requested only from the call takers. 5 Those who chose not to take part in the study had their wish respected and, thus, the institutional recordings of their calls were not analyzed.  In addition, any mention of proper names that might indicate who the participants are, including names of cities, streets, and institutions, were replaced by fictitious ones.  The analysis presented here focusses on the final phase of the phone calls.  more specifically, the analysis is circumscribed to the phase when the institutional representative (call taker or CT) applies a survey that requests demographic information from the caller (C).  This survey was introduced in 2010 by the Ministry of Health as part of the service provided by the helpline, CIS.  The introduction of surveys at the end of the calls was motivated by the government’s initiative to gather statistics about the helpline callers in order to propose actions more closely tailored to their profiles, including the need to serve LGBTT users more adequately in the public health system.  Out of the corpus of 308 recorded phone calls analyzed in the larger study, only 31 contained the recording of the survey.  That survey comprised 20 questions, ordered in a pre-arranged way.  Among the information requested about the caller were age, gender, sexual orientation, and educational level.  Despite some initial neglect of the survey recordings in the phone calls, a closer look at the data revealed that speakers interactionally demonstrated problems when dealing with one specific question.  the one about the caller’s sexual orientation.  It is the interactional trajectory of the sequence surrounding such a question that this paper investigates.  Following the tradition of other conversation analytical studies (Kitzinger 2000.  Paoletti 2002.  Speer 2005.  Wilkinson and Kitzinger 2014.  Lindstr€om, N€aslund and Rubertsson 2015), in order to carry out such investigation, I combine Conversation Analysis (CA) (Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson 1974) with categorization analysis (Sacks 1992).  Moreover, at some points in the analysis I also rely on some ethnographic notes about the call center and its workings.  SEXUAL ORIENTATION AS INTERACTIONALLY DELICATE.  The sequence involving the actions of requesting and providing information about the caller’s sexual orientation reveals itself as interactionally ‘delicate’ (Silverman and Per€akyl€a 1990.  Per€akyl€a 1995) by the participants’ orientation to it.  The first evidence for such a claim is that such a question is deliberately moved by the CTs from its middle position in the survey list – i. e.  allocated by the Ministry of Health as the 10th out of 20 questions – to be asked as the very last, as Figure 1 below illustrates.  This change, as reported by the call takers in informal conversations with me, is a way to maximize the information obtained by means of the survey, since a number of callers hang up after being asked about their sexuality.  Thus, according to the call takers, by requesting that information as the last question in the survey, if the call is abruptly terminated, the responses to the rest of the survey could still have been obtained.  Secondly, as an attempt to deal with the complexity of the question about ‘sexual orientation’, call takers make use of alternative ways of designing the format of the request.  The original structure of the question posed by the Ministry of Health – an open Wh-question (What is your sexual orientation.
