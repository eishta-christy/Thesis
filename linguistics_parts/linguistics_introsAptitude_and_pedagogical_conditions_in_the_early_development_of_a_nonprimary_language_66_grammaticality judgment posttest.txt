The ﬁeld of second language acquisition has always tried to understand the construct of aptitude, which has often been used to refer to cognitive abilities implicated in language learning (e. g. , Robinson, 2005a).  This interest stems from the need to understand the underlying cognitive processes involved in language learning.  Traditionally, aptitude was seen as the abilities that were measured by the Modern Language Aptitude Test (MLAT) developed by Carroll and Sapon in 1959.  The test contained ﬁve sections.  number learning, phonetic script, spelling cues, words in sentences, and paired associates, which were suggested to measure the following.  rote learning ability and memory, phonetic coding ability, inductive language learning, and grammatical sensibility.  Despite its shortcomings and the presence of new tests such as the Cognitive Ability for Novelty in Acquisition of Language—Foreign and the LLAMA Language Aptitude Test (see Skehan, 2012), the MLAT is still being widely used as it is considered one of the most successful predictors of language learning, both in instructional contexts (Ehrman & Oxford, 1995.  Erlam, 2005.  Harley & Hart, 1997.  Winke, 2013) and in laboratory studies (DeGraaff, 1997.  Robinson, 1997).  Nevertheless, and in order to account for the multicomponential view of the construct, current research prefers to report results on speciﬁc subtests of the MLAT rather than a composite score.  Two subtests that have been found to be good predictors of language learning are the paired associates subtest (e. g. , Hummel, 2009.  Robinson, 1997), which measures rote memory (RM), and the words in sentences subtest (e. g. , Erlam, 2005.  Li, 2013), which measures grammatical sensitivity or linguistic analytic ability (LAA).  One of the subcomponents of aptitude that has received more attention is memory.  Early interpretations of memory (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968) considered short-term memory (STM) a storage mechanism through which information was transferred to long-term memory by means of rehearsal.  Baddeley and Hitch (1974) later argued that STM should be replaced with working memory (WM), a system concerned not only with storage but also with active processing.  Skehan (2002) and Robinson (2005a) suggested expanding the traditional view of aptitude by integrating WM measures into “a much broader battery of aptitude subtests than operationalized in MLAT and other traditional tests” (Robinson 2005a, p.  51).  One of the most acknowledged models of WM is the multiple-component model developed by Baddeley and Hitch (1974) and later modiﬁed by Baddeley (2000), which views WM as a system consisting of (a) a central executive, to control and regulate attention.  (b) a phonological loop, involved in retaining verbal information in a temporary store.  (c) a visuospatial sketch pad, which maintains visual or spatial information.  and (d) an episodic buffer, a temporary storage system that integrates the information processed in the other subsystems and long-term memory.  Baddeley suggests that the combination of the processing and storage components of WM can help predict individual differences in cognitive skills such as reading, comprehension, and reasoning.  In addition, this model considers the central executive an attentional system (Baddeley & Logie, 1999), and therefore it closely relates attention, and consequently language learning, to WM.  Research looking at the role of WM in second language (L2) acquisition has adopted different perspectives.  While one line of research looks at the role of the phonological loop on L2 acquisition with the implementation of phonological STM (PSTM) tests, another approach explores the role of both storage and processing capacity and implements sentence span tests (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980) as WM measures.  Both lines of investigation have found that there is a relationship between WM and L2 learning (see Williams, 2012, for a review).  An important issue that has obvious implications for L2 learning and teaching is whether the role of aptitude varies depending on the type of instruction received.  This issue has been investigated in different aptitude–treatment interaction (ATI) studies (see Vatz, Tare, Jackson, & Doughty, 2013).  The present study attempts to contribute to this line of research by investigating whether cognitive abilities such as LAA, RM, WM, and PSTM play a different role in language development depending on the learning conditions (i. e. , presence or absence of grammar explanation while providing corrective feedback).  With the inclusion of four different measures, this study hopes to account for the current multicomponential view of aptitude and to provide a broader picture of the cognitive skills that play a role in language learning.  The following section provides an overview of relevant studies that have investigated ATI and include at least one of the aptitude measures proposed in the present study.  Although Krashen (1981, 1982) claimed that aptitude inﬂuences language learning only in conditions that promote explicit learning (see Robinson, 2002, 2005a, for a discussion on this issue), other researchers such as Skehan (1998, 2002) argue that aptitude plays a larger role in more informal (e. g. , non-classroom immersion) contexts, as learners are under more pressure when processing input.  Laboratory settings, however, show that the picture is not clear and that results vary with the learning condition and the cognitive measure implemented (DeGraaff, 1997.  Robinson, 1997, 2002.  Sanz, Lin, Lado, Bowden, & Stafford, 2014.  Tagarelli, Borges Mota, & Sanz, 2014.  Tagarelli, Ruiz, Moreno, & Rebuschat, 2016) De Graaff (1997) investigated the learning of a language adapted from Esperanto (eXperanto) in a laboratory setting.  Fifty-four participants were asked to learn simple and complex morphological and syntactic forms in 150 hr of computer-based lessons, during which they had to read dialogue translations, complete vocabulary activities, and practice interpreting and producing the target forms.  There were two groups that varied in degrees of explicitness.  an explicit group, with explicit rules presented before practice and during the provision of feedback on the correctness of their answers in the activities.  and an implicit group, with the same corrective feedback (right/wrong) but without rule presentation before or during the activities.  Acquisition was measured by grammaticality judgment and production tests.  An adaptation of the MLAT in Dutch containing the “words in sentences” and “paired associates” tests was administered.  The results from the aptitude tests were collapsed so that correlations analyses could be run.  It was revealed that the explicit group performed better on all language tests and on simple and complex forms.  In addition, it was found that aptitude correlated with performance on language tests.  However, there was no interaction between aptitude and treatment condition.  aptitude was positively related to language performance not only in the explicit but also in the implicit condition.  Robinson (1997) also measured aptitude with the MLAT in a laboratory study that included different degrees of explicitness.  One hundred four English L2 students were distributed into four different treatments to learn an “easy rule” (subject–verb inversion is allowed in sentences where adverbials of movement/location are fronted) and a “hard rule” (how to form pseudoclefts of location).  The four conditions varied depending on whether participants were instructed to memorize the stimuli (implicit), to comprehend it (incidental), to look for rules (rule search), or were exposed to the rules in advance (instructed).  The training sessions exposed participants to 2 sets of 40 sentences (20 based on the easy rule and 20 on the hard rule).  Acquisition was measured by a grammaticality judgment posttest, and aptitude was measured using the “words in sentences” and “paired associated” subtests of the English MLAT.  The results revealed that the scores on the words in sentences test signiﬁcantly correlated with learning in the implicit, rule-search, and instructed conditions, but not in the incidental condition.
