I N T R O D U C T I O N.  Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) fail to develop expressive and/or receptive oral language at the same rate and/or to the same extent as typically developing children, despite adequate intelligence, peripheral sensory functioning, exposure to language, and no neurological, emotional, or social dysfunction (Bishop, .  Leonard, .  Rice, ).  Compared to same-age peers, these children demonstrate an uneven profile of abilities across domains of language, with most experiencing difficulties in grammatical morphology and syntax, but many also demonstrating difficulties in lexical and pragmatic skills (Leonard, ).  Difficulty in lexical processes underlying spoken word recognition is well documented in SLI.  inefficiency or inaccuracy in establishing, accessing, selecting, and retrieving from stored representations of spoken language (Dollaghan, ).  For example, children with SLI tend to have smaller overall expressive/receptive vocabulary (Hick, Botting & Conti-Ramsden, ) and impaired phonological processing (Briscoe, Bishop & Norbury, ), use fewer different words per utterance (Rice, Redmond & Hoffman, .  Wong, Klee, Stokes, Fletcher & Leonard, b), and are less accurate in nonword repetition (Estes, Evans & Else-Quest, ).  Multiple accounts have been proposed to explain the different language deficits observed in children with SLI, and much research has focused on the grammatical deficit account and the processing deficit account (Joanisse & Seidenberg, .  Leonard, ).  Some researchers have also explored the possibility of deficits in specific mechanisms such as lower-level auditory perception (Corriveau, Pasquini & Goswami, .  McArthur & Bishop, a, b.  Tallal & Piercy, ), but little research to date has focused on auditory perception and word recognition deficits within the same children with SLI (but see Montgomery, ).  The present study responded to this research gap by focusing on lexical access for spoken word recognition in SLI, and whether and how it might be related to auditory perception.  Spoken word recognition and the speech-gating task.  Spoken word recognition occurs when auditory perceptual input activates a single lexical phonological representation.
