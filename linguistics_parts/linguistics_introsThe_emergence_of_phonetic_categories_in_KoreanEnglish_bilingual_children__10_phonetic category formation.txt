Intro.  Bilingual children are commonly categorized as either simultaneous or sequential (Goldstein, ), although the age criteria deﬁning each group vary among researchers.  Without controversy, children who learn two languages from birth are designated as simultaneous bilinguals (Padilla & Lindholm, ), but so have been those who learn two languages within the ﬁrst year after birth (Genesee, Paradis & Crago, ), or even up to age three (McLaughlin, ).  Following McLaughlin, we identify children exposed to both languages before three years of age as ‘simultaneous bilinguals’, or, simply, bilingual children.  Phonetic category formation in the sense of this paper refers to the processes by which bilingual or second language (L) speakers come to distinguish phonetic details of shared phonemes in each language (Flege & Eefting, .  Flege, .  Yeni-Komshian, Flege & Liu, ).  For example, Spanish and English share the phoneme /p/, but /p/ in each language is produced with diﬀerent voice-onset-time (VOT) values.  Thus, it is an interesting question whether bilingual or L speakers exhibit accurate phonetic realizations of Spanish /p/ and English /p/ when speaking the two languages.  While phonetic category formation in production has been investigated extensively in adult bilingual and L speakers (see Flege, .  Bohn & Munro, , for more information), little such research has been carried out with bilingual children, although more robust ﬁndings have been reported in the perceptual domain.
