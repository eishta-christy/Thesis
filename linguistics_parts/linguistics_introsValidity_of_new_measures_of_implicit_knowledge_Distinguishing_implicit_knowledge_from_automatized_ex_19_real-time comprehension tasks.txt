 The issue of implicit and explicit knowledge and learning mechanisms has attracted attention from many second language acquisition (SLA) researchers because of its theoretical and educational implications (e. g. , Hulstijn, 2005).  To tackle the issues surrounding explicit and implicit knowledge and learning (e. g. , interface issues), the methodological problem of measuring implicit knowledge is crucial (Suzuki & DeKeyser, 2017).  Explicit and implicit knowledge are distinguished based on awareness.  implicit knowledge is deployed without awareness, whereas explicit knowledge requires some level of awareness (DeKeyser, 2003.  Williams, 2009).  Previous SLA studies have shown empirically that explicit and implicit knowledge are distinct constructs that can be measured separately (Bowles, 2011.  R.  Ellis, 2005.  Gutiérrez, 2013.  Zhang, 2015).  A recent study, however, employed a more ﬁnely tuned psycholinguistic technique to examine real-time grammar processing and cast doubt on the validity of existing implicit knowledge measures (Suzuki & DeKeyser, 2015.  Vafaee, Suzuki, & Kachinske, 2017).  The present paper reports a construct validation study of a new battery of ﬁnely tuned tests for implicit knowledge.  the eye-tracking-while-listening task, the wordmonitoring task, and the self-paced reading task.  These real-time comprehension tasks were compared with the existing tasks that have been claimed to measure implicit knowledge, for example, timed grammaticality judgment tests (GJT), which were hypothesized to draw more on automatized explicit knowledge in this study.
