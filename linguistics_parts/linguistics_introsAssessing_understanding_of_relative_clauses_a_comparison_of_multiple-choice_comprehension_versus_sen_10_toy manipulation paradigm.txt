INTRODUCTION.  In the course of typical language development children produce relative clauses as early as around three years of age (Crain, McKee & Emiliani, .  Diessel & Tomasello, .  Jisa & Kern, .  Limber, ).  However, research suggests that across languages their comprehension of the same structures does not emerge until two to three years later (de Villiers, Tager-Flusberg, Hakkuta & Cohen, .  Goodluck & Tavakolian, .  Håkansson & Hansson, .  Sheldon, ).  The majority of the comprehension studies cited here use a toy manipulation paradigm where the child uses toys to act out a spoken sentence, and although significant variation is reported within their results, studies that compare production and comprehension directly (using a number of methodologies) (e. g.
