The present study investigates cross-situational word learning in school-age foreign language (FL) learners.  Further, it takes an individual difference framework, exploring learner variables that may affect cross-situational learning in school-age FL learners.  FL learners constantly encounter ambiguous situations (Ely, 1989).
