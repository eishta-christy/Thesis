INTRODUCTION.  Increasingly, there are calls – in contexts of the global, geopolitical South especially – for decoloniality, and there is a respectable and growing body of literature in disciplines such as history, sociology, literature, philosophy and linguistics that are taking the ‘decolonial turn’ (Maldonado-Torres 2011).  Quijano (2000) introduced the notion of decoloniality to emphasize the need to move away from ‘continuing’ coloniality – what Mignolo (1995) refers to as ‘the darker side of modernity’, distinguishing four axes relevant to the enduring colonial matrix of power.  • economic (appropriating land, and control of the economy).  • political (maintaining authority).  • civic life (where gender and sexuality are controlled with Western heteropatriarchal discursive practices).  and • epistemological (pertaining to subjectivity, identity, control, distortion and erasure of knowledge).  In Maldonado-Torres’ (2011.  2) words, Coloniality .  .  .  refers to long-standing patterns of power that emerged as a result of colonialism, but that define culture, labor, intersubjective relations and knowledge production well beyond the strict limits of colonial administrations.  Thus, coloniality survives colonialism.  Decoloniality, then, is a political and epistemic (and spiritual) project to delink from modern colonial designs (Mignolo 2011).  It is the dismantling of relations of power and conceptions of knowledge that foment the reproduction of racial, gender and geo-political hierarchies that came into being or found new and more powerful forms of expression in the modern/colonial world.  (Maldonado-Torres 2011.  117) The decolonial turn has many roots and offshoots.  ‘heightened perception of the linkages between colonialism, racism and other forms of dehumanization in the twentieth century, the formation of ethnic movements of empowerment and feminisms of colour, and the appearance of queer decolonial theorizing’ (Maldonado-Torres 2011.  2).  The many manifestations of decoloniality share a perception of coloniality as a continuing concern in the contemporary world.  An important dimension of enduring coloniality is the ‘knowledge’ we have of our embodied, gendered, racialized and sexualized selves, and the praxes/ practices through which these selves can be inserted into the everyday.  Concepts of gender and race that evolved out of imperial coloniality remain tightly imbricated in contemporary forms of coloniality/modernity.  The ‘voices’ with which we speak ourselves and the scripts that we follow in these respects remain those of colonial discourse.  Conceptualizations of gender that articulate with race are reproduced through specific global sociopolitical forms of political organization, as well as circulated across the globe in Western heteropatriarchal discourses of entertainment and thought.  Mohanty (2003.  514) notes how modern-day manifestations of coloniality ‘global capitalism and neoliberal policies writes its script especially in the bodies and lives of women and girls from the third world’.  In the postapartheid context of South Africa, the intersectionalities of race, gender and economic disparities underlie widespread practices of patriarchy, rape and sexual discrimination.  However, despite the intimacy and carnality of the coloniality nexus of sex, gender and race, Arboleda-Rıos (2014) notes that ‘the ways in which lesbian, homosexual, bisexual, transgender and/or queer subjects confront interlocking systems of oppression have been consistently disregarded’ by the decoloniality collective.  Furthermore, the connections between enduring racialization and the production of race and sexuality remain in need of explication.  Mbembe (2017.  55) makes the point that ‘our critique of modernity will remain incomplete if we fail to grasp that the coming of modernity coincided with the appearance of the principle of race’.  He goes on to say that ‘[i]n order to reproduce itself, the principle of race depends on an assemblage of practices whose immediate and direct target is the body of the Other and whose scope is life in general’ (2017.  56) – including, importantly, sexuality.  In her much-cited, seminal work on decolonial feminism, Lugones (2010) explicates the mutual co-constitution of gender and race in practices of slavery and colonization.  And Sally Kitch (2009.  169) notes how ‘sexual difference and the gender binary became basic tenets of the ideology of racial hierarchy and white supremacy during processes of nation formation in the West’.  Gunkel (2010.  11) explains that, through hypersexualizing the (black) Other, ‘colonialism constituted race as a sexualised category, and sexuality a racialized category.  However, it was not only heterosexuality that was racially constructed, but also divergent sexualities’.  Drag and decoloniality.  One area in which these complex interactions are literally on show and open to reflection is the drag performance.  Drag shows are arguably a form of decolonial aesthetic or decolonial aestheSis (Mignolo and Vasquez 2013), a dimension of decoloniality that seeks to replace the coloniality of traditional aesthetics with alternative ways of sensing and perceiving.  They are typical instances of performances that seek to parody and disrupt colonialities of gender or sexuality, by showing that they are in no way ‘natural’ or stable, as we are led to believe.  Although much has been written on drag queens, less is known about how drag kings go about the task of disrupting sexuality and gender.  A drag king is most often (but not always) a woman who dresses up in costume that is recognizably masculine, and who performs theatrically in that costume (Halberstam 1997, 1998, 2001).  Mu~noz (1999.  99) remarks on how queer performances allow performers and their audiences (through disidentification) to resist ‘the interpellating call of ideology that fixes a subject within the state power apparatus’.  Halberstam (1998) argues that the subversive power of the drag performance lies in the fact that drag parades discontinuities between gender and sex or appearance and reality, but doesn’t allow these discontinuities to be read as dysfunction (as they would be in ordinary circumstances).  Instead, these inconsistencies become a site of gender creativity (cf.  Butler 1996), and there is thus a strong claim here to be disrupting normativities of masculinity through holding them up for laughter.  However, genres (including performance genres) are sites of social (re) production – of people, persona, place and registers – as much as they invite social change.  They are therefore also a potential carrier of global-colonial structurations (global circulation).  Shome (2000.  367) has argued that ‘cultural products such as texts, .  .  .  legitimize and reproduce – the genre allows gender and race to shift location, and to appear anew’ thereby reproducing patterns in ‘the everyday organization of social and cultural relations [which] function to confer benefits and systemic advantage to whites’ (cf.  Williams and Stroud 2014).  The question then becomes in what ways, and to what extent, do performance genres such as drag king further a decolonial critique of the colonialities of the body.  that is, gender, sexuality and race and their embodiment.  In what sense can they be seen as articulations of a decolonial aesthetics.  Do drag shows break ‘silences, disrup[ting] dominant narratives and create a transformative consciousness’, as Cervantes and Salda~na claim to be the case for hip hop and nueva cancion (2015.  84).  Do they provide a means to ‘delink from coloniality and exercise a “decolonial imaginary”’ (Perez 1999.  5).  In this paper, we approach these questions with a close analysis of four excerpts from two performances by a troupe of drag kings called Bros B4 Ho’s (sic)2 who promote themselves as ‘South Africa’s first ever Drag King troupe’. 3 In interviews the motivation behind their performances is presented as clearly political in nature (OUT Africa Magazine 2012) and, on the group’s Facebook page, the kings explain that they ‘use satire, irony, and parody .  .  .  to subvert cultural hegemony and conventions and empower them[selves]’.  It’s clear that, to them, resisting and disrupting hegemony is a big part of their project.  On the basis of our analysis of the drag king troupe, we argue that deconstructions of gendered relationships, or the remapping of sexualities across gender categories, or the erasure of simple gender binaries oftentimes implicate the continued production and circulation of racial and sexual hierarchy.  In fact, we make a stronger claim.  that the continued circulation of stereotypes of race and sexuality are the very means whereby heteronormativity is deconstructed in these performances.  In other words, not performing blackness is a prerequisite for the performativity of masculinity.  At the same time, we show that there are moments of genre rupture in the drag king performance that destabilize the simple reproduction of colonialities of race and sexuality.  In making this argument, we take an approach to language and social life inspired by the work of Frantz Fanon, a post-colonial philosopher and writer born in French-colonized Martinique, who shaped the way we think about colonialism and anti-black racism today.  His most well-known works were published in the 1950s and 1960s, largely in response to his experiences of racism when studying in France, as well as his involvement in the Algerian National Liberation Front fighting against French colonization.  In the very first line in the very first chapter of Black Skin, White Masks he notes the ‘fundamental importance’ of language, considering it ‘essential for providing us with one element in understanding the black man’s dimension of being-forothers’ (2008.  1).  In particular, we use a Fanonian perspective on body, violence and language to frame our discussion of performance, genre and subjectification in the next section.  Following this, we present the drag troupe together with a brief review of some key literature on drag.  This will provide the foundation for a study of two performances in Cape Town.  We conclude the paper with a discussion on the implications of drag for decoloniality (informed through a Fanonian stance), and the possible contribution a Fanonian approach can make to sociolinguistics more generally.  <Middle> A FANONIAN LENS ON SOCIOLINGUISTICS.  Although little used by linguists (but cf.  Burnett and Milani in press), a Fanonian approach to language opens up some enticing possibilities for thinking about the role of language in the global circulation of enduring racialization and its semiotics.  Central concepts in Fanon’s thought pertain to the body, violence and language, and, even though Fanon wrote almost 70 years ago, his accounts of the existential formation of race retain a troubling currency in contemporary society.  The central problematic of Fanon’s oeuvre is the fact of blackness as a White semiotic construction, one that depends on, and is continually reinforced by, (failed) encounters with whiteness.  Blackness is forged on the anvil of structural whiteness in a violence of language, and ‘woven out of a thousand details, anecdotes and stories’ (Fanon 1967.  111).  Race, in Mbembe’s (2017) words, is an assemblage, cobbled together in the intersubjective, social world of culture, history, language and economics – a world symbolically and semiotically constituted by humans.  It is this world of representation and interaction that determines the forms in which blackness may emerge.  Fanon calls the process of fabricating blackness sociogeny, whereby the symbolic and semiotic is made materiality and flesh.  The most famous example of sociogeny is Fanon’s telling of how he is interpellated, while walking the streets of Paris, by a young (white) Parisian boy who shouts.  ‘Look, a negro!’ This hailing, which Fanon at first found amusing, alerted him to how his body – his general corporeal schema – had in that moment been overtaken by a racial epidermal schema.  .  .  .  my body was given back to me sprawled out, distorted, recolored, clad in mourning in that white winter day.  The Negro is an animal, the Negro is bad, the Negro is mean, the Negro is ugly.  (Fanon 1967.  112) When Fanon recounts this story, he notes how he is made to appear to himself as an epidermis, a becoming-skin, a historical-racial body schema (seen through a third person consciousness).  He contrasts this ‘self’ as a becomingskin with a body-schema, or a phenomenological sense of self, that normally emerges out of the everyday ‘remnants of feelings and notions of the tactile, vestibular, kinesthetic or visual nature’ (1967.  91), ‘owned’ by the perceiving and acting subject (cf.  Merleau-Ponty 1996).  The epidermilization, or becoming skin (Fanon’s concept of the body), is at the same time an internalization.  In fact, as pointed out by Gorgis (2015.  86) ‘“becoming-skin” suspends rather than reinforces the distinction between interiority and exteriority’.  Becoming skin is thus ‘the process by which the exteriority of the skin internalizes affects’ (2015.  86).  Fanon coins the term scissiparite (self-division or self cleaving) or fissiparousness (a reproductive process by means of fission) to capture this form of enforced subjectification.  Fanon refers to becoming-skin, as living in the zone of non-being.  The Black, reduced to inhabiting a two-dimensional body, has no inner life that is recognized as interactively engaging in his/her own subjectification.  There is no recognition in the sociogeny of Blackness that s/he is anything more than surface appearances.  One implication of this is that, if the Black has no inner life worth engaging with intersubjectively, then everything that can be ‘known’ can be sourced from his/her surface.  Thus, the Black is a victim of epistemic closure, ‘sealed in a world without reciprocity or the intersubjectively social’ (Gordon 2015.  48–49), existing only in the zone of non-being.  In order to become fully human, to have a recognized inner life that goes beyond the interiorization of the exteriority of the racial epidermal schema, the Black subject must transcend the boundaries of race.  However, there is a repeated ‘failure’ of the black body to enter the world – to emerge into a world where the standards of humanity are determined by and as whiteness – other than as an object.  In Black Skin, White Masks, each chapter elaborates on a different aspect of the failure of black attempts to gain recognition of their humanity.  With respect to language, Fanon (2008.  3) notes how ‘the black man who has lived in France for a certain time returns home radically transformed’.  ‘speaking pidgin means imprisoning the black man and perpetuating a conflictual situation where the white man infects the black man with extremely toxic foreign bodies’ (2008.  19).  addressing a black man in pidgin means ‘you stay where you are’ (2008.  17).  According to Fanon (1967.  1), ‘to speak is to exist absolutely for the other’.  The world and what is human is defined by the white as white.  For the purposes of this paper, Fanon’s complex understanding of how (female) gender (and the exclusion or denial of femininities) mediates the (sexual) construction of black male disempowerment is of particular relevance.  Firstly, the gaze or power of interpellation that reduces the black body to an exteriority or ‘lack’ is in psychoanalytic thought a prerogative of the (white) male.  The black male who is denied this gaze, becoming instead its ‘object’, is thus refused a fundamental ‘privilege’ of masculinity.  The disempowerment is accentuated even more if the gaze that constructs the black body is feminine (thus also reversing gender roles).  in an episode recounted by Fanon (1967.  94), a woman exclaims ‘Look how handsome that Negro is’ and the powerful retort, ‘Fuck you, madame’ testifies to the added dismemberment felt by the black male from being objectified in a female gaze (cf.  Bergner 1995).  Secondly, Fanon discusses the gendered differences between black men and women in how they desire and attempt to inhabit whiteness.  In Black Skin, White Masks, he strongly critiques Mayotte Capecia’s (1948.  202) comment in her autobiography Je suis Martiniquaise, ‘I should have liked to be married but to a white man’, condemning her reproduction of racist ideology.  Bergner (1995.  86) remarks on how ‘black women’s attempts to inhabit a whiteness that Fanon consistently defines in masculine terms becomes mimicry, a feminine masquerade both of race and gender’.  In this comment, black femininity is de-subjectivized.  Thus, gender and sexuality figure prominently in Fanon’s thought in the construction of the black male.  Fanon’s concern with appearance as subjectification (how what can appear in what guise and when, under what conditions), the notion of sociogeny as the site where collective racial narratives become individualized, embodied subjectivities, the metatheory of failure as the generative process in the construction of black identities, together with the role of sexuality and gender in the construction of the black male, provides an interesting perspective from which to study drag.  Performance more generally is a site for highly coordinated and public displays of cultural reproduction (and contestation.  Bauman 2001), where the communicative act is also put on display for an audience, and is thus objectified and able to be intensely scrutinized with regard to multiple features of its semiotics (cf.  also Coupland 2007).  Because of this, performance is a potentially productive site of resistance to and reindexicalization of cultural stereotypes of sexual and racialized identities.  However, performances acquire this potential through tapping into (globally) circulating discourses and characterological figures and genres that audiences can identify, align with or distance themselves from.  It is also this dimension that opens up performances to reproducing the familiar and the status quo.  Performances are ‘.  .  .  encounters in which individuals establish forms of footing and alignment with voices indexed by speech, and thus with social types of persons, real or imagined .  .  . ’ (Agha 2005.  38).  A Fanonian approach to the sociolinguistics of performance suggests a specific angle of interrogation into the drag genre and its instantiations in the performance, one that explores the drag show as a potential site for the construction of alienating stereotypes of blackness (and sexuality).  We feel that this is a particularly important perspective to ask of a drag performance with decolonial ambitions in contemporary postapartheid South Africa.  Drag shows are an instance of a particular genre that is a complex cluster of speaker types, audience types, technologies, settings and purposes, ‘a constellation of systemically related, co-occurrent formal features and structures that serves as a conventionalized orienting framework for the production and reception of discourse’ (Bauman 2001.  79).  It is a relational event, creating indexical connections across performances (Bauman and Briggs 1990) with ‘other times, other places and persons’ (1992.  147–148), thereby linking to ‘structural whiteness’.  When an utterance is interpreted through its intertextual relationships with prior texts, including prior situational contexts and their constituents (settings, participant roles, scenarios), it transcends the locally produced event (Bauman 2001).  Of particular interest here is the role of genres in reproducing or subverting social power.  Bauman and Briggs (1990) speak of an intertextual gap occurring in the linking of particular utterances to generic models.  These gaps can either be minimized (as in ‘rendering the discourse interpretable through the use of generic precedents’ (Bauman and Briggs 1992.  49) or maximizing the gaps.  With respect to the latter they note that.  Maximizing and highlighting these intertextual gaps underlies strategies for building authority through claims of individual creativity and innovation .  .  .  [resulting in] resistance to the hegemonic structures associated with established genres .  .  . .  (1992.  149) We explore the minimizing and maximizing of intertextual gaps in relation to the production and subversion of Blackness in the drag king show below.  DRAG KINGS IN CAPE TOWN.  PERFORMING A GENRE.  In November 2011, after attending a performance by drag king Johnny Deep at a drag bar in Cape Town called ‘Bubbles Bar’, Catherine Saint Jude Pretorius decided to create her own drag king persona, rapper Saint Dude.  Following a handful of successful performances at the open stage nights at Bubbles, and realizing that other women may also benefit from the catharsis she experienced while performing, Pretorius put out an invitation on the Facebook group ‘Cape Town Lesbians’ for a gathering to discuss the possible formation of a drag king troupe.  Bros B4 Ho’s was formed, now comprising four white performers and two women of colour.  At the time of the study, the troupe was made up of six personas regularly performed by the group.  troupe leader Saint Dude and Umlilo John – the only two kings of colour – both of whom are hip hop characters.  FreDDie, a Freddie Mercury impersonator.  King Cory Lingus and Cole Steel Johnson, white kings who performed mostly rock and pop music.  and Frankie H, a white king who dipped into both hip hop and pop music (Figure 1).  The group performs predominantly in traditionally white spaces in Cape Town.  Pretorius believed that a troupe could provide a safe, supportive space for a woman to experiment with gender-bending performances (Lea 2013).  Frankie H, who at the time described himself as a ‘pre-op trans guy’, said that the troupe was a space in which he could safely dress and behave as a man, and have his masculinity ‘celebrated’.  He went as far as admitting that the affirmation he received while performing with the troupe allowed him to finally make the decision to transition (Frankie H 2012).  Another king, Umlilo John, said that being in Bros B4 Ho’s allowed him to be butch without being ostracized, and that he viewed the troupe as a second family.  it was as though he had gained new brothers and sisters at the same time (Lea 2013).  This cathartic effect that participation in the troupe has on its members, and the options of safely performing other genders has been noted by other authors.  Shapiro (2007.  251) notes how participating in a drag performance may ‘transform the gender identity and politics of the drag performer’ functioning as ‘a form of consciousness raising and a site of identity transformation for performers’ (2007.  251).  As noted earlier, one prime motivation for Pretorius to start the group in the first place was a firm political belief expressed on their Facebook page that ‘[i]n order to debunk the hegemonic power that too often goes unaddressed and unchallenged, we must adopt the empowered personae so that we can expose it’. 3 Furthermore, Pretorius explained that doing drag allowed her to bring the complexities of her (and others’) gender presentation to people’s attention, and to fight for ‘gender presentation without persecution’ (Lea 2013) as part of her gender activism.  Shapiro (2007.  267) adds the caveat, though, that a prerequisite for tapping into the disruptive power of drag is that it is done ‘in a group with an oppositional collective identity, feminist political commitment and collective organizational practices’.  Escudero-Alıas (2011.  257) remarks on ‘relevant queer tools.  camp humor, slapstick’, as strategies of ‘disindentification’ (Mu~noz 1999.  39), that is, survival strategies for resisting hegemonies.  The techniques and practices whereby the Bros B4 Ho’s enact and articulate their subversion of sexual and gender hierarchies are those of satire, irony, parody, performed mostly through musical acts, lip syncing or singing songs.  In general, the decision to sing songs originally performed by male artists is an effective way of using the resources of interdiscursivity to perform masculinity.  Through allusion to previous performances, the audience is invited to associate the meaning-making of the original act with the current performance, and the masculinity of the original singer with that of the drag king.  This is, thus, a chronotopical event which gets its local meaning from similar performances in similar spaces across historical time.  Furthermore, there is a strong drag queen culture in Cape Town, and nearly all the drag queen performances in this city have included queens doing music performances as well-known female singers like Beyonce and Lady Gaga.  It is not surprising, then, that the kings chose to follow the example of the queens around them in designing their act, again testifying to the role of linkages with similar contemporary discourses (Table 1).  The strategies used and the aspects of coloniality that the groups target for subversion depend on the make-up of their performers, a point that a number of authors have captured in the notion of intersectionality.  Moreman and McIntosh (2010), for example, mention that white drag uses camp to ‘exaggerate drag performance’, whereas Latinas ‘focus more on mannerisms and mimicry of the personality portrayed’ (Hobson 2013.  38).  Hobson (2013.  39) notes how ‘when performing in public space, racial and class markers inevitably influence audience and performer interactions’.  One aspect of this was their attempt to shift the conventional racial and sexual parameters of the drag show away from the predominantly white, LGTB spaces in which drag is usually performed in Cape Town to more racially open, predominantly heterosexual spaces.  However, as these spaces are located in what were designated white areas before 1994, the three venues used by this group (Bubbles Bar, Obz Theatre Cafe and Alexander Bar theatre) are situated quite a distance from where the majority of non-white Capetonians are currently living in the former coloured and black townships of the city.  It is therefore unsurprising that the audience at both events was predominantly white and middle class.  For the purposes of this study, we limit our focus to data collected from the only two sit-down performances held by the troupe Bros B4 Ho’s – the first at Obz Theatre Cafe in Observatory in June 2012 and the second in December 2012 at Alexander Bar’s theatre in town.  At these events, the first author actively participated as an audience member, but also took field notes on costumes, songs performed, movements and dance, and the reactions of the crowd.  After each event, any available footage of the show was downloaded off the group’s YouTube channel for closer examination.
