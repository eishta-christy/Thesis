 I N T R O D U C T I O N Decades of research suggests that bilingual infants reach linguistic milestones, such as babbling and producing ﬁrst words, at the same rate as monolingual infants, despite the fact that the input that bilingual infants hear is much more complex (Nicoladis & Genesee, .  Oller, Eilers, Urbano & Cobo-Lewis, .  Pearson, Fernández, Lewedeg & Oller, ).  Bilingual infants are often exposed to two languages from birth, and they must use the speciﬁc properties of this dual input to diﬀerentiate one language from the other.  Despite these unique challenges, bilingual infants form lexical representations for words in each of their languages early on as they quickly begin to incorporate translation equivalents (TEs) into their vocabularies.  TEs, or doublets, are defined as lexical representations that a speaker has in each language for the same concept (e. g. , dog in English and chien in French).  Importantly, by the end of the second year, bilingual children’s vocabularies are composed of an average of approximately % TEs (Bosch & Ramon-Casas, .  David & Wei, .  Pearson, Fernández & Oller, .  Poulin-Dubois, Bialystok, Blaye, Polonia & Yott, ), although there is typically a great deal of variability between children.  This feat is quite impressive as it suggests that bilingual children are able to understand early on in development that two words can mean the same thing.  However, although the acquisition of TEs during infancy is an important part of bilingual vocabulary development, there are still many gaps in the literature on this topic, as most research has centered on case studies, or studies conducted with very small sample sizes.  More importantly, most studies on TE acquisition exclusively utilize parent report measures of vocabulary, and very few studies have investigated the development of TEs over time, using longitudinal designs.  As a result, our knowledge of the rate of TE development during infancy is quite limited.  In order to address these gaps in the literature, two experiments were conducted.  The aim of the ﬁrst experiment was to examine changes in the proportion of TEs on the MacArthur Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) across three developmental time-points.  By documenting TE acquisition in a sample of thirty-four French–English bilingual children at . , . , and . , our goal was to gain a better understanding of how young bilinguals acquire TEs during a period of accelerated vocabulary growth.  A secondary goal of this experiment was to acquire a better understanding of how changes in bilingual input and relative vocabulary size shape TE development, by examining the relation between changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size, and the proportion of TEs.  The aim of the second experiment presented in this paper was to investigate the utility of a direct measure of TE comprehension, and to compare the proportion of TEs derived from this measure with parent report of the same subset of words.  Within the vocabulary development literature, there has been some concern that parents of bilingual children might confound their child’s languages when reporting their receptive word knowledge on vocabulary checklists (Pearson et al. , ) such as the CDI (Fenson et al. , .  Trudeau, Frank & Poulin-Dubois, ).  The goal of this second experiment was to determine whether parent report of TEs mirrors a direct, laboratory-based measure of children’s TE development.  Language exposure.  The amount of time that a child is exposed to each of his or her languages appears to be signiﬁcantly related to vocabulary development in each language, with discrepancies in language exposure often leading to unbalanced vocabulary development (Bedore et al. , .  Bosch & Ramon-Casas, .  David & Wei, .  De Anda, Arias-Trejo, Poulin-Dubois, Zesiger & Friend, a.  De Houwer, .  De Houwer, Bornstein & De Coster, .  Eilers, Pearson & Cobo-Lewis, .  Grüter, Hurtado, Marchman & Fernald, .  Hoﬀ, .  Hurtado, Grüter, Marchman & Fernald, .  Pearson et al. , .  Place & Hoﬀ, .  Poulin-Dubois et al. , .  Thordardottir, ).  Several studies, for example, now show that young bilinguals tend to produce fewer words in each of their individual languages compared to monolingual infants (Core, Hoﬀ, Rumiche & Señor, .  Hoﬀ, Core, Place, Rumiche, Señor & Parra, .  Hoﬀ, Rumiche, Burridge, Ribot & Welsh, .  Oller, Pearson & Cobo-Lewis, .  Pearson, Fernández & Oller, ).  Furthermore, when exposure is unbalanced, children also have a tendency to produce more words in their dominant (L) compared to their non-dominant (L) language (Hurtado et al. , .  Pearson & Fernández, .  Pearson et al. , ).  Interestingly, however, when total (the number of words a child knows) or total conceptual (the number of concepts a child knows) vocabulary are taken into account, bilinguals are typically considered to produce as many words as their monolingual peers (Core et al. , .  Hoﬀ et al. , .  Junker & Stockman, .  Pearson et al. , ).  Given that it is well established that language exposure has a signiﬁcant impact on early vocabulary development, it is reasonable to think that the relative distribution of exposure in each language might also have an impact on the proportion of TEs that a child acquires.  However, whereas balanced exposure should theoretically result in balanced rates of TE acquisition, most children are not equally exposed to the languages that they hear (Hoﬀ, ).  Recent research has shown that although many parents make an eﬀort to provide balanced levels of exposure for their children, generally speaking, strategies such as the one-parent–one-language rule are not eﬀective in achieving this goal (De Houwer, ).  Other factors, such as the language preference of the child, the majority status of the child’s languages, the contexts in which they learn their languages, and individual diﬀerences in the quantity and quality of input speakers provide for the child, all contribute to uneven exposure patterns and, very often, uneven patterns of vocabulary growth (De Houwer, .  MacLeod, Fabiano-Smith, Boegner-Pagé & Fontolliet, .  Place & Hoﬀ, ).  Interestingly, although most bilingual children have at least some TEs in their early receptive and expressive vocabularies (Bosch & Ramon-Casas, .  Byers-Heinlein & Werker, .  De Houwer et al. , .  Deuchar & Quay, .  Genesee & Nicoladis, .  Holowka, Brosseau-Lapre & Petitto, .  Junker & Stockman, .  Nicoladis & Secco, .  Pearson et al. , .  Pearson et al. , .  Quay, .  Schelletter, ), there continues to be some debate in the literature regarding the extent to which quantity of language exposure plays a role in facilitating TE acquisition.  Whereas there is evidence to suggest that children who are raised in environments that are more conducive to balanced language acquisition tend to acquire a greater proportion of TEs early on in development (David & Wei, .  Montanari, .  Pearson et al. , ), there are also studies showing that quantity of L exposure is a poor predictor of how many TEs a child has in their vocabulary (Byers-Heinlein & Werker, .  Lanvers, .  Poulin-Dubois, D. , Blaye, Coutya & Bialystok, ).  Of note is the fact that although there is a great deal of individual variability in the proportion of TEs that a child acquires, we know that TE acquisition generally increases over time in relation to children’s vocabulary production (Montanari, ).  However, although several studies have now examined the process of TE acquisition in young bilinguals, the majority of these studies have been cross-sectional in nature, and few have examined the role that changes in language exposure and vocabulary ratios play in facilitating the acquisition of TEs longitudinally in the course of early vocabulary development.  A main goal of the present study was to examine how changes in relative language exposure and vocabulary size impact TE acquisition in very young bilinguals using a longitudinal design.  Measuring TE acquisition during infancy.  To date, the majority of research on TE acquisition in young bilinguals has been conducted using case studies and parent report measures, such as the CDI (David & Wei, .  De Houwer et al. , .  Junker & Stockman, .  Legacy, Zesiger, Friend & Poulin-Dubois, ).  Although the CDI is well established as a valid and reliable measure of vocabulary development in both monolingual and bilingual infants, and is praised for its quick and easy to use format, there has been some concern that parents of bilingual infants might confound their child’s languages when reporting their word knowledge on vocabulary checklists (Pearson et al. , ).  Importantly, although the CDI should ideally be ﬁlled out by two expert reporters, in the case of bilingual infants this is not always possible, and most often it is the primary caregiver who ﬁlls out both forms of the CDI.  Interestingly, De Houwer, Bornstein, and Leach () showed that single reporter CDI reports often underestimate monolingual children’s RECEPTIVE vocabulary knowledge.  This suggests that inaccurate reporting of vocabulary knowledge by single reporters might also aﬀect bilingual vocabulary estimates, as this task is much more complex for parents of bilingual children.  Whereas trying to diﬀerentiate the words that a bilingual child SAYS in each of their languages can be diﬃcult for parents (Lust et al. , ), trying to diﬀerentiate the words that a child COMPREHENDS in each language can be even more challenging.  As a result, Experiment  was conducted to address this issue.  By assessing the proportion of TEs that infants comprehended using a direct, touch-screen measure of vocabulary comprehension, and comparing these results to parent report of the same subsets of words on the CDI, we were able to determine how accurately parents were able to report on their child’s early comprehension of TEs.  <Middle> The present study.   In order to address gaps in the literature surrounding the acquisition of TEs in early bilingual vocabulary development, two studies were conducted.  Experiment  had two main goals.  (i) to gain a better understanding of how French–English bilinguals acquire TEs over time, by examining changes in the proportion of TEs on the CDI across three developmental time-points.  and (ii) to determine the roles that linguistic input and vocabulary growth play in shaping TE acquisition.  In order to accomplish these goals, TEs in infants’ expressive vocabularies were measured at . , . , and .  using the MacArthur Bates CDI, and changes in language exposure and relative vocabulary size were examined as potential predictors of change in the proportion of TEs across waves.  We hypothesized that more balanced ratios of exposure and productive vocabulary size would be associated with larger proportions of TEs at each wave.  The purpose of Experiment , on the other hand, was to compare a direct, touch-screen measure of infants’ TE comprehension with parent report of the same subset of words.  We conducted this experiment to test the hypothesis that parents may be under- or over-reporting their children’s comprehension of TEs.  In accomplishing these goals, we aimed to acquire a better understanding not only of what TE acquisition looks like during early bilingual vocabulary development, but also how changes in input and relative vocabulary size shape this development, and how we can best measure the acquisition of TEs in bilingual infants’ receptive vocabularies.  By using a longitudinal design, as well as a direct measure of early TE comprehension, we aimed to provide an original contribution to the literature on bilingual vocabulary development.
