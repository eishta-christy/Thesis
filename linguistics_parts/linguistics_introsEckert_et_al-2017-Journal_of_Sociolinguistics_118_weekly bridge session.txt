INTRODUCTION.  Over the past six decades, sociolinguistic research has correlated linguistic variation with many aspects of social behavior.  characteristics of the speakers, of interaction with the listeners, and with the speech situation more generally.  This systematic social variability of form is generally said to have social meaning, hence to be available for social expression.  The ﬁrst quantitative study of a sound change (Labov 1963) showed that locally-constructed social meaning, furthermore, can serve as motivation for sound change.  With the accumulation of survey, ethnographic, and case-study evidence, and with the increasing diversity and sophistication of experimental and statistical methods, the study of sociolinguistic variation is engaging ever more deeply with social meaning.  Our aim in this paper is to explore and clarify the notion of social meaning in variation, its role in phonological change, and its locus in the phonological system.  We argue that social meaning accrues to concrete sounds – to phonetic elements – and not to the phonological structures in which those sounds participate.  For the purposes of this discussion, we define meaning as the conventional association of distinctions in the world with distinctions in linguistic form.  In other words, variables are signs.  Peirce (1931–1935) distinguishes three kinds of signs on the basis of the relation between form and content.  symbols by pure convention, icons by resemblance, and indexes by association in fact.  The indexical realm is based in contiguity within the speech situation, as form ‘points to’ the immediate context from the speaker’s perspective.  While this pointing may serve a referential function, as in the case of spatial and temporal deictics, sociolinguistic variables have no referential function. 1 In the case of morpho-syntactic variables (e. g.  negative concord), the presence of negation is referential, but variation in the number of negative particles is used as an intensifier.  that is, the degree of investment the speaker is making for this proposition (Labov 1984b).  In this case, variation imbues a referential sign with additional, indexical, meaning.  In the case of some lexico-pragmatic variables, such as the use of totally with non-gradable predicates, the semantics of the sign may actually contribute to its indexical potential (Acton and Potts 2014.  Beltrama 2016).  In this paper, we deal exclusively with phonological variation, whose indexicality is entirely independent of reference.  The double articulation of language (Hockett 1960.  Martinet 1968), in which phonology provides meaningless elements to combine to yield meaningful elements, leaves phonological units free to register distinctions in the collective co-existence that is the social world.  We commonly refer to the meaning of variation as ‘social meaning. ’ But in an important sense, all meaning is social inasmuch as it is constructed for the purposes of, and in the course of, social exchange.  The distinction between child and adult is based on conventional notions of what makes someone a child or an adult – notions based in shared understandings of age and development. 2 Even the distinction between a table and a bench is social inasmuch as it is based in conventional understandings of the differential characteristics and uses of these objects.  These conventions will change over time as our needs, activities etc.  affect the distinctions we live by.  While all symbols are social in this sense that they are socially constructed, the meaning of variation is purely social.  It has no reference – it does nothing but index something about the speaker as a social actor in the speech situation.  It is this indexical association that we refer to when we speak of social meaning.  There can be variation without social meaning – a difference in form becomes a sign through a process of enregisterment, as it becomes conventionally associated with some social distinction.  The term ‘enregisterment,’ as introduced by Agha (2003) in the context of the emergence of RP, is most commonly associated with a higher level sign – a register (e. g.  Johnstone, Andrus and Danielson 2006).  Variables become enregistered in the give and take of discourse, as hearers construe a relation between form and some aspect of the speaker in the situation, such as stance (Kiesling 2005) or qualities (Eckert 2016).  Macro-social correlations (i. e.  class, age, gender, ethnicity, geography) are not in themselves indications of social meaning, inasmuch as it is possible for such correlations to be well below the level of social awareness (see, e. g. , Tamminga 2016).  But they do indicate a probability that such meaning is at work at the local level.  For example, gender correlations on a macro-social scale point to the culturally central male-female distinction, which in turn abstracts over a range of globally constrained but locally constructed practices and potentials.  Thus, correlation of a variable with a gender category is likely to index that category only indirectly (Ochs 1991), in virtue of some immediately salient quality that is commonly associated with that gender category, such as refinement, toughness, emotionality or trendiness.  It is at the level of salient qualities that variation is put to use and takes on meaning, and one could even say that the use of a variable to index a quality plays a role in making that quality salient.  The meaning of a variable emerges not simply in the speaker’s production, but in the hearer’s interpretation in the moment.  Working with the highly enregistered and robustly studied (ING) variable, Kathryn Campbell-Kibler has shown that hearers do not interpret the coronal and dorsal variants of (ING) in the same way on every hearing.  Rather, their interpretation in the moment is a function of their mood and of their social perception of the speaker (CampbellKibler 2008).  It is in this process of interpretation that variation takes on meaning, and that this meaning can change.  Like reference, the indexicality of a variable emerges in use and can change over time, along with changes in the social distinctions it picks out.  The potential for continual change in meaning is specifically related to variation in Silverstein’s (2003) notion of orders of indexicality, through which a variable can progress from indexing a social position (e. g.  with a region, a class position, an ethnic group) to indexing some quality apparently associated with the people occupying that social position.  Indexical order primarily concerns change in social meaning.  It is related to levels of awareness, but in a different way from the indicator, marker, stereotype taxonomy which is based on the behavior of speakers in the interview context (Labov 1971).  Both approaches register theoretical points in a continuum of awareness through which variables may progress as they become increasingly enregistered (Agha 2003).  We become aware of indexical orders as variables achieve marker status, but how much awareness is required for a speaker to exercise agency in this process remains an empirical question.  This report will begin by reviewing the evidence for the social meaning of phonological variation, before considering the extent of its intersection with linguistic structure and its role as a driving force in changes within that structure.  It will appear that socially meaningful variation is not equally distributed over all phases of language structure, and that the more abstract categories and processes may not be socially evaluated by users of the language.  We will explore the most characteristic and vigorous domains ofage, gender, ethnicity, geography) are not in themselves indications of social meaning, inasmuch as it is possible for such correlations to be well below the level of social awareness (see, e. g. , Tamminga 2016).  But they do indicate a probability that such meaning is at work at the local level.

We will explore the most characteristic and vigorous domains of social evaluation, yet show how the impact of social meaning can reach beyond its normal limits in the most favorable situations.  <Middle> FIELDS OF EVIDENCE FOR SOCIAL MEANING.  Since meaning is constructed in the interaction between speaker and hearer, evidence of social meaning ultimately must be sought by bringing together data on production and perception.  Over the years, work on perception from the earliest matched guise tests (Lambert et al.  1960) has shown that hearers use phonetic cues to place speakers in the social order, and that those perceived placements evoke a range of social evaluations.  When these placements correspond to production facts (e. g.  Labov 2006 [1966]), there is potential for social meaning.  But if the evaluations associated with those placements are evidence of social meaning, they must be reflected in speakers’ situated use of the variation.  Because the meanings of variables are not fixed but constitute something like an indexical field (Eckert 2008a), the study of perception must find a way to get at situated meaning.  More recent work on perception (e. g.  Campbell-Kibler 2008.  Podesva et al.  2015) has shown that hearers perceive meanings as a function of their perceptions of the context of utterance.  This work is extremely promising, but in its early stages.  In what follows, we will focus on evidence of social meaning in production only.  We take as evidence of social meaning a patterning of variation along some aspect of differentiation in the local social context.  Thus, we find social meaning where variables shift significantly across local social settings and situations, across different communities of practice, and in the speech of individuals who stand out as exceptional or prototypical.  The same individual in varying social settings.  The original studies of the speech community focused on random samples of single speakers, each in a similar social setting – the sociolinguistic interview.  In the interview, the degree of formality is deliberately varied, in order to vary the amount of attention the interviewee pays to his or her speech (Labov 1984a).  The resulting shift of stylistically sensitive variables gives an indirect indication of how they may operate in community interaction.  In actual practice, formality will be only one of a variety of factors giving rise to variability, as will attention to speech.  A direct view of how speakers change their variable resources from one social context to another has been obtained in several studies in which unobtrusive recordings were made of a given individual in changing social settings.  Coupland (1980) recorded the speech of a travel agent in Cardiff over five days at work, talking with friends and work-associates, clients and tour operators, in person and over the telephone.  He examined the shifts of five phonological variables with the status of Cardiff markers across these social contexts, and found that while the topic of conversation was not important in style shifting, channel, friendship status and work relations were.  The speaker’s use of the Cardiff variants decreased from casual chat to informal work-related conversation to talk with clients, and finally to doing business on the telephone.  Coupland also noted that these variables did not all vary in the same way – that the more highly stigmatized stereotypes (h-dropping, intervocalic /t/ flapping, and word-final cluster reduction) appeared regularly in informal speech with her office mates, but quite rarely with clients or on the phone, while the remaining variables showed a more gradual variability across all situations.  In the early stages of the study of Linguistic Change and Variation (henceforward LCV) in Philadelphia (Labov 1980, 2001), Arvilla Payne recorded ‘Carol Meyers’ (CM), a 48-year-old Philadelphia woman whom she knew intimately, over a two-day period.  These recordings took place in three social contexts.  in the travel agency where Carol worked (Office. O).  at dinner with CM’s family (Home. H).  and at a weekly bridge session, featuring lively interaction among four close female friends (Game. G).
