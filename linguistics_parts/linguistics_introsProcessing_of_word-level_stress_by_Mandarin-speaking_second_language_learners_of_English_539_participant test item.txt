The ﬁrst language (L1) is often claimed to be responsible for second language (L2) learners’ (in)ability to process particular sounds in the target language.  However, the conditions under which the L1 facilitates or inhibits the learning of new sounds are unclear, especially in the suprasegmental domain.  Theoretical models such as Flege’s (1995) speech learning model and Best’s (1995) perceptual assimilation model predict L2 learners’ performance based on the phonetic similarity between L1 and L2 sounds.  However, most of the evidence in support of these (and other) L2 speech perception models comes from studies that focus on consonants (e. g. , Best, McRoberts, & Goodell, 2001.  Best, McRoberts, & Sithole, 1988.  Flege & Hillenbrand, 1986.  Flege, Munro, & Mackay, 1995.  Flege, Takagi, & Mann, 1996) and vowels (e. g. , Flege, 1987.  Flege, Bohn, & Jang, 1997.  Flege, Munro, & Fox, 1994.  Fox, Flege, & Munro, 1995).  L2 learners’ processing of suprasegmental information has been the focus of less research, and it is therefore less well understood.  Studies have shown that whether suprasegmental cues contribute to distinguishing among words in the L1, and how they do so, inﬂuences L2 learners’ use of these cues in the L2 (for discussion, see Cutler, 2012).  Existing L2 studies on lexical tones have shown that how different aspects of fundamental frequency (F0.  e. g. , pitch direction and pitch height) signal lexical identity in the L1 largely determines how L2 learners perceive and process tones in the target language (e. g. , Francis, Ciocca, Ma, & Fenn, 2008.  Hall´e, Chang, & Best, 2004.  Leather, 1987.  Lee, Vakock, & Wurm.  1996.  Stagray & Downs, 1993.  Wang, Spence, Jongman, & Sereno, 1999.  Wayland & Guion, 2004).  By contrast, previous research on the perception and processing of stress has focused on the degree of similarity or difference between the L1 and L2 stress systems (i. e. , whether or not stress falls on the same syllable vs.  on different syllables across words.  Dupoux, Pallier, Sebasti´an, & Mehler, 1997.  Dupoux, Peperkamp, & Sebasti´an-Gall´es, 2001.  Dupoux, Sebasti´an-Gall´es, Navarrete, & Peperkamp, 2008.  Peperkamp & Dupoux, 2002.  Peperkamp, Vendelin, & Dupoux, 2010.  Tremblay, 2008, 2009), and not so much on the speciﬁc suprasegmental cues (e. g. , F0, duration, and intensity) that instantiate stress in the L1 versus the L2 (but see Cooper, Cutler, & Wales, 2002.  Lin, Wang, Idsardi, & Xu, 2014.  Ortega-Llebaria, Hong, & Fan, 2013.  Zhang & Francis, 2010).  Hence, it is unclear whether the L2 processing of word-level stress is determined by how suprasegmental cues contribute to lexical identity in the L1.  The present study sheds further light on this question by investigating L2 learners’ use of F0 and duration cues in the processing of word-level stress.  More speciﬁcally, this study examines whether a cue-weighting theory of speech perception (e. g. , Francis & Nusbaum, 2002.  Holt & Lotto, 2006.  Ingvalson, Holt, & McClelland, 2011.  Zhang & Francis, 2010) can explain L2 learners’ ability to process word-level stress.  It does so by comparing the processing of stress in L2 learners of English who speak Standard Mandarin (SM) or Taiwan Mandarin (TM) as L1 dialects and who are at a similar proﬁciency in English.  As will be shown below, SM, but not TM, instantiates word-level stress with the use of duration.  This study investigates whether native SM and native TM listeners who have learned English as L2 differ in their ability to use duration as a cue to stress.  An additional contribution of this study is that it investigates the effect of the L1 dialect on L2 learners’ use of suprasegmental cues to stress.  L2 PERCEPTION AND PROCESSING OF WORD-LEVEL STRESS.  Stress is lexically contrastive in languages such as English, Dutch, and Spanish.  For instance, in English, record (noun) and record (verb) form a minimal pair with respect to stress placement.  By contrast, languages such as French or Finnish do not have word-level stress.  To illustrate, in French, the ﬁnal syllable of the last word in a phrase is accented, with this accent functioning as a boundary marker for words or phrases (e. g. , Jun & Fougeron, 2000, 2002.  Vaissi`ere, 1991.  Welby, 2006) but not distinguishing among segmentally identical words.  Languages thus differ in whether or not stress contributes to lexical identity.  Native speakers of languages that have contrastive stress have little difﬁculty encoding stress in L2 words or in nonwords.  Using four cross-modal priming experiments and two forced-choice identiﬁcation experiments, Cooper et al.  (2002) showed that Dutch-speaking L2 learners of English, who use stress to recognize Dutch words, were quite successful at using the suprasegmental cues of English stress to recognize English words.  Similarly, Dupoux and colleagues have shown that native Spanish listeners are successful in distinguishing and recalling nonwords that differ in stress (Dupoux et al. , 2001, 2008.  Peperkamp et al. , 2010).  In contrast, native speakers of languages that do not have contrastive stress have difﬁculty processing word-level stress.  Using a sequence-recall task, Dupoux and colleagues showed that native French-speaking listeners, but not native Spanishspeaking listeners, had difﬁculty encoding stress when listening to nonwords (Dupoux et al. , 2001.  Peperkamp & Dupoux, 2002).  To explain these ﬁndings, they proposed that listeners’ (in)ability to distinguish stress contrast is determined by whether, within the ﬁrst 2 years of life, they set the stress parameter to encode stress in their phonological representation of lexical words (Peperkamp, 2004.  Peperkamp & Dupoux, 2002).  For languages without contrastive stress (e. g. , French), infants are predicted to observe stress regularity across words and thus not encode stress in their mental lexicon, which was considered the cause of their so-called stress deafness.  This stress deafness was observed not only in native French-speaking listeners but also in proﬁcient French-speaking L2 learners of Spanish (Dupoux et al. , 2008) and in simultaneous French–Spanish bilinguals who were French dominant (Dupoux, Peperkamp, & Sebasti´an-Gall´es, 2010).  This suggests that for L2 learners who do not have contrastive stress in their dominant language, the difﬁculty in processing word-level stress is very robust.  Recent studies indicate that the mechanism underlying stress processing may not operate in an all or none fashion.  Subtle differences between L1 and L2 prosodic systems can also inﬂuence L2 learners’ processing of stress (e. g. , Tremblay, 2008, 2009).  For instance, Tremblay (2008) found that not all French-speaking L2 learners were “stress-deaf”.  in her study, several French Canadian L2 learners of English were able to use the stress contrast to distinguish between competing L2 word candidates.  One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the ﬁndings of Tremblay and those of Dupoux and colleagues, in addition to methodological differences between the two sets of studies, is that speakers of Canadian French may have less difﬁculty than speakers of European French in using stress contrast for L2 lexical access because of the greater contrast between strong and weak syllables in Canadian French as compared to European French (for a discussion, see Tremblay, 2008, 2009).  Another possible explanation is that speakers of Canadian French may have less difﬁculty using stress contrast for L2 lexical access because the speciﬁc suprasegmental cues that signal English stress (e. g. , F0, duration, and intensity) may be used more in Canadian French than in European French.  In the realm of L2 speech perception, empirical research has demonstrated that surface phonetic details can play an important role in determining the difﬁculties that L2 learners may experience in L2 speech perception.  The cue-weighting theory of speech perception (e. g. , Francis et al. , 2008.  Francis & Nusbaum, 2002.  Gandour, 1983.  Holt & Lotto, 2006.  Ingvalson et al. , 2011.  Zhang & Francis, 2010) highlights the importance of these phonetic details, as it is concerned with how acoustic cues that signal a speciﬁc contrast are weighed in different languages and how differences in this weighting affect L2 speech perception and processing.  According to this theory, speech perception is multidimensional, and acoustic cues are weighed differently across categories and across languages.  Although multiple cues are simultaneously available to listeners, these cues are not weighed equally, and they often have “trading relations” (e. g. , Repp, 1982), with increased sensitivity to one cue being accompanied by decreased sensitivity to another cue.  Listeners from different language backgrounds tune in to different acoustic cues in the same stimuli depending on how these cues are used to signal a contrast inA clear example of the relevance of cue weighting exists for the perception of /l/ and /ɹ/ by Japanese L2 learners of English, as illustrated in Iverson, Kuhl, AkahaneYamada, Diesch, Tohkura, Kettermann, and Siebert (2003).  Prior studies had found that Japanese listeners had great difﬁculty distinguishing between English /l/ and /ɹ/ (Bradlow, Pisoni, Yamada, & Tohkura, 1997.  Lively, Logan, & Pisoni, 1993.  Logan, Lively, & Pisoni, 1991.  Yamada, 1995).  In their comparison of native English listeners and Japanese- and German-speaking L2 learners of English, Iverson et al.  (2003) showed that English listeners discriminated the native /l/–/ɹ/ contrast using the third formant (F3).  In contrast, Japanese listeners were more sensitive to the second formant (F2) than to F3, probably because the Japanese liquid is perceptually more similar to English /l/, which is often cued by a low F2, than to English /ɹ/, which is often cued by a low F3 (e. g. , Aoyama, Flege, Guion, Yamada, & Akahane-Yamada, 2004).  Because Japanese listeners did not pay sufﬁcient attention to F3, they found it difﬁcult to perceive the English contrast.  Although German /ʁ/ differs from English /ɹ/, German listeners, unlike Japanese listeners, were able to distinguish English /l/ and /ɹ/ because of their sensitivity to F3.  Japanese listeners’ perceptual difﬁculty was attributed to their sensitivity to unhelpful F2 information, whereas German listeners’ perceptual sensitivity was attributed to their sufﬁcient attention to F3, a critical cue for distinguishing English /l/ and /ɹ/ (for a model that similarly predicts L2 learners’ perception of L2 categories on the basis of the mapping between L1 phonetic cues and the corresponding L1 categories, see Escudero, 2005, 2009.  Escudero & Boersma,Like segments, multiple suprasegmental cues (i. e. , F0, duration, and intensity) contribute to the realization of word-level stress (e. g. , Beckman, 1986.  Fry, 1955.  Lieberman, 1961) and more generally to lexical identity (e. g. , in lexical tones.  Chao, 1968.  Duanmu, 2007).  Moreover, languages with word-level stress differ in the extent to which suprasegmental cues contribute relevant information for lexical access.  For instance, native English listeners have been shown to make limited use of suprasegmental cues to stress, as English stress is also signaled by segmental information (full vs.  reduced vowels).  as a result, English listeners’ word recognition is not inhibited by errors in stress placement unless these errors result in segmental (i. e. , vowel quality) changes in the word (Braun, Lemh¨ofer, & Mani, 2011.  Cutler, 1986.  Cutler & Clifton, 1984.  Cutler, Wales, Cooper, & Janssen, 2007.  Fear, Cutler, & Butterﬁeld, 1995.  Small, Simon, & Goldberg, 1988).  Likewise, native English listeners rely less on suprasegmental cues to English stress than do Dutch-speaking L2 learners of English, because vowel reduction is more frequent in English than in Dutch (Cooper et al. , 2002.  Cutler et al. , 2007).  This suggests that the language-speciﬁc weighting of cues to English stress affects how listeners from different language backgrounds process it.  <Middle> THE PRESENT STUDY.  The present study further investigates whether the L2 learners’ processing of stress is determined by the degree to which individual suprasegmental cues contribute to lexical identity in the L1.  It does so by focusing on an L1-L2 pairing that has been the object of relatively little research.  Mandarin-speaking L2 learners of English (but see Chrabaszcz, Win, Lin, & Idsardi, 2014.  Lin et al. , 2014.  Wang, 2008.  Zhang & Francis, 2010).  Suprasegmental cues have a greater functional load in Mandarin than in English, because Mandarin words with different lexical tones (signaled primarily by F0 cues) have different meanings (e. g. , [m¯a] “mother,” [m´a] “hemp,” [mˇa] “horse,” and [m`a] “scold”.  Chao, 1968.  Duanmu, 2007)1 .  although English has word-level stress, it has few words that can be distinguished only in the suprasegmental cues to stress (e. g. , trusty vs.  trustee.  Cutler, 1986.  Cutler & Clifton, 1984).  Two target Mandarin varieties, SM and TM, are the focus of the present study.  SM is based on the Beijing dialect (i. e. , Putonghua) and spoken by the people of Mainland China, whereas TM is spoken by the people of Taiwan and, thus, inﬂuenced by Taiwanese (i. e. , Southern Min).  Because SM and TM share the above tonal system, they both use F0 as the primary suprasegmental cue to lexical identity (e. g. , Howie, 1976.  Liu & Samuel, 2004).  Although duration is a secondary cue to lexical tones in Mandarin, it is much less reliable than F0 to signal word identity, because the duration of the tone is affected by its position in the word and in the sentence (e. g. , Howie, 1976.  Lai, Sui, & Yuan, 2010.  Liu & Samuel, 2004.  Nordenhake & Svantesson, 1983.  Shen, 1993).  For instance, tones have shorter durations in non–word-ﬁnal than in word-ﬁnal positions, and they have shorter durations in non–phrase-ﬁnal than in phrase-ﬁnal positions (Nordenhake & Svantesson, 1983.  Shen, 1993).  yet Chinese listeners recognize them despite this variability in duration.  It is important to note that SM and TM differ in the extent to which duration signals lexical identity, because only SM has word-level stress, and the primary suprasegmental cue to stress contrasts is precisely duration.  SM has a stress pattern that contrasts stressed–stressed and stressed–unstressed disyllabic words (e. g. , respectively, ['tʊ̄ ŋ'ɕī] “west and east” vs.  ['tʊ̄ ŋɕi] “stuff,” both written as ͈㺫.  Chao, 1968.  Duanmu, 2007).  The second syllable of stressed–unstressed words (e. g. , ['tʊ̄ ŋɕi]) is consistently shorter than the second syllable of stressed– stressed words (e. g. , ['tʊ̄ ŋ'ɕī].  Chen & Xu, 2006.  Lee & Zee, 2010.  Lin, 1985.  Lin & Yan, 1980).  Duration is thus a robust cue, hence the primary perceptual cue, to this stress contrast (e. g. , Lin, 1985).  The second syllable of stressed– unstressed words also carries a neutral tone that can vary in F0 depending on the lexical tone carried by the preceding syllable.  the F0 contour of the neutral tone can be characterized as midfalling after a high-level tone, high falling after a rising tone, midlevel after a dipping tone, and low falling after a high falling tone (Lee & Zee, 2010).  F0 is thus a secondary cue to this stress contrast (Lin, 1985).  Although unstressed syllables in Standard Mandarin are also reduced, vowel reduction has not been deemed important as a cue to Mandarin stress, at least as compared to English stress (e. g. , Lin, 1985.  Zhang & Francis,By contrast, TM does not have this stress distinction.  disyllabic words have the stressed–stressed pattern, and the second syllable of disyllabic words is not reduced (e. g. , ['tʊ̄ ŋ'ɕī] “west and east” vs.  ['tʊ̄ ŋ'ɕī] “stuff,” both written as Ო 㺫.  Kubler, 1985.  Swihart, 2003).  Unlike in SM, the second syllable of ['tʊ̄ ŋ'ɕī] “stuff” is not shorter than the second syllable of ['tʊ̄ ŋ'ɕī] “west and east” in TM, and the second syllable of the two words do not differ in intensity either (Huang, 2011, 2012).  As the second syllable of disyllabic words in TM is not reduced, the neutral tone carried by this second syllable does not vary in F0 depending on the lexical tone carried by the preceding syllable.  this neutral tone often has a low F0 regardless of the preceding tone (Huang, 2011, 2012).  Hence, given the absence of stressed–unstressed words in TM, duration appears to be a relatively less important cue to lexical identity in TM than it is in SM.  Existing L2 studies on Mandarin listeners’ processing of English stress have yielded mixed ﬁndings.  Using a forced-choice word class identiﬁcation task (e. g. , DEsert as noun vs.  deSERT as verb), Zhang and Francis (2010) found that Mandarin-speaking L2 learners of English from Mainland China but tested in the United States, who were a middle to high proﬁciency level (i. e. , 7 as an average self-evaluation score in a 10-point scale), relied more on vowel quality (i. e. , F1–F3) than on suprasegmental cues to English stress and did not differ from native English listeners in their use of F0 and duration cues.  However, using a forced-choice English stress identiﬁcation task (i. e. , stress on ﬁrst syllable vs.  second syllable), Wang (2008) found that Mandarin-speaking L2 learners of English from Mainland China and tested in China (whose English proﬁciency was not reported) did not rely on segmental cues and used only F0 as a cue to English stress.  These inconsistent ﬁndings may stem in part from the potentially different proﬁciencies of the L2 learners that were tested.  Speciﬁcally, the L2 learners who lived in the United States (Zhang & Francis, 2010) may have been more proﬁcient than those who lived in China (Wang, 2008).  Lin et al.  (2014) remedied this problem by examining the processing of English stress in proﬁciency-matched SM- and Korean-speaking L2 learners of English.  Unlike English and SM, Korean does not have word-level stress (Jun, 2005.  Sohn, 1999).  Participants completed a sequence-recall task (Experiment 1) and a lexical decision task (Experiment 2).  in the latter, words were selected such that their incorrect stress placement affected (humane as /'hjumən/ vs.  /hjə'mejn/) or did not affect (e. g. , enough as /'ɪnʌf/ vs.  /ɪ'nʌf/) vowel quality.  The results of Experiment 1 revealed that the Mandarin group had an advantage over the Korean group in encoding stress in English nonwords.  The results of Experiment 2 showed that vowel quality did not affect stress processing in either L2 group.  These results suggest that suprasegmental cues to stress (including F0 and duration, which were not isolated in this study) enhanced stress processing only in the group for which these cues signaled lexical identity in the L1 (e. g. , the SM group).  However, no research (to our knowledge) to date has investigated whether L2 learners whose L1 does not have word-level stress (e. g. , TM) can transfer the use of a suprasegmental cue (here, F0) from a different phonological category (i. e. , lexical tones) to word-level stress in the L2.  Furthermore, it is unclear whether L2 learners differ in their ability to use a particular suprasegmental cue to stress (here, duration) as a function of the relative weight of that cue in the L1 (e. g. , SM vs.  TM).  The present study examines these issues by investigating SM and TM listeners’ use of F0 and duration to encode English stress.  In doing so, and following recent studies investigating how L1 dialect affects the L2 perception of segments (e. g. , Chl´adkov´a & Podlipsk´y, 2011.  Colantoni, Steele, & Escudero, 2015.  Escudero, Simon, & Mitterer, 2012.  Escudero & Williams, 2012.  Mayr & Escudero, 2010), this study also sheds light on whether the L1 dialect can modulate L2 learners’ encoding of English stress.  Following previous research on the processing of stress (Dupoux et al. , 2001, 2008), this study uses sequence-recall experiments in which listeners listen to and encode sequences of words that differed in stress pattern.  Dupoux et al.  (2001) have proposed that the sequence-recall task provides a more robust method to study the processing of stress, because it requires listeners to encode stress in acoustically variable stimuli and discourages response strategies given the memory load it imposes on listeners.  In the task, participants ﬁrst learn to encode a stress distinction (e. g. , 'numi = 1.  nu'mi = 2).  then they hear sequences of nonwords that vary in stress pattern and must accurately encode the stress pattern of each nonsense word in the sequence (e. g. , 'numi, nu'mi, 'numi, nu'mi = 1212).  Sequence-recall tasks can thus assess whether nonnative listeners can encode acoustically variable word-level stress together with the segmental content of the words.  Our participants completed two such tasks.  The ﬁrst sequence-recall task contained naturally recorded English nonwords (Experiment 1), and the second sequence recall task contained resynthesized English nonwords (Experiment 2).  Experiment 1 served to establish a baseline in listeners’ processing of word-level stress when F0 and duration cues naturally co-occurred. 2 Experiment 2 examined how listeners use F0 and duration cues when these cues are isolated or pitted against each other. The two experiments took place consecutively, with a short break (approximately 5 min) in between.  Experiment 1 was conducted before Experiment 2 in order to establish baseline results with natural stimuli and because the former was easier (F0 and duration cues converged) than the latter (F0 and duration converged in only one of four conditions).  The same participants completed both Experiments 1 and 2.  Participants.  Thirty L2 learners of English who spoke either SM (n = 15) or TM (n = 15) as their L1 and 15 native English listeners participated in this study.  The English- and SM-speaking participants were undergraduate and graduate students who studied at a Midwestern American university.  Because it was difﬁcult to ﬁnd enough TMspeaking participants at the institution where the present research took place, 9 of the 15 TM-speaking learners were recruited and tested in Taiwan.  A questionnaire was used to collect biographical and language experience information about the participants.  This questionnaire revealed that the great majority of our SM-speaking and TM-speaking participants did not know other Chinese languages. 3 All of the SM-speaking participants and 8 of the 15 TM-speaking participants had spent at least 1 month in an English-speaking country.  No participant reported having any speech or hearing impairment.  A cloze (i. e. , ﬁll in the blank) test (Brown, 1980) was used to assess the L2 learners’ proﬁciency in English.  One advantage of using a written cloze test rather than an aural/oral proﬁciency test is that it avoids potentially circular argumentation by tapping into a set of language skills that are known to be highly predictive of general proﬁciency but that differ from the skills used in the present phonological processing experiment (e. g. , performance on an aural/oral comprehension experiment is likely to be inﬂuenced by listeners’ ability to perceive and produce English stress).  The particular cloze test that the L2 learners completed (Brown, 1980) was administered for a few years as part of the Guangzhou English Language Test at the Guangzhou English Language Center (Guangdong, China), and later as part of the English Language Institute Placement Test at the University of Hawai‘i (J.  D.  Brown, personal communication, April 28, 2007).  Because it has been the object of much research (for details, see Brown, 1980), the test is regarded as a valid and reliable measure of global English proﬁciency.  The maximum number of correct responses on the test was 50.  The L2 learners’ responses on the test were considered accurate so long as they were acceptable, as determined by a list of answers that were considered acceptable when the test was administered as part of the English Language Institute Placement Test at the University of Hawai‘i.  The participants’ biographical, language background, and proﬁciency information is provided in Table 1.  Analyses of the L2 learners’ cloze test scores and length of residence in English-speaking countries revealed a signiﬁcant positive correlation (r = . 472, n = 30, p < . 008), indicating that the L2 learners were more proﬁcient in English if they spent a longer amount of time in English-speaking countries.  Comparisons of the two groups of L2 learners revealed no signiﬁcant difference between them in their age of acquisition of English, t (28) = 1. 362, p > . 1, length of residence in English-speaking countries, t (19. 3) = –0. 255, p > . 1, or proﬁciency in English, t (21. 5) = 1. 464, p > . 1. 4 Despite this lack of difference, the fact that some of the TM listeners lived in Taiwan at the time of testing may raise concerns as to whether the TM listeners were as proﬁcient in English as the SM listeners.  To factor out possible proﬁciency effects in our results, we included L2 learners’ proﬁciency as a continuous variable in the statistical analyses. 5 Experiment 1.  Materials.  The stimuli were minimal pairs of English nonwords that differed in stress pattern (e. g. , ['fʌði] vs.  [fʌ'ði]).  The nonwords were created such that they would have a consonant–vowel (CV) C1V1C2V2 structure.  To ensure that the stress stimuli would not have vowel reduction cues to stress and still sound like English words, /ɪ/, /ʊ/, and /ʌ/ were used in V1 position and [i] was used in V2 position, because these sounds would not be reduced to schwas as a function of stress placement in English words.  To ensure that the consonants would similarly not provide segmental cues to stress, only fricatives and voiced stops were used in positions of C1 and C2 (e. g. , Cho & Keating, 2001.  Tremblay, 2009).  Twelve experimental nonwords were used (for a complete list, see Table A. 1 in AppendixThe experiment also included ﬁller stimuli that differed in their word-initial consonant (e. g. , [tɪvi] vs.  [kɪvi]) to prevent participants from developing stressspeciﬁc processing strategies.  The ﬁller stimuli always contrasted in the sounds /t/ and /k/, and they matched the stress contrast stimuli in their phonological structure, with /ɪ/, /ʊ/, and /ʌ/ being used in V1 position and [i] in V2 position.  To increase the phonetic variability in the stimuli, fricatives (/f/, /v/, /θ/, and /ð/), voiced stops (/b/, /d/, and /g/), or sonorants (/m/, /n/, and /l/) were used for the sound in C2 position.  A total of 12 nonwords were used for the ﬁllers (for a complete list, see Table A. 2 in Appendix A). 6 The inclusion of these ﬁller items in the experiment encouraged participants to attend to both suprasegmental and segmental information, and allowed us to rule out any effect of L1 dialect on their encoding of segmental words.  The nonwords were produced by a female native speaker of American English with a Midwestern accent.  She read each nonword four times in the carrier sentence “Say ___ again. ” Two tokens were selected from the four repetitions of each stress pattern.  The stimuli included a total of 96 tokens.  48 experimental tokens (12 nonwords × 2 stress patterns × 2 tokens) and 48 ﬁller tokens (12 nonwords × 2 segmental contrasts × 2 tokens).  Any given sequence (described in the next section) never contained the same token twice.  Acoustic measurements of the stress stimuli, provided in Table 2, revealed that the nonwords with initial and ﬁnal stress differed signiﬁcantly in the F0 and duration ratios of the ﬁrst syllable to the second syllable, F0.  t (23) = 17. 1, p < . 01.  duration.  t (23) = 5. 58, p < . 01.  It can be noted that both nonwords with initial stress and nonwords with ﬁnal stress have a shorter initial syllable than ﬁnal syllable due to word-ﬁnal lengthening.  The intensity of all the stimuli was normalized at 70 dB.  Procedures.  The task was conducted using Paradigm software (Perception Research Systems, 2007).  The experimental stimuli were heard together in the same block, and the ﬁller stimuli were heard together in a separate block.  The sequencerecall task had two main phases.  a familiarization (or association) phase and a testing phase.  In the familiarization phase, participants were trained to associate 1 and 2 (on a keyboard) with word-initial and word-ﬁnal stress (experimental stimuli) or with “t” and “k” (ﬁller stimuli).  This was done using real words (trusty vs.  trustee, table vs.  cable).  Participants received feedback on whether or not their responses were correct.  After 18 trials, an association test was conducted in which participants were required to correctly identify the stress pattern or initial consonant they heard (as 1 or 2).  The participants were invited to complete the testing phase only after receiving an accuracy score equal to or higher than 95% on the association test.  If the participants did not achieve 95% accuracy, they were required to take the familiarization task again, up to two more times.  Given the transparency of the familiarization phase, 40 of the 45 participants reached the accuracy criterion in their ﬁrst attempt, and the 5 participants who were required to take the task again reached the accuracy criterion within three attempts.  The training took 10–20 min depending on whether the participants reached the accuracy criterion on their ﬁrst attempt.  In the testing phase, participants were asked to recall sequences of four tokens by pressing 1 and 2 in the correct order.  For the experimental stimuli, each sequence included two tokens with word-initial stress and two tokens with word-ﬁnal stress (e. g. , [fʌ'ði] ['fʌði] ['fʌði] [fʌ'ði]).  For the ﬁller stimuli, each sequence included two tokens with word-initial /t/ and two tokens with word-initial /k/ (e. g. , [tɪvi] [kɪvi] [kɪvi] [tɪvi]).  Six different token orders (i. e. , [1122], [2211], [1212], [1221], [2121], [2112]) were used for the sequences of nonwords.  The six orders were used to counterbalance the number of nonwords with initial and ﬁnal stress or with initial /t/ and /k/ within a sequence.  Sequences with identical stress patterns or initial consonants (i. e. , [1111], [2222]) were not used because there was no change in the sequences.  thus, such trials might be much easier than other trials (Dupoux et al. , 2001).  Sequences with three identical stress patterns or initial consonants (i. e. , [1112], [1121], [1211], [2111], [1222], [2122], [2212], [2221]) were also not used to keep the task relatively short.  As will be shown in the Results section, despite the limited number of patterns to be recalled, listeners did not perform well on the task, indicating that the task was difﬁcult.  The order of sequences and of tokens within each sequence was randomized across participants.  The experiment included a total of 72 experimental trials (12 nonwords × 6 orders) and 72 ﬁller trials (12 nonwords × 6 orders).  The experimental and ﬁller trials were heard in different blocks.  At the beginning of each trial, participants saw the visual prompt “next trial. ” Then they heard the four nonwords, each separated by an interstimulus interval of 50 ms, as in previous research (e. g. , Dupoux et al. , 2001, 2008).  The last interstimulus interval in the sequence was followed by the auditory prompt “OK” in another female voice to prevent participants from using echoic memory to recall the sequences.  The intertrial interval was 1500 ms.  Participants completed a practice session of 12 sequences to ensure that they understood how to carry out the task before the actual experiment.  The experiment took 20–30 min to complete.  Data analysis and predictions.  Logit mixed-effects models were conducted on the participants’ sequence-encoding accuracy.  The models were ﬁtted in R using the lmer function from the lme4 package for mixed-effects models (for discussion, see Baayen, 2008).  The ﬁrst two analyses focused on participants’ accuracy with stimuli that differed in stress.  A ﬁrst model analyzed the sequence-encoding accuracy of the three groups, with L1 (English, SM, and TM.  baseline = English) as ﬁxed effect and with participant, test item, trial order, and sequence order (e. g. , [1122], [2211]) as crossed random effects.  A second model analyzed the sequence-encoding accuracy of only the L2 groups, with L1 dialect (SM and TM.  baseline = SM), L2 proﬁciency (centered cloze test scores, obtained by subtracting the cloze test mean [across participants] from the raw cloze test score, to reduce multicollinearity in the model), and their interaction as ﬁxed effects, and with participant, test item, trial order, and sequence order as crossed random effects.  The last two analyses were identical to the ﬁrst two, but they were instead performed on participants’ sequenceencoding accuracy on test items that differed in their initial consonant (i. e. , the ﬁller items).  For each analysis, ﬁxed effects were removed from the initial (i. e. , most complex) model one at a time, and model comparisons were run in pairwise fashion to determine if the more complex model accounted for signiﬁcantly more of the variance, as determined by log-likelihood ratio tests.  We report the simplest model that accounted for signiﬁcantly more of the variance than simpler models.  Whether TM listeners differ from SM listeners in their ability to process English stress in Experiment 1, where the F0 and duration cues coincide, depends on whether or not these cues are additive in the processing of English stress.  If they are, TM-speaking L2 learners of English should be less accurate than SMspeaking L2 learners of English at encoding English stress, because TM listeners are expected to be less reliant on duration as a cue to lexical identity as compared to SM listeners.  If, in contrast, cues to stress are not additive, and if TM listeners can transfer the use of F0 cues to word identity from the lexical tones in TM to word-level stress in English, then TM and SM listeners should perform similarly on the task, because F0 is the primary cue to lexical tones and thus signals lexical identity in both languages.  Results.  The accuracy of the participants’ sequence encoding for stimuli that differed in stress pattern is shown in Figure 1.  The best logit mixed-effects model on all the participants’ accuracy was a model that did not include any ﬁxed effect (i. e. , adding L1 to the model did not improve it).  This indicates that neither the SM group nor the TM group differed from the English group in their encoding of stress in English nonwords.  Similarly, the best logit mixed-effect models on the L2 learners’ accuracy did not include any ﬁxed effect (i. e. , adding L1 dialect and/or L2 proﬁciency to the model did not improve it).  This indicates that SM and TM listeners did not differ from each other in their processing of stress, and L2 proﬁciency (as measured by the cloze test) did not inﬂuence their performance on the task.  Hence, all three groups patterned similarly in the processing stress in English nonwords. 7 The accuracy of the participants’ sequence encoding for stimuli that differed in their initial consonant is shown in Figure 2.  The best logit mixed-effects model on all the participants’ accuracy included L1 as ﬁxed effect.  This model is summarized in Table 3.  The results of this analysis suggests that the English group outperformed the SM and TM groups in their encoding of /t/ and /k/ in English nonwords.  However, the best logit mixed-effect model on the L2 learners’ accuracy did not include any effect, indicating that SM and TM listeners did not differ from each other in their processing of /t/ and /k/ in English nonwords.  Discussion.  The results revealed no signiﬁcant difference in performance between any of the groups in their encoding of stress in English nonwords.  This indicates that the TM-speaking L2 learners of English encoded English stress as well as did native English listeners and SM-speaking L2 learners of English, both of whom have word-level stress in their L1.  The results also showed that the SM and TM listeners did not differ from each other but performed less accurately than English listeners when encoding word-initial /t/ and /k/.  The lower segmental accuracy of the L2 groups as compared to native English listeners may be due to differences between English and Mandarin in their phonetic realizations of the target segments (e. g. , English /t/ is alveolar whereas Mandarin /t/ is dental) and possibly in their phonotactics (e. g. , the lax vowels following /t/ and /k/ in the stimuli are not permitted in Mandarin).  The lack of signiﬁcant difference between TM listeners and SM (and English) listeners in the experimental condition indicates that TM listeners were not at a disadvantage as compared to SM listeners when processing English stress.  If TM listeners are less reliant on duration cues to lexical identity than SM listeners, as we predicted from the weighting of suprasegmental cues in their L1, then these results might suggest that the F0 cues were sufﬁcient for TM listeners to be able to process English stress.  Listeners’ independent use of F0 and duration cannot, however, be assessed without isolating these cues in experimental stimuli.  Experiment 2 used resynthesized stimuli in which F0 and duration were manipulated in order to determine whether TM and SM listeners differ from each other in their use of F0 and duration cues to English stress.  Experiment 2.  Materials.  As in Experiment 1, the experimental stimuli were minimal pairs of English nonwords that differed only in suprasegmental cues to stress (e. g. , ['fʌði] vs.  [fʌ'ði]).  Because voiced stops and fricatives might behave differently in cueing stress, only nonwords containing fricative consonants were used in Experiment 2 to control for the cues provided by the initial consonant.  Four nonwords (/sɪvi/, /zʊθi/, /fʌði/, and /hʌﬁ/) were selected for resynthesis from the nonwords used in Experiment 1.  The experimental stimuli included a total of 16 tokens (4 segmental nonwords× 2 stress patterns× 2 repetitions).  As in Experiment 1, four nonwords differing in their word-initial consonant (e. g. , [tɪvi] vs.  [kɪvi]) were also selected from Experiment 1 as ﬁllers to prevent participants from developing stress-speciﬁc processing strategies.  The ﬁller stimuli included a total of 16 tokens (4 segmental nonword pairs × 2 initial consonants × 2 repetitions).  Any given sequence (described in the next section) never contained the same token twice.  As shown in Table 4, the experimental nonwords with initial and ﬁnal stress differed signiﬁcantly in the F0 and duration ratios of the ﬁrst syllable to the second syllable, F0.  t (7) = 24. 6, p < . 01.  duration.  t (7) = 7. 01, p < . 01.  The values in Table 4 are similar to those presented in Table 2, but slightly different in that only a subset of the nonwords were included in Experiment 2.  The resynthesis of the experimental stimuli was done based on the average values reported in Table 4.  The experimental stimuli were resynthesized such that stress would be conveyed by both F0 and duration (“F0 + duration cues” condition), by F0 alone (“F0 cue” condition), by duration alone (“duration cue” condition), or by conﬂicting F0 and duration (“conﬂicting cues” condition).  The F0 + duration cues condition serves as the baseline, in that it contains two suprasegmental cues that signal stress in English nonwords.  The F0 cue condition and the duration cue condition serve as experimental conditions, with the understanding that their comparison to the F0 + duration cues condition reﬂects the degree to which performance becomes more impaired upon the removal of, respectively, duration cue or F0 cue.  Finally, in the conﬂicting cues condition, the F0 and duration cues contradict each other, such that a syllable with higher F0 is shorter and a syllable with lower F0 is longer.  This last condition makes it possible to determine whether listeners weigh one cue more than the other when encoding stress patterns.  Thus, the conﬂicting cues condition speciﬁes the relative importance of F0 and duration cues in listeners’ encoding of English stress.  Recall that all the stimuli had ﬁrst been normalized for intensity at 70 dB.  The F0 and duration cues were then manipulated with PSOLA in Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2012) such that the nonwords had the average F0 and/or duration of the natural stimuli reported in Table 4.  Thus, in the condition where F0 was the only cue to stress, the duration of each syllable corresponded to the average duration across both syllables and stress patterns (i. e. , 249 ms) in Table 4. 8 In the condition where duration was the only cue to stress, the F0 of each syllable corresponded to the average F0 across both syllables and stress patterns (i. e. , 189 Hz) in Table 4.  In the condition where both F0 and duration converged, the resynthesized stimuli had the exact values reported in Table 4.  In the condition where F0 and duration conﬂicted, F0 and duration measurements were swapped across stress patterns such that the stimuli could be considered as having initial or ﬁnal stress depending on whether listeners attended to F0 or duration.  Procedures.  The sequence-recall task in Experiment 2 had only a testing phase, as the participants completed the familiarization (or association) test in Experiment 1 and completed Experiment 2 approximately 5 min after Experiment 1.  In the testing phase, participants were asked to recall sequences of four tokens by pressing 1 and 2 in the correct order.  Each test trial began with the auditory presentation of a sequence that included two stress-initial tokens and two stress-ﬁnal tokens with the same segments (e. g. , [fʌ'ði] ['fʌði] ['fʌði] [fʌ'ði]) or two /t/-initial and two /k/-ﬁnal tokens (e. g. , [tɪvi] [kɪvi] [kɪvi] [tɪvi]).  For the experimental stimuli, each sequence consisted of four different tokens from the same cue condition (F0 + duration cues, F0 cue, duration cue, or conﬂicting cues).  To shorten the duration of the experiment, for both experimental and ﬁller stimuli, three of the six possible sequences (i. e. , [1122], [2211], [1212], [1221], [2121], [2112]) were used for two nonwords, and the other three possibilities were used for the other two nonwords.  The order of sequences and of tokens within each sequence was randomized across participants.  The experiment included 48 experimental sequences (4 segmental nonwords×4 conditions×3 orders) and 48 ﬁller sequences (4 segmental nonword pairs×4 repetitions×3 orders).  The experimental and ﬁller trials were presented in different blocks.  The rest of the procedures were identical to those of Experiment 1.  The experiment took 20–25 min to complete.  Data analysis and predictions.  The ﬁrst two analyses focused on participants’ accuracy with stimuli that differed in stress.  Logit mixed-effects models were conducted on the participants’ sequence-encoding accuracy in the ﬁrst three experimental conditions.  A ﬁrst model analyzed the accuracy of the three groups, with cue condition (F0 + duration cues, F0 cue, and duration cue.  baseline = F0 + duration cues), L1 (English, SM, and TM.  baseline = English), and the interaction between the two as ﬁxed effects and with participant, test item, trial order, and sequence order (e. g. , [1122], [2211], etc. ) as crossed random effects.  A second model analyzed only the L2 learners’ accuracy, with cue condition (F0 + duration cues, F0 cue, and duration cue.  baseline = F0 + duration cues), L1 dialect (SM and TM.  baseline = SM), proﬁciency (centered cloze-test scores, as obtained for Experiment 1), and all interactions as ﬁxed effects, and with participant, test item, trial order, and sequence order as crossed random effects.  The results in the conﬂicting cues condition were analyzed separately because they did not yield the same dependent variable as the previous three conditions.  In this condition, because F0 and duration cues conﬂicted, the stress pattern of each word in the sequence could not be unequivocally identiﬁed.  Participants’ responses were therefore coded based on the use of F0 or duration cues to identify the stress patterns.  For the use of F0, the recalled stress patterns were deemed to be “accurate” if the word for which the initial syllable had a higher F0 was identiﬁed as 1 and if the word for which the ﬁnal syllable had a higher F0 was identiﬁed as 2.  For the use of duration, the recalled stress patterns were deemed to be “accurate” if the word with a longer initial syllable was identiﬁed as 1 and if the word with a longer ﬁnal syllable was identiﬁed as 2.  The sequence “accuracy” computed on the basis of these two different coding thus reﬂect listeners’ consistent use of F0 versus duration cues to English stress when these two cues are pitted against eachLogit mixed-effects models were conducted on the participants’ accuracy in the conﬂicting cues condition.  A ﬁrst model analyzed all participants’ accuracy in their use of F0, with L1 (English, SM, and TM.  baseline = English) as ﬁxed effect, and with participant, test item, trial order, and sequence order as crossed random effects.  A second model analyzed L2 learners’ accuracy in their use of F0, with L1 dialect (SM and TM.
