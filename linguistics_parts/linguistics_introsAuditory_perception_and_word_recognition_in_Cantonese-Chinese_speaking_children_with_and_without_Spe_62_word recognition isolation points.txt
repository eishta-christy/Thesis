I N T R O D U C T I O N.  Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) fail to develop expressive and/or receptive oral language at the same rate and/or to the same extent as typically developing children, despite adequate intelligence, peripheral sensory functioning, exposure to language, and no neurological, emotional, or social dysfunction (Bishop, .  Leonard, .  Rice, ).  Compared to same-age peers, these children demonstrate an uneven profile of abilities across domains of language, with most experiencing difficulties in grammatical morphology and syntax, but many also demonstrating difficulties in lexical and pragmatic skills (Leonard, ).  Difficulty in lexical processes underlying spoken word recognition is well documented in SLI.  inefficiency or inaccuracy in establishing, accessing, selecting, and retrieving from stored representations of spoken language (Dollaghan, ).  For example, children with SLI tend to have smaller overall expressive/receptive vocabulary (Hick, Botting & Conti-Ramsden, ) and impaired phonological processing (Briscoe, Bishop & Norbury, ), use fewer different words per utterance (Rice, Redmond & Hoffman, .  Wong, Klee, Stokes, Fletcher & Leonard, b), and are less accurate in nonword repetition (Estes, Evans & Else-Quest, ).  Multiple accounts have been proposed to explain the different language deficits observed in children with SLI, and much research has focused on the grammatical deficit account and the processing deficit account (Joanisse & Seidenberg, .  Leonard, ).  Some researchers have also explored the possibility of deficits in specific mechanisms such as lower-level auditory perception (Corriveau, Pasquini & Goswami, .  McArthur & Bishop, a, b.  Tallal & Piercy, ), but little research to date has focused on auditory perception and word recognition deficits within the same children with SLI (but see Montgomery, ).  The present study responded to this research gap by focusing on lexical access for spoken word recognition in SLI, and whether and how it might be related to auditory perception.  Spoken word recognition and the speech-gating task.  Spoken word recognition occurs when auditory perceptual input activates a single lexical phonological representation.  Activation begins upon receipt of auditory input and is updated as the input unfolds.  The activation seems to be graded according to word- and cohort-related factors, and multiple words can be activated in parallel and actively compete until a single match is selected (McMurray, Samelson, Lee & Tomblin, ).  Word recognition can thus be conceptualized as selective elimination from an activated cohort of potential targets until the ‘isolation point’ – the point within the word for which no other word matches are possible (Marslen-Wilson, ).  Spoken word recognition may be facilitated by developmental restructuring of phonological representations.  That is, ongoing reorganization of the lexicon such that representations are stored for accuracy and expediency (e. g.  Metsala & Walley, .  Walley, Metsala & Garlock, ).  with development, primarily between ages one to eight (Fowler, ), words with overlapping phonological properties are stored more systematically for better differentiation.  Word frequency and neighborhood density (i. e.  the number of acoustically similar words) have been posited to drive lexical restructuring.  High- rather than low-frequency words should have better-developed representations because the former are activated more often.  Words from high-density phonological neighborhoods should be under relatively strong pressure to differentiate from other lexical entries to enable recognition (Charles-Luce & Luce, .  Garlock, Walley & Metsala, ).  Lexical restructuring has been observed across alphabetic languages (Ziegler & Goswami, ) – which map morphemes onto phonemes or phoneme strings – as well as a logographic language that maps morphemes consistently onto syllables (i. e.  Chinese.  Kidd, Shum, Ho & Au, ).  Speech-gating, a behavioral task that estimates the point within spoken words beyond which correct recognition is possible (Allopenna, Magnuson & Tanenhaus, .  Grosjean, ), has been used productively and widely to study spoken word recognition and lexical development models.  In a typical non-contextual forward speech-gating task, spoken words are presented from their onset in segments (or ‘gates’) typically  ms in length, with word identification attempted after hearing each gate.  On each trial, an additional gate is added, with trials only ending when each word has been heard in its entirety.  The accumulated time increment at which recognition occurs without subsequent change of mind (the ‘acceptance point’) is thought to reflect the temporal window over which word recognition occurs.  This temporal window has been suggested to directly reflect the underlying organization of the representation.  well-established structure facilitates expedient word recognition because the cohort of incorrect matches can be rapidly discounted, and less-established representations impede word recognition because the cohort remains protractedly active (Metsala, ).  Thus the speech-gating task has been used to quantify the underlying structure of the phonological representations supporting spoken word recognition.  Consistent with this, Metsala observed that time taken to correctly identify gated words decreased with age, and that word frequency and neighborhood density effects were predicted by lexical restructuring.  These findings have been replicated in other gating studies (Griffiths & Snowling, .  Kidd et al. , .  Metsala, Stavrinos & Walley, ).  Speech-gating in SLI.  Speech-gating has been used for assessing spoken word recognition in SLI.  Dollaghan () compared SLI children with typically developing age-matched controls on their recognition of gated familiar and unfamiliar words.  There were no group differences for familiar words, but children with SLI needed to hear more of the unfamiliar words to recognize them than did the controls.  These findings did not support a task-related impairment.  Instead, the deficit seemed specific to the phonological representations of unfamiliar words and the ability to distinguish them from the better-established representations of familiar words.  Accessing less-established representations probably increases processing demands, leaving word recognition vulnerable.  Children with SLI were also less likely to produce the correct initial consonant at the earliest gate for all word types, suggesting lower-level auditory perceptual deficits that impede the initial acoustic-phonetic analysis (Dollaghan, ).  Montgomery () used speech-gating of highly familiar words to examine whether children with SLI were impaired in ‘lexical mapping’ (i. e.  lexical access and lexical activation) – the stage when auditory perceptual input undergoes acoustic-phonetic analysis.  No group differences were found between children with SLI and their typically developing peers matched on either age or vocabulary, arguing against word recognition and low-level auditory perceptual deficits in SLI (Sutherland & Gillon, ).  Mainela-Arnold, Evans, and Coady () likewise observed neither group difference in spoken word recognition isolation points between SLI children and age-matched controls, nor any interaction between SLI status, word frequency, and neighborhood density.  However, children with SLI vacillated more between the target and incorrect cohort items after the isolation point, suggesting that word recognition in SLI is more vulnerable to interference from competing activated representations.
