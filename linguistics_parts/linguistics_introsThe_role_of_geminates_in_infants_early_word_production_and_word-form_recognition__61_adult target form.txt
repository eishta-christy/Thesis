Introduction.  Children’s first word forms have been found to be very similar across languages, with minor ambient language effects (Boysson-Bardies & Vihman, .  Vihman, Kay, Boysson-Bardies, Durand & Sundberg, ).  This similarity in production can be ascribed to infants’ limited articulatory skills (Davis & MacNeilage, ) and experience (Vihman, ).  As children move into regular word production, however, cross-linguistic differences are observed (Stoel-Gammon, Williams & Buder, .  Buder & Stoel-Gammon, .  Vihman, , ).  One early-emerging difference, for example, is the production of long consonants or, where consonantal length plays a phonologically contrastive role, GEMINATES (which nevertheless need not be in any sense contrastive for the children).  Because child production is relatively slow or sluggish (Smith, .  Payne, Post, Astruc, Prieto & Vanrell, ), long medial consonants can readily be heard (and measured) in the first words, even in the case of children exposed only to languages like English or French, where they are not contrastive and in fact rarely occur at all (Vihman & Velleman, ).  To illustrate this, analysis of the word forms produced by five children each at the time of first word use (termed the -WORD POINT [wp].  the first -minute recording session in which at least four different spontaneously produced words can be identified.  mean age . · for the American and French infants, .  for the Finnish infants) revealed a mean consonant length for English of  ms (s. d.  ·), for French,  ms (s. d.  ·), and for Finnish, with its contrastive consonant length,  ms (s. d.  ) (Vihman & Velleman, ).  As the children gain production skills and productive lexical knowledge of their language, however, the duration of medial consonants drops significantly in languages with no phonological contrast in consonant length.  Thus, at the end of the single-word period (-WORD POINT [wp].  mean age .  for the American infants, .  for the French, .  for the Finnish), the mean medial-consonant duration for the same five children learning English was  ms and for those learning French,  ms, with a drop in variability within each group as well (s. d.  for English, ·, for French, ·).  at the same time, medial consonants became longer and intra-group variability increased for the five Finnish children (mean  ms, s. d.  ·).  In fact, in languages with geminates the use and overuse of these long consonants (i. e.  their production even for singleton targets) is consistently reported for the single-word period (see, for Arabic.  Khattab & Al-Tamimi, .  for Estonian.  Vihman, .  for Finnish.  Kunnari, .  Savinainen-Makkonen, a, b, , .  for Hindi.  Bhaya Nair, .  for Italian.  Keren-Portnoy, Majorano & Vihman, .  Majorano, Rainieri & Corsano .  and for Japanese.  Kunnari, Nakai & Vihman, .  Ota, ).  Finally, children learning Welsh, with its (phonetic) accentual lengthening of consonants, also make heavy use of long medial consonants in their early words (Vihman, Nakai & DePaolis, ), although no significant increase in mean medial consonant duration is seen in this case over the period of single word use (Vihman & Kunnari, ), presumably because long consonants are not lexically contrastive in Welsh.  That is, where consonant duration is a (non-contrastive) concomitant of the accentual pattern, its frequency of occurrence may be variable but should be consistently so over time and development.  Where it is lexically tied, infants’ increasing lexical knowledge results in a steady increase in representations of words with geminates.  Thus, contrastive child use, as seen in Finnish, appears to be mediated by lexical advance.  Examples of early words produced with long medial consonants in Arabic, Estonian, Finnish, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, and Welsh are presented in Table , where SELECTED (or more or less accurately produced words) have a long consonant in the adult target as well as in the child form, whereas ADAPTED words (modified to fit one of the child’s favored production patterns) display ‘overuse’ of geminates.  Here we observe that in their production of long consonants children may replace a VV sequence by CC (see both Martin’s word form for Arabic ba. ba and Kaia’s form for Estonian auto), omit the onset consonant (as in Joel’s word for Finnish loppu.  cf.  also the Hindi and Japanese examples), ‘demote’ an onset consonant (replacing a supraglottal by a glottal segment.  Fflur, Welsh example), or retain the length feature while changing the segmental quality (and word length) to fit a consonant-harmony constraint (as in Anna’s word for Italian cavallo).  Interestingly, in most of these languages child overuse of the prosodic word shape <VCCV> can be observed (as in the examples from Joel, V, Haruo, and Fflur.  Table ), even when the adult target form includes an early-learned onset consonant such as a labial or coronal stop and the word is accentually trochaic (strong–weak accent), so that the omitted initial consonant is part of the accented syllable.  In fact, Vihman and Velleman () report that % of the tokens produced by five Finnish children at the wp were of the shape <VCCV>.
