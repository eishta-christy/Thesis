The ﬁrst language (L1) is often claimed to be responsible for second language (L2) learners’ (in)ability to process particular sounds in the target language.  However, the conditions under which the L1 facilitates or inhibits the learning of new sounds are unclear, especially in the suprasegmental domain.  Theoretical models such as Flege’s (1995) speech learning model and Best’s (1995) perceptual assimilation model predict L2 learners’ performance based on the phonetic similarity between L1 and L2 sounds.  However, most of the evidence in support of these (and other) L2 speech perception models comes from studies that focus on consonants (e. g. , Best, McRoberts, & Goodell, 2001.  Best, McRoberts, & Sithole, 1988.  Flege & Hillenbrand, 1986.  Flege, Munro, & Mackay, 1995.  Flege, Takagi, & Mann, 1996) and vowels (e. g. , Flege, 1987.  Flege, Bohn, & Jang, 1997.  Flege, Munro, & Fox, 1994.  Fox, Flege, & Munro, 1995).  L2 learners’ processing of suprasegmental information has been the focus of less research, and it is therefore less well understood.  Studies have shown that whether suprasegmental cues contribute to distinguishing among words in the L1, and how they do so, inﬂuences L2 learners’ use of these cues in the L2 (for discussion, see Cutler, 2012).  Existing L2 studies on lexical tones have shown that how different aspects of fundamental frequency (F0.  e. g. , pitch direction and pitch height) signal lexical identity in the L1 largely determines how L2 learners perceive and process tones in the target language (e. g. , Francis, Ciocca, Ma, & Fenn, 2008.  Hall´e, Chang, & Best, 2004.  Leather, 1987.  Lee, Vakock, & Wurm.  1996.  Stagray & Downs, 1993.  Wang, Spence, Jongman, & Sereno, 1999.  Wayland & Guion, 2004).  By contrast, previous research on the perception and processing of stress has focused on the degree of similarity or difference between the L1 and L2 stress systems (i. e. , whether or not stress falls on the same syllable vs.  on different syllables across words.  Dupoux, Pallier, Sebasti´an, & Mehler, 1997.  Dupoux, Peperkamp, & Sebasti´an-Gall´es, 2001.  Dupoux, Sebasti´an-Gall´es, Navarrete, & Peperkamp, 2008.  Peperkamp & Dupoux, 2002.  Peperkamp, Vendelin, & Dupoux, 2010.  Tremblay, 2008, 2009), and not so much on the speciﬁc suprasegmental cues (e. g. , F0, duration, and intensity) that instantiate stress in the L1 versus the L2 (but see Cooper, Cutler, & Wales, 2002.  Lin, Wang, Idsardi, & Xu, 2014.  Ortega-Llebaria, Hong, & Fan, 2013.  Zhang & Francis, 2010).  Hence, it is unclear whether the L2 processing of word-level stress is determined by how suprasegmental cues contribute to lexical identity in the L1.  The present study sheds further light on this question by investigating L2 learners’ use of F0 and duration cues in the processing of word-level stress.  More speciﬁcally, this study examines whether a cue-weighting theory of speech perception (e. g. , Francis & Nusbaum, 2002.  Holt & Lotto, 2006.  Ingvalson, Holt, & McClelland, 2011.  Zhang & Francis, 2010) can explain L2 learners’ ability to process word-level stress.  It does so by comparing the processing of stress in L2 learners of English who speak Standard Mandarin (SM) or Taiwan Mandarin (TM) as L1 dialects and who are at a similar proﬁciency in English.  As will be shown below, SM, but not TM, instantiates word-level stress with the use of duration.  This study investigates whether native SM and native TM listeners who have learned English as L2 differ in their ability to use duration as a cue to stress.  An additional contribution of this study is that it investigates the effect of the L1 dialect on L2 learners’ use of suprasegmental cues to stress.  L2 PERCEPTION AND PROCESSING OF WORD-LEVEL STRESS.  Stress is lexically contrastive in languages such as English, Dutch, and Spanish.  For instance, in English, record (noun) and record (verb) form a minimal pair with respect to stress placement.  By contrast, languages such as French or Finnish do not have word-level stress.  To illustrate, in French, the ﬁnal syllable of the last word in a phrase is accented, with this accent functioning as a boundary marker for words or phrases (e. g. , Jun & Fougeron, 2000, 2002.  Vaissi`ere, 1991.  Welby, 2006) but not distinguishing among segmentally identical words.  Languages thus differ in whether or not stress contributes to lexical identity.  Native speakers of languages that have contrastive stress have little difﬁculty encoding stress in L2 words or in nonwords.  Using four cross-modal priming experiments and two forced-choice identiﬁcation experiments, Cooper et al.  (2002) showed that Dutch-speaking L2 learners of English, who use stress to recognize Dutch words, were quite successful at using the suprasegmental cues of English stress to recognize English words.  Similarly, Dupoux and colleagues have shown that native Spanish listeners are successful in distinguishing and recalling nonwords that differ in stress (Dupoux et al. , 2001, 2008.  Peperkamp et al. , 2010).  In contrast, native speakers of languages that do not have contrastive stress have difﬁculty processing word-level stress.  Using a sequence-recall task, Dupoux and colleagues showed that native French-speaking listeners, but not native Spanishspeaking listeners, had difﬁculty encoding stress when listening to nonwords (Dupoux et al. , 2001.  Peperkamp & Dupoux, 2002).  To explain these ﬁndings, they proposed that listeners’ (in)ability to distinguish stress contrast is determined by whether, within the ﬁrst 2 years of life, they set the stress parameter to encode stress in their phonological representation of lexical words (Peperkamp, 2004.  Peperkamp & Dupoux, 2002).  For languages without contrastive stress (e. g. , French), infants are predicted to observe stress regularity across words and thus not encode stress in their mental lexicon, which was considered the cause of their so-called stress deafness.  This stress deafness was observed not only in native French-speaking listeners but also in proﬁcient French-speaking L2 learners of Spanish (Dupoux et al. , 2008) and in simultaneous French–Spanish bilinguals who were French dominant (Dupoux, Peperkamp, & Sebasti´an-Gall´es, 2010).  This suggests that for L2 learners who do not have contrastive stress in their dominant language, the difﬁculty in processing word-level stress is very robust.  Recent studies indicate that the mechanism underlying stress processing may not operate in an all or none fashion.  Subtle differences between L1 and L2 prosodic systems can also inﬂuence L2 learners’ processing of stress (e. g. , Tremblay, 2008, 2009).  For instance, Tremblay (2008) found that not all French-speaking L2 learners were “stress-deaf”.  in her study, several French Canadian L2 learners of English were able to use the stress contrast to distinguish between competing L2 word candidates.  One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the ﬁndings of Tremblay and those of Dupoux and colleagues, in addition to methodological differences between the two sets of studies, is that speakers of Canadian French may have less difﬁculty than speakers of European French in using stress contrast for L2 lexical access because of the greater contrast between strong and weak syllables in Canadian French as compared to European French (for a discussion, see Tremblay, 2008, 2009).  Another possible explanation is that speakers of Canadian French may have less difﬁculty using stress contrast for L2 lexical access because the speciﬁc suprasegmental cues that signal English stress (e. g. , F0, duration, and intensity) may be used more in Canadian French than in European French.  In the realm of L2 speech perception, empirical research has demonstrated that surface phonetic details can play an important role in determining the difﬁculties that L2 learners may experience in L2 speech perception.  The cue-weighting theory of speech perception (e. g. , Francis et al. , 2008.  Francis & Nusbaum, 2002.  Gandour, 1983.  Holt & Lotto, 2006.  Ingvalson et al. , 2011.  Zhang & Francis, 2010) highlights the importance of these phonetic details, as it is concerned with how acoustic cues that signal a speciﬁc contrast are weighed in different languages and how differences in this weighting affect L2 speech perception and processing.  According to this theory, speech perception is multidimensional, and acoustic cues are weighed differently across categories and across languages.  Although multiple cues are simultaneously available to listeners, these cues are not weighed equally, and they often have “trading relations” (e. g. , Repp, 1982), with increased sensitivity to one cue being accompanied by decreased sensitivity to another cue.  Listeners from different language backgrounds tune in to different acoustic cues in the same stimuli depending on how these cues are used to signal a contrast inA clear example of the relevance of cue weighting exists for the perception of /l/ and /ɹ/ by Japanese L2 learners of English, as illustrated in Iverson, Kuhl, AkahaneYamada, Diesch, Tohkura, Kettermann, and Siebert (2003).  Prior studies had found that Japanese listeners had great difﬁculty distinguishing between English /l/ and /ɹ/ (Bradlow, Pisoni, Yamada, & Tohkura, 1997.  Lively, Logan, & Pisoni, 1993.  Logan, Lively, & Pisoni, 1991.  Yamada, 1995).  In their comparison of native English listeners and Japanese- and German-speaking L2 learners of English, Iverson et al.  (2003) showed that English listeners discriminated the native /l/–/ɹ/ contrast using the third formant (F3).  In contrast, Japanese listeners were more sensitive to the second formant (F2) than to F3, probably because the Japanese liquid is perceptually more similar to English /l/, which is often cued by a low F2, than to English /ɹ/, which is often cued by a low F3 (e. g. , Aoyama, Flege, Guion, Yamada, & Akahane-Yamada, 2004).  Because Japanese listeners did not pay sufﬁcient attention to F3, they found it difﬁcult to perceive the English contrast.  Although German /ʁ/ differs from English /ɹ/, German listeners, unlike Japanese listeners, were able to distinguish English /l/ and /ɹ/ because of their sensitivity to F3.  Japanese listeners’ perceptual difﬁculty was attributed to their sensitivity to unhelpful F2 information, whereas German listeners’ perceptual sensitivity was attributed to their sufﬁcient attention to F3, a critical cue for distinguishing English /l/ and /ɹ/ (for a model that similarly predicts L2 learners’ perception of L2 categories on the basis of the mapping between L1 phonetic cues and the corresponding L1 categories, see Escudero, 2005, 2009.  Escudero & Boersma,Like segments, multiple suprasegmental cues (i. e. , F0, duration, and intensity) contribute to the realization of word-level stress (e. g. , Beckman, 1986.  Fry, 1955.  Lieberman, 1961) and more generally to lexical identity (e. g. , in lexical tones.  Chao, 1968.  Duanmu, 2007).  Moreover, languages with word-level stress differ in the extent to which suprasegmental cues contribute relevant information for lexical access.  For instance, native English listeners have been shown to make limited use of suprasegmental cues to stress, as English stress is also signaled by segmental information (full vs.  reduced vowels).  as a result, English listeners’ word recognition is not inhibited by errors in stress placement unless these errors result in segmental (i. e. , vowel quality) changes in the word (Braun, Lemh¨ofer, & Mani, 2011.  Cutler, 1986.  Cutler & Clifton, 1984.  Cutler, Wales, Cooper, & Janssen, 2007.  Fear, Cutler, & Butterﬁeld, 1995.  Small, Simon, & Goldberg, 1988).  Likewise, native English listeners rely less on suprasegmental cues to English stress than do Dutch-speaking L2 learners of English, because vowel reduction is more frequent in English than in Dutch (Cooper et al. , 2002.  Cutler et al. , 2007).  This suggests that the language-speciﬁc weighting of cues to English stress affects how listeners from different language backgrounds process it.  <Middle> THE PRESENT STUDY.  The present study further investigates whether the L2 learners’ processing of stress is determined by the degree to which individual suprasegmental cues contribute to lexical identity in the L1.  It does so by focusing on an L1-L2 pairing that has been the object of relatively little research.  Mandarin-speaking L2 learners of English (but see Chrabaszcz, Win, Lin, & Idsardi, 2014.  Lin et al. , 2014.  Wang, 2008.  Zhang & Francis, 2010).  Suprasegmental cues have a greater functional load in Mandarin than in English, because Mandarin words with different lexical tones (signaled primarily by F0 cues) have different meanings (e. g. , [m¯a] “mother,” [m´a] “hemp,” [mˇa] “horse,” and [m`a] “scold”.  Chao, 1968.  Duanmu, 2007)1 .  although English has word-level stress, it has few words that can be distinguished only in the suprasegmental cues to stress (e. g. , trusty vs.  trustee.  Cutler, 1986.  Cutler & Clifton, 1984).  Two target Mandarin varieties, SM and TM, are the focus of the present study.  SM is based on the Beijing dialect (i. e. , Putonghua) and spoken by the people of Mainland China, whereas TM is spoken by the people of Taiwan and, thus, inﬂuenced by Taiwanese (i. e. , Southern Min).  Because SM and TM share the above tonal system, they both use F0 as the primary suprasegmental cue to lexical identity (e. g. , Howie, 1976.  Liu & Samuel, 2004).  Although duration is a secondary cue to lexical tones in Mandarin, it is much less reliable than F0 to signal word identity, because the duration of the tone is affected by its position in the word and in the sentence (e. g.
