1.  INTRODUCTION.  LIVING-IN-DIVERSITY, BEYOND THE RAINBOW.  In the early 1990s, anti-apartheid stalwart Desmond Tutu coined the metaphor of ‘the rainbow nation’ to describe the ‘miracle’ of South African democracy and the diversity of its people.  The image of the rainbow also evoked, probably unintentionally, a well-known Euro-American symbol of LGBT+ identity and pride.  the rainbow ﬂag.  And indeed, it was the complex intersection of these two global discourses – multiculturalism and LGBT+ rights – that positioned South Africa, a country at the southern-most tip of Africa, as a model of how to engage with diversity (Munro 2012).  The constitutional recognition of LGBT+ rights was a milestone in this process.  In 1994, South Africa became the ﬁrst nation to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in its constitution.  This opened the way for a wide range of legal challenges, culminating in the legalization of same-sex marriages in 2006.  However, legal provisions and rights are one thing, the realities of living-in-diversity are quite another.  Today, the image of the rainbow nation is heavily contested.  socio-economic inequalities, racism, and white supremacy are persistent.  and various forms of violence – systemic violence as imbedded in institutions, but also physical violence, especially towards women and sexual minorities – are deeply disturbing aspects of everyday life.  It is in this larger political context that we look at black queer visibilities and philosophies of hospitality.  While previous work on this topic has focused on metropolitan contexts (Matebeni 2011.  Livermon 2014), our ﬁeldwork took place in a non-metropolitan space.  a small town in the largely rural Eastern Cape province, about 500 kilometres from the next metropolitan centre.  We have argued previously that it is essential to pay attention to places beyond ‘the city’ – a privileged space in the sociolinguistic imagination – if our aim is to address existing ‘imbalances and marginalization’ in representation and theorization (Milani and Lazar, introduction to this Special Issue.  see also Deumert and Mabandla 2016).  In addition to moving the gaze from the city to a non-metropolitan space, we also explore the question of how to formulate ‘southern’ or ‘decolonial’ theories of diversity and hospitality.  We draw, broadly, on the work of Latin-American scholars such as Walter Mignolo (2000) and Ramon Grosfoguel (2011) who have argued for an approach they call ‘critical border thinking’.  This approach moves beyond Southern and Northern fundamentalisms in developing a dialogical perspective that challenges the monologic universalism of Northern theory, and provincializes (Chakrabarty 2000) such knowledge through a sustained dialogue with Southern epistemologies (also Sousa Santos 2014).  The article is structured as follows.  in section 2, we discuss what we call ‘the politics of inclusivity’, one of the core political strategies of the South African liberation movement.  We reflect on the ways in which diverse sexualities have been contested, and accepted, in South Africa (and Africa more broadly), and how a politics of inclusivity allowed diverse knowledges and ways-of-being to become visible.  Section 3 introduces the rural town of Forestville (a pseudonym).  Section 4 provides a discussion of the theoretical lens through which we look at the visibility of diversity.  hospitality.  It is in this section that we engage quite explicitly with the idea of ‘critical border thinking’.  we bring everyday knowledges of hospitality (as expressed in proverbs, talk and language), into conversation with academic philosophy (especially the work of Jacques Derrida).  Section 5 further explores, on the basis of interview data, the role of curiosity in hospitality.  curiosity has the potential for engagement, for dialogue and knowledge creation, but can also create – in the form of gossip – in-hospitality and thus violence.  Section 6 turns to the possibility of acceptance without judgement (a local discourse of ‘live and let live’), as well as the persistence of discrimination.  In the conclusion, we argue that – despite ambivalences and tensions – these diverse non-metropolitan discourses can help us in theorizing the idea of hospitality – moving it away from a somewhat repressive sense of duty and obligation (as evident in academic philosophy) to an affect-driven, lived and everyday praxis.  A note on terminology.  in an essay titled How Not to write about Queer in South Africa, Zethu Matebeni (2014) reminds us about the difficulties of naming.  Identities, sexual or otherwise, are inherently diverse and fragmented, shaped by silences as well as stereotypes that are perpetuated in both popular and academic writing.  Reflecting on names and naming is thus essential.  Also addressing the question of terminology, Thabo Msibi (2013) has argued that the global terms gay/lesbian – as well as the abbreviation LGBT+ – do not necessarily capture local realities.  At the same time, however, these global terms have been appropriated locally and are being re-shaped through discourse (Livermon 2012).  In our discussion we generally use the terms that are employed by those we spoke to.  however, we also use ‘queer’ as an analytic category, referring not to any defined or labelled sexuality, but to ‘a critical space that pushes the boundaries of what is embraced as normative’ (Matebeni and Pereira 2014.  7).  As a general placeholder we use the acronym LGBT+, indexing the open-ended diversity of sexualities through the [+] symbol. 2 <Middle> 2.  THE POLITICS OF INCLUSIVITY, LGBT+ RIGHTS AND PUBLIC ATTITUDES.  Andrew Masondo, national commissar of the African National Congress (henceforth ANC) in exile, referred to the liberation movement as a ‘big bus’.  The metaphor of the ‘big bus’ emphasized the fact that in the struggle against apartheid, people had to come together.  they had to accommodate their differences and form a diverse but united front.  In other words, it was imperative to create a broad sense of inclusiveness and belonging, and to be hospitable to diverse perspectives.  This had important political consequences.  The ANC, originally a middle-class male organization, embraced progressive politics from early on.  women’s rights and worker’s rights were an integral part of its politics from the 1950s, and – since the late 1980s – LGBT+ rights.  The latter were put on the agenda by vocal LGBT+ activists within the liberation movement.  Simon Nkoli, Beverly Ditsie and Alfred Machela.  However, inclusivity can be contested and there were concerns in the early 1990s that the progressive stance of the organization’s leadership – many of whom had encountered LGBT+ politics during exile in Europe or America – was perhaps not widely shared by the rank-and-file.  This view was expressed by Cheryl Carolus, then ANC Deputy Secretary General, at the launch of the National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality in 1995.  One must accept that the ANC is made up of very ordinary South Africans who bring with them many of the misinformed views, perspectives and prejudices that exist in society as a whole.  Those of us that support the equality clause need to make cognizance of this [fact that] our views as the leadership are not necessarily the one’s stated by the membership.  (cited in Dunton and Palmberg 1996.  47) In this article we wish to unsettle the leadership/membership dichotomy and argue that ‘very ordinary South Africans’ should not be seen as misinformed and prejudiced, struggling to embrace difference-of-being when it comes to issues of sexuality.  We argue that everyday knowledges about diversities (sexual and otherwise) should not be seen as conservative and backward, but can be at the vanguard not only of theory-making, but also of progressive politics.  It is not only ‘ordinary South Africans’ who have been portrayed as prejudiced, but also Africa as a whole.  International media, especially, have created a ‘simplistic opposition between homophobic Africa and a tolerant .  .  .  West’ (Awondo, Geschiere and Reid 2012.  149).  Similar discourses shape, at times, also scholarly engagement.  For example, in a recent review article Pierre de Vos (2015.  40) argues that the constitutional anti-discrimination clause did not help in changing ‘entrenched negative attitudes towards sexual minorities’ among ‘the majority of South African citizens’.  Discussions such as these are ultimately rooted in views of Africa (and Africans) as backward, in need of Northern modernity, education and development.  Yet statistics, such as the World Values Survey (see Adamczyk, Kim and Paradis 2015), suggest that attitudes did change over time, influenced not only by constitutional provisions but also by popular culture, with LGBT+ characters featuring in TV dramas, and celebrities openly declaring their sexualities.  Today, South Africans accept same-sex relations at rates that are not much different from those for the United States (Table 1).  While statistical data need to be interpreted with many pinches of salt – acknowledging bias in sample selection and wording of questions – they allow us to see broad changes in attitudinal patterns, and to understand that the South is just as dynamic as the North.  There is some indication that it is the urban, Christian middle classes, deeply shaped by the history of colonialism and persistent coloniality, who struggle most with their own prejudices.  The homophobia – as well as racism and xenophobia – of this group is one of the themes in K.  Sello Duiker’s (2001) novel The Quiet Violence of Dreams.  The novel’s black protagonist, Tshepo, challenges the idea that same-sex desire is ‘unAfrican’ and locates negative attitudes instead in (sub)urban middle-class milieus.  I mean, people always say that black culture is rigid and doesn’t accept things like homosexuals and lesbians.  You know the argument – it’s very unAfrican.  It’s a lot of crap.  In my experience that kind of thinking comes from urbanised blacks, people who’ve watered down the real origins of our culture and mixed it with Anglo-Saxon notions of the Bible.  It’s stupid to even suggest that homosexuality and lesbianism are foreign to black culture.  Long ago, long before whites, people were aware of blurs.  (cited in Hoad 2007.  105) The idea that pre-colonial Africa was quite different from contemporary urban milieus is supported in Marc Eppbrecht’s (2013 [2004]) monograph, Hungochani, as well as in Sylvia Tamale’s (2011) anthology, African Sexualities.  These texts show the complexities and diversities of African sexualities, suggesting that heteronormativity and homophobia, rather than diversity of sexual expression, might be the true colonial import (see also Reid 2013.  and the seminal work by Amadiume 1987).  That homophobic sentiments might be especially common among those who are considered ‘educated’ is also supported by Thabo Msibi’s (2009, 2013) work, which suggests that prejudice against LGBT+ people might be especially rampant at universities.  Similarly, the 2010–2014 South African data in the (above mentioned) World Values Survey suggests that such prejudice is a function of class position (which is closely linked to educational attainment).  when asked whether one would feel comfortable living next to ‘homosexuals’, 38 percent of South Africans answered in the negative.  However, the percentage rises to 47 percent for those who self-identify as ‘upper class’.  Historical sociologists and anthropologists writing about South Africa’s colonial (and postcolonial) middle class have often commented on the great emphasis this group places on ‘respectability’ – that is, Victorian values of ‘temperance, sobriety and moral rectitude’ (Mkhize 2016.  149).  Sexual desires, especially those not resulting in procreation, are excluded from this social space, a space that was shaped to a significant degree by Christian missionaries, their religious and educational institutions and the postcolonial re-instantiations of these institutions (Chitando and van Klinken 2016).  Thus, in early 2016, Rev.  Mpho Tutu, an ordained Anglican priest and daughter of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, had to quit the ministry after she married her female partner.  The reason was pressure from the Anglican Church of South Africa, which does not recognise same-sex marriages.  Northern missionaries continue to spread conservative discourses about homosexuality on the continent.  For example, draconian anti-LGBT+ legislation in Uganda was supported not only by middle-class evangelical Ugandans, but also by American missionaries (Awondo, Geschiere and Reid3.  FORESTVILLE.  FIELDWORK IN A MARGINALIZED AND DIVIDED TOWN.  The article draws on fieldwork that forms part of a larger, long-term project, going back to 2012 when we first began working in the rural towns of the Eastern Cape province, South Africa.  The main focus of our work has been on international migration, especially migrant traders, and the globalization of the countryside (Deumert and Mabandla 2016).  More recently, we began to look at diversities more broadly, including sexualities.  Our work took place in two different modes.  (a) a long-term, single-researcher ethnography (Mabandla).  and (b) an intermittent collaborative ethnography (Deumert and Mabandla).  This article presents material from the collaborative ethnography.  all observations and interviews cited were conducted as a team.  An important aspect of our collaboration has been the fact that we have different bodies.  black-male and white-female.  These bodies allow us access to different spaces, and bring with them different perspectives and different modes of interaction.  In analysing the recorded interviews and conversations, we take inspiration from recent proposals by, for example, Crispin Thurlow (2016) and Tommaso Milani (2015) to ‘queer’ discourse studies.  Queer, as noted in section 1, indexes a perspective that is intentionally anti-normative and anti-hegemonic.  In particular, queer approaches to discourse analysis challenge conventional concerns with representation and signification, and focus on the ‘more-thanrepresentational’ aspects of social life (Lorimer 2005).  This includes materiality, corporeality and, especially, affect.  The latter echoes Raymond Williams’ (1977.  132) ‘structures of feeling’.  ‘meanings and values as they are actively lived and felt’, focusing on ‘impulse, restraint and tone .  .  .  [the] affective elements of consciousness and relationship’ within the historicity of present power relations (see also Sharma and Tygstryp 2015).  In our analysis, we are especially interested in the ways in which feeling/affect are articulated in discourse.  that is, the ways in which talking about diversity is an affective-discursive practice (Wetherell 2013).  The data on which we draw was elicited mainly through interviews.  In addition, we draw on our own observations and experiences.  Such an approach might appear ‘anecdotal’ to the more empirically-minded sociolinguist, yet anecdotalism has a logic of its own and is important in achieving phenomenological understanding (Simons 1978.  Gallop 2002).  Forestville is what we call a ‘rural town’.  it is small (with a population of about 8000) and surrounded by farmland, both commercial and subsistence.  Its demographics – following the classifications used in the South African census (2011) – are predominately African (93%), with a small Coloured and white population.  (In South Africa, the category Coloured refers to people who were seen to be of ‘mixed’ or ‘creole’ ancestry. ) Forestville is a multilingual space.  isiXhosa is the majority language, but English and Afrikaans are also commonly used.  Like many other rural towns in South Africa, Forestville is a busy commercial centre.  On any given day the streets are full, and people from the surrounding villages and smaller towns arrive to shop at the many stores run by migrants from China, India, Bangladesh, Senegal, Somalia and Pakistan.  Diversity is palpable when walking down the streets.  it is a mix of old and new, modern and traditional, global and local.  Yet Forestville also remains a deeply divided place, and the racially exclusive networks of the apartheid era continue to shape daily life.  It is also a marginalized place, and poverty is significantly higher than in metropolitan centres.  Table 2 provides summary statistics for the municipal region where Forestville is located as well as comparative statistics for the nearest metropolitan centre, eThekwini/Queer visibilities are affected by the overall marginalized status of the area.  there are no LGBT+ support organizations or advocacy groups, and no annual Pride marches.  As a rural town with a fairly small population, Forestville has only a few public places that are available for sociable interaction and these are sharply divided according to race.  Zodwa, one of the people we interviewed, described – somewhat tongue-in-cheek – two places that are welcoming to black residents.  ‘the [hair] parlour and the tavern’.  Historically, white spaces, on the other hand, are generally seen as unwelcoming to black residents.  The racial exclusivity of such spaces is communicated not through words, but through corporeality and affect.  Menzi, a young black man who identifies as gay (see below), experiences these places not as homophobic, but as anti-black.  ‘[there are] racial issues .  .  .  you gonna get those stares, you are allowed to go in, but you just feel the [unwelcoming] vibes’ (Menzi).  Following Sara Ahmed (2004), we argue that such forms of affect (feeling welcomed/unwelcomed) circulate socially and historically.  the ‘vibe’ described by Menzi, is not just a personal feeling, it reflects the historical experience of racism – of being interpellated and seen as nothing but black.  It is the opposite of hospitality, a notion we explore in the remainder of this paper.  4.  BEYOND TOLERANCE.  HOSPITALITY Difference – of sexuality, race, language, citizenship and so forth – can be silenced through symbolic practices and institutions, through the patterns of everyday sociability, or through physical violence.  Sometimes, this silencing is almost invisible.  when diversity is tolerated, but not actually welcomed.  that is, when ‘you are allowed to go in, but you just feel the vibes’.  Tolerance – as a practice and specific form of affect – allows difference to exist but only within certain parameters.  There is always a threshold to tolerance, and tolerance thus masks underlying power relations (Altman 1971).  To move beyond the conditional acceptance of difference is at the heart of the ethics of hospitality.  Among the philosophers who have written about hospitality is Jacques Derrida (e. g.  2000, 2005.  Borradori 2003).  Derrida’s work, commonly referred to as poststructuralist, has relevance for a special issue on ‘perspectives from the South’.  Derrida, his prominence in Northern post-structuralism notwithstanding, cannot be understood simply as a Northern, metropolitan philosopher.  Rather, he should be seen as a border-thinker (in the sense outlined in section 1).  His work was shaped by growing up in Algeria.  not as a French colonialist but as an Algerian Jew and colonial subject.  The Southern aspect of his thinking, which is often silenced in discussions of his work, is perhaps clearest in Monolingualism of the Other (1996).  It is also evident in his work on hospitality which, as Andrew Shyrock (2009) has shown, stands in a tradition of North African moral thought.  Davinder Ahluwalia (2010) has further argued that the entanglement of North and South shaped poststructuralism more broadly and is at the root of its commitment to dismantle the epistemes of coloniality.  Poststructuralism provides a substantial critique of European universalism and emphasizes the importance of difference and singularity.  thus, disrupting, time and again, various forms of hegemonic/ imperialist thinking.  Its critical impetus notwithstanding, poststructuralism as an intellectual project is located within the Northern academy, an institution that is shaped by, and also shaping, the coloniality of knowledge.  We therefore need a second level of border thinking.  not just North-South but also academiceveryday.  In this, we follow a number of scholars.  Houston Baker’s (1987) and Thomas McLaughlin’s (1996) work on vernacular theory, the decolonial Latin-American theorists (Mignolo, Grosfoguel, section 1), as well as Michael Lambek (2010.  1) who has argued that ‘ordinary ethics’ (just like ‘ordinary language philosophy’) is ‘embedded in the categories and functions of language and ways of speaking’.  Ordinary ethics is part of the interaction order as well as reflected in discourse.  Paying attention to ethics – both academic and everyday – allows us to rethink power since ethics is at the very basis of how we treat, and recognize, one another’s subjectivities.  By bringing academic and ordinary philosophy into a non-hierarchical conversation, we argue that these forms of knowledge are co-eval (to use Fabian’s [2002] term), and should be seen as forming part of a complex ‘ecology of knowledges’ (Sousa Santos 2014).  Derrida’s ethics of hospitality is a critique of Kant’s Third Article of Perpetual Peace (1795).  Kant positions hospitality as tolerance.  the other should be welcomed, but is required to stay within the threshold of what is deemed acceptable.  Derrida rejects tolerance outright and notes that ‘tolerance remains a scrutinized hospitality, always under surveillance’ (Borradori 2003.  127– 128).  Absolute hospitality, according to Derrida, has to be entirely unconditional.  it is a gift without expectation of reciprocity.  [A]bsolute hospitality requires that I open up my home and that I give .  .  .  to the absolute unknown, anonymous other, and that I give place to them, that I let them come, that I let them arrive .  .  .  without even asking reciprocity (entering into a pact) or even their names.  (Derrida 2000.  25.  our emphases) The coda is curious.  ‘or even their names’.  Why should we not even ask the names of our guests.  Is asking a form of not-welcoming.  Should we repress our curiosity about others.  Language certainly can be violent.  names as insults, naming as an attempt to determine the contours of the others’ diversity, to press them into sameness and to erase their difference.  This is what Derrida wishes to avoid.  Yet by doing so he risks falling into the trap of fetishizing the stranger (Ahmed 2000).  While it is essential that we recognize the other as singular and unique, to essentialize their alterity as unfathomable is ultimately a form of silencing.  it takes away voice and face, creating a fully anonymous other, an oriental fantasy (Drabinski 2011).  Speaking and indeed asking, we will argue below, is not necessarily a form of violence or an interpellation that reduces difference.  While we have the right to opacity, the right to resist those who wish to press us into universalized schemes of understanding, we are not fully incomprehensible (‘obscure’) to one another (although we might be at times.  Glissant 1997.  190).  In their recent work on sexuality and disability, Don Kulick and Jens Rydstr€om (2015.  117) note that it is important ‘to recognize both a fundamental sameness, but also, just as important, a crucial irreducible difference.  The space between familiar sameness and the in-manyways unknowable difference is the space of ethics’.  We thus walk a fine line in social interaction.  asking is risky as our questions can serve to position the other in ways that violate their uniqueness.  yet not asking limits the potential for engagement and creates fantasies of total difference.  Derrida’s ethical imperative not to ask requires of the host (and the guest) to suppress a form of affect that is deeply connected to hospitality, namely, curiosity about theLet us turn from academic philosophy to everyday ethics.  How is hospitality practiced and talked about in Forestville.  High levels of mobility have long been a feature of everyday life in the Eastern Cape.  from the political migrations of pre-colonial times, the formation of a diverse amaXhosa polity, to the labour migrations of coloniality and apartheid, reaching well into the present with continuing rural-urban migration (Wilson 1979.  Njeza 2000.  Deumert 2013).  Consequently, the feeling of being an outsider and relying on the hospitality of others is familiar to many.  It is an experience that is not only spoken about in conversation but it is also – because of its historical depth – reflected in proverbs and narratives (Mesatywa 1959.  Jordan 1973.  Soga 2014 [1932]).  Proverbs offer insights into ‘normative symbolic systems of meaning’ (Andersson 2012.  9), representing collective ‘wisdom’ and responses to recurrent ethical problems (Abrahams 1968).  Proverbs are interesting sites of discourse.  they do not reflect the voices of specific actors or institutions, but constitute forms of broadly distributed, shared and historically sedimented knowledge – a set of presuppositions – which circulate mainly through orality (on proverbs as communicative signs, see Mieder 2014.  on proverbs as performative ‘wisdom’, see Finnegan 2012).  Consider, for example, the local (isiXhosa) proverb unyawo alunampulo, literally ‘the foot has no nose’.  that is, one’s feet may carry one into a world where one’s face (‘the nose’) is not recognized, and when one is not recognized one relies on the kindness of others.  It is one of the many proverbs that can be said to someone who is found to be inhospitable.  There are many stories and proverbs about travellers in isiXhosa, and the ways in which they are welcomed and treated has long been documented in anthropological research (e. g.  Hammond-Tooke 1963).  When travellers were seen at a distance, a member of the homestead would be sent to bring them to the house.  The unknown, passing traveller, the stranger, thus becomes a visitor (a part of the household), and the same term is used to refer to both.  umhambi (from ukuhamba ‘to walk’).  The presence of a visitor in the house is typically welcomed and experienced as pleasurable.  visitors would bring gifts in the form of stories from their travels and also share whatever little food they carried with them.  In return, the host would look after the visitor, share space and food.  Thus, the strict division of host-visitor, which seems to underpin Derrida’s notion of hospitality, is blurred.  both give.  both share.  the relationship is one of reciprocity from the very first moment.  A positive relation to that which is distant, and thus to some degree unknown, is also evident in marriage preferences.  It is recommended that one marries not nearby, within the community, but outside of it.  induku entle ikiwa ezizweni ‘a beautiful stick is picked in other nations/lands’.  or intaka yaka ngoboya benye ‘a bird builds its nest with another bird’s feathers’.  There is a desire, an aspiration, for that which is distant and unknown.  it is seen as enriching rather than threatening local life.  Discussing the situation in the U. K. , Ahmed (2000) writes about discourses that position outsiders as ‘dangerous’, as figures who threaten community and who need to be removed or absorbed.  These discourses stand in stark contrast to those discussed here.  the presence of others is (affectively) welcomed and not feared.  It is relevant, considering the observations on the middle classes and Christianity in section 2, that – according to the perspective of some – hospitality is said to have disappeared with the arrival of missionaries and the associated violence of colonialism.  In the 1860s, Tiyo Soga wrote an essay about ‘The Believers and the Pagans’ (Amakholwa Namaqaba), where he gives ‘the example of the Pagan traveller who spent a cold night in the open veld because none of the Christians in the village would admit him into their homes’ (Jordan 1973.  55).  Soga uses the verb ukuvimba ‘to close, to bar, to refuse to share’ to describe the closing, not only of the dwelling, but also of human relations.  The opposite is ububele ‘maternal love, kindness, hospitality’, a central term in everyday discourse (see section 6).  This local ethos of hospitality was linked by A. C.  Jordan (1973) to the idea of ubuntu, an African socio-political philosophy that speaks of our entanglements with others and our obligations to others, especially those that are vulnerable (see Mnyaka and Mothlabi 2005.  Chirindo 2016).  It is important not to appropriate this way of thinking as Christianity.  ubuntu is not ‘love thy neighbour as you love thyself’.  Ubuntu emphasizes entanglement and relations, rather than charity and a love that seeks to absorb the other into the self (thus disrespecting the right to opacity).  Ubuntu is closer to Nietzsche’s (Thus spake Zarathustra) idea of Fernsten-Liebe (‘love for the most distant’).  It is important to note that, because of the ubuntu philosophy, the notion of ‘stranger’ does not exist in isiXhosa.  if everyone is a person, then no-one is a stranger. 4 Thus, while the idea of hospitality that is expressed here is absolute in the sense of Derrida – it gives place to the other – it also differs from it.  if we are all entangled with one another, then the host is not in a privileged position.  that is, both host and visitor give to one another.  What about asking.  How is this – which constitutes a dilemma for Derrida – addressed at the level of the everyday ethics.  The four well-known proverbs listed in (1) encourage, and indeed oblige, one to ask if one does not know.  (1) • imilomo ayibolanga ‘mouths have not decayed’ • umlomo awubekwa siziba ‘the mouth is not covered with cloth’ • inyathi ibuzwa kwabaphambili ‘you ask about the buffalo from those in front of you’ (i. e.  those who have seen the buffalo) • umbuzo awunatyala ‘the question has no crime’ (i. e.  it is no offence toBy encouraging asking, these proverbs license curiosity.  Those who are unknown and different are not only welcomed, their presence is a source of learning and understanding, the novelty pleasurable and enjoyable.  Social relations are thus managed through the instrumentalization and regulation of pleasure rather than its repression.  Derrida’s critique of Kant unsettles Northern ideas of tolerance and imagines the possibility of living-in-diversity without restricting the freedom of others.  Yet in order to do so he represses curiosity.  the speech act of asking is framed as problematic, as a form of violence to the other’s singularity.  By contrast, (isiXhosa) everyday philosophies, as discussed here, allow curiosity to be present.  it is not prying or nosiness, but interest and dialogue.  This makes it easier for hospitality to become an ordinary, and indeed enjoyable, practice, encouraging dialogue and engagement, rather than an ethical utopia characterized by notions of oughtness and obligation.  At the same time, however, curiosity can be destructive (and this is the basis of Derrida’s anxiety).  not any question can be asked, and knowledge obtained through asking can feed gossip, thus closing down engagement.  In the next two sections we draw on interview data, focusing, in particular, on the discursive expression of affect.  being welcomed or not welcomed, being hospitable or in-hospitable, is positioned as an experience, not simply an ethical imperative.  It is here that we see the collective wisdom of proverbs recontextualized in the voices of individuals talking about their everyday experiences of living-with-diversity.  The next two sections explore these voices – the articulation of hospitality (and inhospitality) in Forestville.  5.  QUEER VISIBILITIES.  CURIOSITY AND GOSSIP.  The first time we saw Menzi was at a distance.  we were walking near the taxi rank when we observed a small group of men moving right in the middle of the road, in the direction of the local township.  At the centre of the group was Menzi.  talking vivaciously, sporting a blond weave and dressed in highheeled boots, a cream-coloured neatly tailored jacket and designer trousers.  It was impossible to ignore him, not to turn to see what was going on, not to notice.  His presence was dissonant.  the space around the taxi rank is mostly male, drivers and petrol attendants.  that is, bodies who conform to normative ideas of gender and sexuality.  On that afternoon Menzi queered the space.  The second time, we heard about Menzi during an interview with three university students.  Linda (male, early 20s), Thandi (female, early 20s) and Nomonde (female, early 20s).  We were talking about people in Forestville who are known to be gay or lesbian and Menzi was discursively just as visible as he was on the street.  In extract (2)5 the memory of Menzi is coexperienced, his name is repeated in mutual – joyful (i. e.  affective) – recognition.  (2) Linda.  there is one guy I know= Thandi.  =because there’re quite a [few Linda.  [Menzi= Nomonde.  =ja, Menzi, ja ((chuckles)) Linda.  they are like whatever= Thandi.  =they don’t care, they’re like Linda.  ((emphatic)) uMenzi6 ((laughs)) Thandi.  everybody knows his name Nomonde.  sure thing Linda.  does weaves Zodwa (female, in her 40s, see above) also pointed us to Menzi.  She didn’t know his name, but directed us to a hair parlour, specializing in weaves.  ‘that’s where he goes, you’ll find him there’.  And indeed we did.  He laughed at the end of our interview with him, acknowledging his visibility, and said selfmockingly.  ‘everyone knows me, I am a social butterfly’.  In other interviews we learnt more about known, and thus visible, gay and lesbian individuals in the town.  the gay son of a church minister and his lesbian friend, the hairdresser next to the police station, the lesbian who used to work at a fast food place, but is now training to be a police officer, and the other one who drives an ambulance and recently married.  Yet, not everyone is visible and the notion of ‘closet cases’ also appeared across interviews.  Zola (male, mid-30s), for example, commented that many are ‘shy’ and keep to themselves (baneentloni ‘they have shyness’).  But he nevertheless notices and sees them, is aware of their presence.  uyabona abo nabo ‘you see quite a few here and there’.  Zethu Matebeni (2011) notes with regard to Johannesburg that being visible is not always easy.  visibility can create a sense of community and belonging, but it can also mark one as an outsider.  Being visible attracts attention and curiosity, and people might ask questions.  Robert Ryder (2015) argues that curiosity is the affect that lies at the heart of hospitality.  He draws on Pierre Klossowski’s erotic trilogy, Les Lois de Hospitalite ‘The Laws of Hospitality’ (1965), where curiosity is described not simply as reflecting a quest for knowledge but as the ‘potentiality of the hospitable soul’.  Asking is the speech act which brings curiosity to the fore, and in doing so ideas of private personhood are eroded.  we can no longer close ourselves, and others, off – ‘curiosity opens the door, so to speak, between self and other’ (Ryder 2015.  163).  In other words, curiosity allows for relationality and entanglement, the basis of ubuntu.  Ryder’s discussion of curiosity as pleasure resonates strongly with the everyday philosophies we discussed in the previous section.  Queer visibilities and curiosity about them can be seen to work in tandem.  that which is personal (sexuality) becomes visible if it is displayed-to-be-seen, and can then be engaged with through the speech act of asking.  In our interview with Menzi, there was an intense discussion on the ethics of asking.  Menzi sees asking, and indeed curiosity (which in turn is linked to knowledge and learning), as a good thing (extract 3).  (3) We will be curious, ‘what’s happening there. ’, ‘what’s happening here. ’, talk to us and then, that curiosity, rather than to assume, get to know, ask, don’t assume, ask, ask, put yourself in someone else’s shoes, get to know that person before you pass judgement.  And with a sense of real disgust he speaks about ‘the WORST place he has ever been’.  It was one of South Africa’s northern provinces where ‘people were so RUDE, they don’t give you time, they don’t ask, they just assume, they pass judgement, they attack before knowing’.  Menzi is accustomed to answering questions about his sexuality, especially from older people.  As he talks about this though, his voice moves from patient explanation to slight irritation (thus displaying, again, affect).  (4) Abantu abadala [‘the old people’], they are not exposed, as I said before, lack of knowledge, u’ba [‘that’], and then uyintoni wena, uyintombi okanye uyinkwenkwe [‘what are you.  are you a boy or a girl. ’], those kinds of questions, so I have to sit down and explain, and explain and explain [sounding slightly exasperated].  I am a boy, I am a boy attracted to boys, I am gay.  That’s how it is.  I am not a girl.  I am not trying to be a girl.  [Emphatic] I’ll never be a girl! The irritation expressed by Menzi shows that asking has an ambiguous status.  it is preferred to assuming, but can also become annoying (if the same question is asked repeatedly).  Thus, asking can mask speech acts of mocking, teasing and/or jousting.  asking not because one does not know, but asking as an interactional challenge which makes difference visible (rather than to pretend that it does not exist).  These interactional routines are often initiated with the phrase yintoni.  (‘what is. ’).  For example, when one of us started growing dreads a common question, asked by older people, was.  yintoni ke le ilapha entloko.  (‘what is this there on your head. ’).  We suggest that yintoni can be seen as an example of discursive ritualization (in the sense discussed by Lempert 2013).  even though it can be mocking or teasing, by asking for clarification one also opens the space for relation, engagement and dialogue.  Menzi is astutely aware that it is but a small move from curiosity to gossip.  from opening the door to closing it.  While it will ‘never get physical’, certain people will ‘pass comments’, talk about you (and your sexuality), rather than with you.  In this context he mentioned a particular phrase which indexes, to him, a sense of tolerance but also exclusion.  ‘oh gay, okay’ – the interpellation, the identification of the other as ‘gay’, closes dialogue and objectifies.  Similarly, Shareen (female, in her 50s) noted that while no one will ever be excluded from the community, knowledge about diverse sexualities still leads to gossip.  (5) I think it is still a good gossip story if you come to Forestville and they find out that you, or your child is gay, it will give a good gossip but you won’t get like shut out, you won’t get like no you gay, you sit there to the side, you won’t getShareen’s comment positions gossip in two ways.  (a) it is located in time (i. e.  being gay is ‘still’, at the present moment, a source for gossip, indicating that times are changing and that we are at the interface of old and new).  and (b) it expresses an affective stance towards gossip as enjoyable (‘a good gossip’).  However, once curiosity becomes gossip, engagement with the other returns to the space of privacy.  gossip is limited to a specific group, creating insiders and outsiders.  The discourses discussed here are not simply representational, talking about what is happening.  they are also shot through with affect – from pleasure to annoyance, from curiosity to gossip.  These tensions and ambiguities are central to the ways in which inclusion and exclusion, hospitality and in-hospitality, are experienced and practiced in everyday life.  6.  ACCEPTANCE, KINDNESS/UBUBELE AND THE PERSISTENCE OF DISCRIMINATION.  Making one’s sexuality visible does not always elicit a response.  sometimes people are curious, sometimes they are judgmental, and sometimes they just accept, without asking.  Reflecting on his fieldwork in Ermelo, a small town in Mpumalanga, Graeme Reid (2013.  97) writes.  ‘Many gays appeared to enjoy a high level of social integration and acceptance within local communities’.  The situation was similar in Forestville.  Whenever we asked about sexual discrimination in our interviews, responses were given without hesitation.  there is no problem, here we ‘live-and-let-live’ (John, in his 60s).  And no matter how much we probed, the discourse did, at no stage, move beyond gossip as to who is and who isn’t gay or lesbian, what they wear and where they hang out.  Only some of those who were strongly involved in one of the local churches, expressed some reservations.  ‘it’s your choice, but for me, in my religion, I don’t want it for my kids’ (Shareen).  We received quite similar responses whenever we asked about the migrant traders in town.  while xenophobic discourses and violence have been described for South Africa’s metropolitan areas, they were conspicuous by their absence in Forestville – again, people felt there is no problem.  ‘places like Forestville are pretty chilled out when it comes to xenophobic attacks and all that, because they really, like, become part of the community’ (Nomonde).  Zodwa, who had worked in Cape Town and only moved back recently, commented on the difference between Cape Town and Forestville.  Her description of these differences (extract 6) is imbued, again, with affect.  she was ‘shocked’.  people are ‘happy’ and ‘free’ in Forestville, and even violence appears to her to be of a different kind.  (6) The only thing that I was shocked when I came here is that gays and lesbians, it’s like, a normal thing to them, even the foreigners, the foreigners are just happy here, it’s just once in a while when they rob them, but they don’t stab them, like, Cape Town, it’s totally different, no here, they are just free.  Zodwa continued as follows.  ‘it is you, and you, you are doing your own thing, I am doing my own things, that’s all, people are more accepting’.  The idea of freedom, of letting people be, also surfaced in the interview with Zola (extract 7.  also extract 9, below).  (7) Babafree, ubone ukuba ufree lo mntu uzenzela le nto yakhe, akhukho mntu umhoyileyo.  So andingeni ndawo andingeni ndawo kwinto yempilo yakhe, makaziphilele nam ndiqhubekeke nobam ubomi.  ‘They are free, you see this person is free to do their thing, no one pays attention to them.  So I have no business to interfere with their way of life, let them live their way and I should continue with my own life. ’ There exists, thus, an important counterpoint to the curiosity described in the previous section.  a non-judgemental acceptance of the other, a sense of ‘letting be’ (what Chitando and van Klinken [2016.  4] refer to as a ‘culture of discretion’).  Linda, Thandi and Nomonde framed this attitude – which they positioned as ‘township’ rather than ‘middle class’ – in terms of ‘mentality’ (extract 8).  (8) Thandi.  they have this mentality of, if it doesn’t affect me= Linda.  =if it doesn’t affect me, it’s none of my business= Nomonde.  =I don’t mind, I don’t, it’s none of my business The feeling of being ‘free’ was echoed by Menzi with regard to his own experience.  ‘always free [in Forestville], but, eh, the minute you step out of Eastern Cape’.  Menzi positions the city as the place of social surveillance (extract 9).  This view of the city goes against the ways in which the city is usually imagined.  that is, as a place of freedom (versus the rural, which is commonly portrayed as a place of surveillance, judgement and prejudice, e. g.  Leitner 2012).  (9) Apha [‘here’] it’s like, you are doing you, I am doing me, what you are doing for yourself does not concern me, so I don’t bother myself with what you’re doing .  .  .  [in the city] everyone is in your business!!! It is here that we see traces of Derrida’s anxiety about the question – the fine line between asking and being in someone else’s business.  Later in our conversation Menzi went further and argued that what made life possible and liveable was not only being left to do one’s own thing, but also the quality of ububele ‘kindness’, an ethno-metapragmatic notion that is linked to ubuntu philosophy and emphasizes the non-judgemental acceptance (bayamkela ‘they are accepting’) of difference.  Thus, the everyday ethics-of-living-together is rarely expressed as a sense of oughtness.  rather, it is located somewhere between pleasure (providing access to novelty and knowledge) and a kindness that is integral to human relations.  Others emphasized that because Forestville was idolophu encinci ‘a small town’, it was important to get along with one another.  Andile (in his early 20s) commented on the need to live together, and recognized that in the end we are all different from one another, we are all strange to one another.  (10) So mna ndiyitshomi nawe.  And ke ngoku uyabona ke ngoku iForestville, incinci iForestville, so ke ngoku xa ndizakucaphukela igay yakowenu so ndicaphula wena ke ngoku uyaqonda.  So, then ke ngoku into eyenzekayo nathi, sibathathe nje ngabantu abaright, because nabo baziphilela ngendlela yabo.  Uyabona.  You can’t change indlela yomntu afuna ukuphila ngayo because yindldela wena ozikhethele yona.  Ifunny lo nto kuye uba hayi mna ndistraight, uyabona.
