INTRODUCTION.  This study has both theoretical and investigative aims, with the theme of this Special Issue providing an impetus to pause and rethink its potential contribution to knowledge.  In terms of theory, the aim is to contribute to dialogue about research in the global South, encompassing research on gender, sexuality and language and to do so while focussing on New Zealand’s idiosyncratic, unsettled ‘global Southern’ status (i. e.  New Zealand as potentially representing both ‘the North in the South’ and ‘the South in the North’).  In terms of investigative aims, this study queries masculinity performance in a classroom-based community of practice and its relationship with sexuality, colonial hegemony and heteronormativity.  Crucially for this Special Issue, Hokowhitu (2008) has pointed out in the context of New Zealand that gendered and sexual identity practices in the Paciﬁc region might remain incomprehensible to Northern epistemologies of gender theory.
