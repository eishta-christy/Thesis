1.  FOREWORD.  Aiming at analyzing the effects of the internationalization of universities, a joint research team from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM) and Hong Kong University (HKU) studied the socialization process experienced by a group of Chinese and Spanish students enrolled in mobility programs.  Since exchange students must show ï¬‚uency in both relational and academic discourses (which includes the ability to move through institutional and social spaces with ease.  Blommaert 2013), we tried to identify which practices international students deploy in order to enter the alien environment.  To do so, we traced a group of exchange undergraduates and analyzed their interactional practices at institutional and non-institutional spaces.  The socialization networks in which students take part are suitable sites for analyzing the negotiation of ideologies and subjectivities, and for exploring the relationship between stancetaking and recent forms of cosmopolitanism.  This is why, in this paper, we address such networks in our analysis of a communicative event situated on the fringe of a focus group (a research technique) and an informal gathering (naturally situated interaction).  Over a dinner party organized to inaugurate the research project in Madrid, the participants (two local researchers, five Chinese students and two local students, one originally from Taiwan) share meanings, recall semiotic resources to interpret the meaning of elements of sociocultural life, jointly construct intersubjectivities and negotiate their social identities within interaction (Jaworski and Thurlow 2009).  However, shared enactments of stance require complex strategies that go beyond the customary understanding of stance negotiation (cf.
