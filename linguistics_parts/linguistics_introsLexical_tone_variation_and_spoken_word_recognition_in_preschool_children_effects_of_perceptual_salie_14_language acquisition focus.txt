I N T R O D U C T I O N.  In order to recognize spoken words, children must harbor a very precise set of expectations about the relationship between sound and meaning.  Formulating this set of expectations is complicated by the inordinate variability intrinsic to human speech.  Learners must learn from experience how to assign appropriate relevance to the full range of variation in speech, gradually converging upon a phonological system that is closely aligned with the structure of the native lexicon.  Phonological specification within the developing lexicon has been extensively studied in Romance and Germanic languages, such as English, Spanish, and French (e. g.  Mani & Plunkett, .  Nazzi, .  Swingley & Aslin, , .  White & Morgan, ).  In contrast, such investigations remain a relative rarity in tone languages, yet tone languages comprise the linguistic majority.  They are widely spoken around the world and are more frequent than non-tone (or intonation) languages (Fromkin, .  Yip, ).  Moreover, over half of the world’s population speak a native tone language (Fromkin, ), yet empirical studies of language acquisition focus predominantly on native learners of intonation languages.  A by-product of a disproportionately weighty focus on languages such as English for understanding of the phonological lexicon is that effects of vowels and consonants on word recognition have been widely researched.
