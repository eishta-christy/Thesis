INTRODUCTION.  There is growing research into relatively privileged forms of migration, such as that termed lifestyle migration.  a concept that frames such movements in terms of choice and possibility rather than necessity, and which acknowledges the role played by structural and economic conditions (Benson 2016).  Such studies have utilised migrant narratives to understand how the speakers make sense of their lives within that particular sociocultural context.  While other forms of migration, such as labour movements, have undergone analysis of positioning in interaction (De Fina 2006), there has been little attention paid towards interactive positioning in lifestyle migration contexts.  By integrating two datasets of discourse – one online and one face to face – this paper presents a grounded interpretation of how a British migrant couple in France jointly construct a narrative world that is both framed and disrupted by prevailing ideologies.  To date, lifestyle migration researchers are at work in a range of global contexts and migrant nationalities, including studies of British migration to destinations such as Spain (O’Reilly 2012), Portugal (Torkington 2015) and France (Benson 2011).  Within the British contexts there is some coherence across common themes of a search for a better life abroad, conceptualising a postmodern escape to a simpler life that nevertheless perceives such migration as a purchasable, consumption-driven commodity.  Yet we should be wary of viewing such migration unproblematically as privileged.  some migrants articulate the move in terms of constraint, particularly when the region has been selected due to lower property prices (Lawson 2016).  Migrants can also be vulnerable to economic and political developments, such as the uncertainty following the 2016 Brexit vote for the U. K.  to leave the European Union (EU).  This intersection of lifestyle and economic factors has led to criticism of the term lifestyle migration as imprecise (Huete, Mantecon and Estevez 2013), since it hinders consistent deﬁnitions.  Yet with such a varied array of lifestyle migration contexts, we might question whether precision is an essential component of the overall concept.  More clarity and theoretical consistency has been afforded by the recent trend to include choice and possibilities (Croucher 2012) as key aspects within the term lifestyle migration.  This acknowledges the role of economic capital as an available resource and allows lifestyle migration to be viewed through a broad analytical lens that accounts for variation in the ways that people take up the available resources.  The paper therefore takes the perspective of lifestyle migration as an ability to move elsewhere using resources that offer a choice of possibilities for a different, often better, lifestyle.  Further critiques have focused on the idea of lifestyle migration as an unproblematic form of independently chosen self-realisation.  Researchers such as Benson (2011) argue that the everyday realities of the new life can generate ambivalence between former imaginings and lived experiences, commonly seen alongside a desire to self-identify as distinct from one’s (British) compatriots, who are often presented along stereotypical lines.  This paper shows what a focus on language in interaction can reveal, particularly concerning the ways that such processes of distinction develop linguistically as dynamic aspects of self-representation.  While the concept of stance has usefully identiﬁed indexicality in language, for example Stockburger’s (2015.  237) exploration of stances against ‘stereotypical social types’, recent developments in positioning theory are more speciﬁcally tailored towards relations between the roles negotiated in interaction and prevailing social and moral themes.  Analysing positioning as a social action at three levels of the interaction offers scope for revealing more complex and dynamic identity representations at the level of the story (tale), the interaction (telling) and the wider ideological level.  The framework has already been tested in migration contexts, as seen in De Fina’s (2013) analysis of migrant orientations to ideologies about migration.  Yet the common dyad of interviewer-interviewee can miss the rich elasticity of identity representations that might emerge within joint interviews.  For example, Damari’s (2010) interview with a binational couple revealed variance in positioning between speakers with cultural and demographic differences.  Nonetheless, it is also possible for participants to share a culture and ideological stance, but to differ in their interpretations of how to represent their actions.  In this paper, I demonstrate what a positioning analysis can reveal about such variance, in the context of a British couple who positioned themselves in contrasting ways when their lived experiences aligned them with prevailing and negative cultural stereotypes.  This paper forms part of a larger study of British migrants living in the Ariege departement of France, with an overarching research question.  how do British migrants in Ariege, France, construct and define their identities in discourse.  This paper firstly examines data from a digital British support forum to show how an ideological landscape is visible in the online interactions of members.  This is followed by analysis of extracts from an interview with a British couple – both users of the forum – to explore how interactants differ in their negotiation around these ideologies.  The results add a new perception to our understanding of the dynamic and contextually emergent nature of the reporting of agency.  Speakers who share an overall perspective on the prevailing ideologies can nevertheless be at variance in how their representations of their actual lived experience match the idealised version of the ‘right’ kind of migrant.  THE SELF AND THE ‘OTHER’ IN BRITISH MIGRATION.  A thematic thread that runs through the literature on British lifestyle migration is that of intra-group distinction and stereotyping.  A report on global British emigration by Sriskandarajah and Drew (2006.  30) referred to a tendency for expatriate Britons to ‘distinguish themselves’ from stereotypical British communities who are seen as unwilling or unable to integrate.  Benson’s ethnographic studies in France drew attention to a similar theme of distinction that revolved around a particular ‘moral position’ among British migrants in the Lot departement of France (Benson 2011.  30), where ‘other’ Britons were described as unprepared, lacking cultural (especially linguistic) capital and showing dependence on each other.  Drake and Collard’s (2007.  28) research in Normandy similarly identified an ‘appropriate model of behaviour’ whereby respondents were keen to be seen as making an effort to speak the local language and integrate.  Such observations are not confined to local contexts, and O’Reilly (2001) acknowledged the media’s role in constructing stereotypes of the British in Spain.  In a recent corpus analysis of British press articles that referenced British migration to France, Lawson (2015) identified a pattern of negative representations that included frequent associations of the British with a difficulty or reluctance to speak French, a continuing reliance on British items and English speaking services, and references to British ‘ghetto’ communities.  Benson and Osbaldiston (2014) noted how these kinds of categorisations and distinctions against the ‘other’ are widespread within studies of lifestyle migration, not just British, with migrants seemingly conscious of how their chosen lifestyle and related activities represent social or cultural value within the search for a new life.  As symbolic value is applied to social actions, often in terms of being integrated (Lawson 2016), so an opportunity emerges for ideologies – opinions, explanations, norms or values of a ‘group-based, shared framework’ (van Dijk 1990.  177) – to develop into a recognised value system relating to (in)appropriate forms of migrant behaviour.  As speakers orient towards a particular evaluative stance, they contribute towards the construction and maintenance of the value system.  It has been acknowledged that lifestyle migration owes as much to structural opportunities as to agency (O’Reilly 2012), yet choice and agency are nevertheless intrinsic to lifestyle migration.  People make decisions of where and how to live, explaining and justifying their actions and choices when pursuing a new life.  There is therefore potential for reflexivity in how they interpret these actions and tell a particular version of themselves in narrative discourse.  For the British living in the rural Lot departement of France, Benson (2011.  40) concluded that migration was perceived as a ‘risky act’ through which the British were able to augment their sense of individual agency and achievement, self-presenting as ‘pioneers’ with ‘get up and go’.  Benson argued that the frequent assertion of their agency worked to keep any uncertainty and ambivalence, such as their continuing outsider status, at bay.  The notion of an ideal migrant against the stereotypical ‘other’ therefore presents a resource for positive self-identiﬁcation, and one that is of particular interest when the discursive representation of choice and agency is problematic.  For example, limited language skills and less than full knowledge of the new way of life can present barriers to living the ‘appropriate’ model of behaviour, resulting in a struggle to reconcile the ideal and imagined life with how it is actually experienced.  As Torkington (2015.  227) noted in the Algarve, this can lead to identity dilemmas within discourse, such as where an admission of not speaking Portuguese conﬂicted with a stated moral obligation for the British to learn it.  Using a focus on linguistic representations, Torkington identiﬁed a range of both internal (‘I’m too busy’) and external agency repertoires (‘everyone here speaks English’) used to negotiate around these dilemmas.  The concept of agency – a way to identify the ‘capacity by which individuals perceive themselves to be able to act in meaningful ways’ (Miller 2014.  142) – is therefore particularly useful for theorising and analysing the complexities within self-identiﬁcation in lifestyle migration, where it is negotiated in the face of prevailing ideologies about appropriate behaviour.  Going beyond a focus on what respondents say they do, analysis of speaker positioning can explore more dynamic interactional aspects as migrants represent the control they have over their choices and actions.  While members of the online forum make binary representations of the ideal migrant self and the ‘other’, the discourse analysis of interviews demonstrates how negotiation around the prevailing ideologies results in more ﬂuidity.  The aim of this paper, then, is to take a relatively novel approach by pairing local data with that from the wider context, in order to analyse how migrants negotiate inconsistencies where their actions do not align with those of a socially imposed value system.  <Middle> THE CURRENT STUDY.  CONTEXT, DATA AND METHOD.  The research context of the Ariege.  The Ariege is one of 13 departements (administrative divisions) in the recently created Occitanie region of south-west France (it previously lay within the MidiPyrenees region).  It is relatively rural and one of the least populated departments in France.  Despite a continuing loss of local inhabitants to seek employment elsewhere, it is also one of the fastest growing departements, with sufficient incoming migration in recent years to result in an annual net increase of around +1400 (Insee 2009).  It is difficult to obtain precise numbers of Britons residing in France as there has been no requirement for EU citizens to register, whether one resides permanently in France or buys a holiday home there.  However, figures suggest that during the period 2001–2006, more than a third of the 16,600 foreigners to settle in rural areas of the Midi-Pyrenees were British (Touret, Bourniquel and Poisson 2010).  Nevertheless, the estimated number of Britons in the Ariege specifically is relatively low at 30 percent of foreigners, compared with ‘more than 45%’ for the Lot, for example (Touret, Bourniquel and Poisson 2010.  29).  An integrated approach to data analysis.  There has been criticism (Benwell and Stokoe 2006, cited in De Fina 2013.  44) of studies that attempt to link macro and micro contexts without providing an empirical basis for such links.  While the interview data of Benson and others have provided an ethnographic entry point into the lives of British migrants in France and patterns of repertoires, there is potential for circularity of arguments if they emerge from analysis of interviews alone.  As Antaki et al.  (2003) argue, we should be wary of using interview data to not only identify and justify the existence of an ideology, but at the same time explain the discourse in terms of such ideologies.  Deppermann (2013) raised this as a key methodological question within narrative work that aims to relate local positioning acts to more macro structures, reviewing ethnographic approaches as well as those that seek recurrent, broad patterns, or iterativity, across larger samples of data (Georgakopoulou 2013).  De Fina (2013.  54), for example, presented ‘important similarities’ across a repertoire that included local migrant narratives and broadcasts on American radio.  Nevertheless, a detailed integration of data to investigate the relationship between macro and micro positioning, using different data contexts but within the same community, is relatively novel within narrative analysis.  The current study shows how a mixed methods approach can provide a robust foundation to any interpretations of how ideologies are actually constructed and maintained within and beyond a local interview context.  The study developed via two research sub-questions that show how the first – an exploration of how lifestyle migration is mediated and identity represented within an online forum – can give valuable insights to a second question that asks what does local migrant discourse reveal about the expression of identity and agency within a lifestyle migration context.  The digital forum offered naturally occurring data from a discernible and mutually-engaged community, some of whom were approached for interview.  In this way, the data from the online forum for British migrants provided an empirical basis with which to examine local orientations to wider ideologies.  This forum belonged to a website that catered for English-speaking residents in the Ariege, offering information on many topics.  The forum had a number of categories where members could post and ask for advice, offer information or announce that they were moving to the area.  Members needed to be registered in order to post, but the posts themselves could be read by anyone.  The website had an English owner who maintained an active presence as forum moderator.  The site became subject to frequent hacking attacks and it closed in 2011.  After introducing the project on the forum in 2011, I invited members to fill out a questionnaire, which led to twelve interviews.  At the same time, after obtaining permission from the site owners I began a qualitative selection of data.  Threads were selected from a variety of interactions across a range of post types in order to gain a range of perspectives, including the forum’s support mechanisms as well as the type of conflict that sometimes developed.  As the research questions related to identity representation, some threads were selected as they showed positioning strategies that indexed social categorisations of Britons in France.  The total dataset consists of nine topic threads that were posted between 2004 and 2008.  Threads vary from the shortest, consisting of four posts (726 words) by four members, to the longest thread that had 43 contributions (5557 words) by 14 members.  I have preserved anonymity by changing all online names and taking care to remove any identifying material.  The interview extracts within this paper are from one of twelve interviews carried out with forum members during October 2011 in the Ariege.  All respondents were British, heterosexual, owners of their property and only one did not live full time in France.  The interviews were semi-structured in that questions loosely followed the list of issues to be explored, such as probing how participants felt in relation to other migrants, stereotypes of the British, and their use of the forum.  Free association questions were included to introduce concepts without preconceptions.  ‘Do you feel part of a British community in the Ariege.
