I N T R O D U C T I O N.  Books have long been recognized as a source of input for children learning language in cultures with widespread literacy.  Investigations into the relationship between books and language development have typically been of two types.  One is research showing a relationship between frequency of children’s book experiences and broad measures of language development such as literacy or preliteracy skills (see Bus, van IJzendoorn & Pellegrini, , for a review) or vocabulary size (e. g.  Lyytinen, Laasko & Poikkeus, .  Raikes et al. , .  see Fletcher & Reese, , for a review).  Second are studies examining the occurrence of specific linguistic elements in children’s books, trying to link them directly to knowledge.  for instance, there are recent studies showing that children’s books contain more complex sentence structures than naturalistic spoken input (Cameron-Faulkner & Noble, ), and that there exists a correlation between text exposure and the production of more complex syntactic structures (Montag & MacDonald, ).  This latter kind of investigation ultimately relies on knowing the actual books children are being read.  However, examinations of children’s books have not typically been done with access to this information.  Instead, proxies for this information have been used in selecting the books for examination.  Cameron-Faulkner and Noble (), for instance, used sales information to select books for examination, while Montag and MacDonald () analyzed corpus data (specifically, the Corpus of Contemporary American English, Davies, –).  Although this way of selecting text for analysis can tell us a great deal about the overall nature of the language that is generally contained in children’s books, it is difficult to make any more specific claims, given that the books that children have are not necessarily the books that they are read.  One must also take into account the fact that children’s books, even ones targeted to the same age range, can differ in the amount and nature of text they contain, sometimes in ways which are predictable due to genre.  For instance, storybooks contain complete sentences, whereas word books are often pictures accompanied by single words labelling the pictures, and storybooks expose children to culturally normative narrative structures whereas information books may not.  Moreover, genre differences carry with them interactional implications that can further affect input (Nyhout & O’Neill, .  cf.  Leech & Rowe, ).  For instance, there is evidence that there is more variability in what parents say when reading vocabulary-focused books as compared to storybooks (Price, Van Kleeck & Huberty, ).  Thus, having a more accurate picture of the books children are being read would be useful for researchers interested in the potential role of bookreading activities in language development.  To this end we conducted an Internet survey of parents and caregivers, asking about the English-language books they frequently read to their children.  Because of the linguistic features we are ultimately interested in examining in books (the ultimate reason we wanted this information), the survey targeted people reading to children aged – months, an age group we know relatively little about in terms of bookreading (Fletcher & Reese, ).  This short notice is a description of the resulting dataset, which is available to researchers in multiple formats at the following web-address.  <http. //linguistics. ubc. ca/ubc-ibdb/>, or by request from the first author.  It is hosted by the Department of Linguistics at the University of British Columbia and there is a commitment to retain the link permanently.  We ask that people cite this report when using the database.  <Middle> DESCRIPTION OF THE DATABASE.  Data collection.  The survey was conducted beginning in January of  through to June of .  The invitation to participate was posted on a lab website, which described the study briefly and contained a link to the actual survey at FluidSurveys. com.  (FluidSurveys is a Canadian company, and all their data are hosted at a site in Canada, in accordance with the requirements of our IRB. ) The study was described as being about children’s books in English for parents and caregivers of children ages – months.  It did not specifically mention picture books.  The link to the lab webpage was circulated via the lab’s Twitter account, and from there it was recirculated via Twitter and Facebook by other Twitter and Facebook users.  Although many of the initial recirculaters were friends and family, the invitation was also recirculated by people we did not know, including more generic Twitter accounts (i. e.  accounts not associated with a specific person’s name).  Overview of survey questions.  The survey first asked participants to list the five books they currently most frequently read to their child.  There was another place where the respondent could list any other books they frequently read to their child.  Then the information about the five most frequently read books was used to populate further questions asking about their reading habits for each book.  Specifically, participants were asked how much they stick to the text on the page versus say things not written in the book.  They provided this additional information (about reading habits) for each of the five most frequently read books individually.  They did not provide this additional information for any extra books they listed.  Participants were also asked questions about the child’s age (in -month increments), sex, gestational status (full-term or not), and about the occurrence of any hearing, language, or cognitive diagnoses.  (We use the term sex here as a child’s primary sexual characteristics are more apparent than their gender at this age. ) We also asked about the child’s language production (which might be expected to influence book choices) to get a very general sense of the child’s level of language development.  Specifically we asked whether the child was (i) producing any words, (ii) producing more than ten understandable words, (iii) producing any two-word sequences, and (iv) producing any sequences of more than three words.  The four language production questions were in a Y/N format.  We also asked questions about the respondent.  their gender, age, and level of education.  The specific wording of each question appears in Appendix A.  Responses.  The database that is posted on-line contains , responses.  , of these are fully complete (meaning they answered the questions about the child and the respondent, and entered at least one English book title).  Thirty-four responses were missing some or all of the information about the respondent, but had complete information on the child.  Four were missing some information about both the child and the respondent.  All in all, there are , responses with complete information about the child and at least one book.  We did not restrict the questionnaire to respondents who were in any specific geographic location, but it was clear that we were interested in books in English.  IP information (not included in the database) indicates that most of the responses came from North America, although there were numerous responses from people in other countries as well, mostly predominantly English-speaking countries (e. g.  Australia, New Zealand), but not entirely.  Some respondents included non-English book titles in their five most frequently read books.  Those titles are not included in the released data.  Brief overview of the data.  The data were not collected from a random sample.  rather, respondents tended to be people we knew, people who knew the people we knew, people who knew those people, etc. , in addition to being people who read to their children and are interested enough in reading to children that they were willing to participate in a survey on the topic.  In some sense, surveys are never conducted with truly random samples as people have to select into the sample voluntarily.  However, given the fact that our friends and family were possibly more likely to complete and recirculate the survey invitation and link, at least initially, and given the nature of our immediate circle of friends and family (e. g.  high SES), it is important to understand the distributional properties of the data.  Children.  Five hundred and ninety-one of the responses were from caregivers of boys and  responses were from caregivers of girls.  Table  shows the age distribution by child sex.  Age information was not provided for two children.  one boy and one girl.  The other questions about the child are incomplete for three boys – one aged – months, one aged – months, and one aged – months – and five girls – two aged – months, one aged – months, one aged – months, and one aged – months.  Sex information was not supplied for four children.  One was in the – months age group, one was in the – months group, one was in the – months group, and the fourth was in the – months age group.  These children are not included in Table .  The rest of the child information is complete for these four children.  One thousand and thirty-six of the children were born full-term.  Twentysix had been identified as having a diagnosed hearing, language, or cognitive delay.  This information was not provided for two of the children (both girls).  Eight hundred and forty-eight of the children were producing at least some words, with  producing more than ten understandable words.  Two hundred and fifty-seven children were not yet producing any words.  Five hundred and eighty-three of the children were producing two-word sequences at the time of the survey, and  of the children were producing sequences of more than three words.  Some of the language development information was missing for seven of the children (three boys, four girls).  Parents/caregivers.  This is the biggest source of missing information, although most of the parents/caregivers did provide this information.  some or all of the information about the respondent is missing for only eighteen of the boys and nineteen of the girls, and one child whose sex was not specified.  One thousand and seventy-three parents/caregivers provided information about their gender.  , identified themselves as female,  as male, and one selected other.  Thus, there are not enough non-female respondents in the dataset to be able to carry out meaningful comparisons based on parent/caregiver gender.  The ages of the respondents who answered the age question are as follows.   parents/caregivers were under ,  were – years of age,  were –,  were –,  were –,  were –,  were –, and one was over .  The educational level of the sample was highly non-representative of the general population in North America – % of our respondents who answered the question about education had completed a bachelor’s degree or higher, which contrasts with a rate of % for the population in Canada (Statistics Canada, ) and around % for the United States (United States Census Bureau, ), the two countries from which most of our responses came.  Note that the ages included in the data from the two countries are slightly different, both from each other, and from the age categories we used in our questionnaire.  The Canadian data only include adults aged – from  (Statistics Canada, ), while the US data are for adults aged  years and above (United States Census Bureau, ), whereas our sample includes some caregivers who are younger than  years of age.  (We do not know the location of all respondents.  We did not ask about location.  however, the program sometimes, but not always, automatically supplied it, presumably on the basis of the IP address.  As we did not ask any questions about location, it is not part of the official dataset, and so information about respondents’ locations is not being shared. ) No respondent had only completed elementary school.  For  respondents the highest level of education completed was high school.  One hundred and fifty-four respondents had completed some higher education and  had completed a Bachelor’s degree.  Three hundred and seven respondents had completed a Master’s degree of some kind, while  had a PhD.  A further  had completed a professional post-graduate degree.  Books.  The book responses appearing in the posted dataset are the result of some data cleaning and organization.  First, research assistants went through the survey, looking for book titles that appeared to be the same despite being entered in the survey differently by different respondents.  When such examples were found the titles were adjusted to be consistent.  An example.  some respondents typed “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” and others typed “Very Hungry Caterpillar”.  Instances of Very Hungry Caterpillar were adjusted to read The Very Hungry Caterpillar.  Then authors’ names were entered into the dataset.  Some titles are too generic to definitively associate with an author – there are numerous children’s books available with that title and none are common, or there is no title that is a complete match.  In such cases, no author name was entered.  Occasionally respondents provided author information, but this was the exception rather than the rule.  When they did so, this information was retained.  In several instances respondents provided authors for titles that would otherwise have been too generic to assign an author to.  The result of this is that books with the same title appear in the dataset with and without authors.  (In one instance only, these rules resulted in a title being associated with two different authors.  it was a well-known children’s title and so all instances of the title reported without an author were associated with the well-known version of the title, but the one instance where an author’s name was provided was retained.  Presumably the respondent provided the author’s name because it was not the more common book of the same name. ) Sometimes the author information is actually publisher/series information that is part of the title rather than true authorship, e. g.  “Usborne” or “Scholastic”, as this was sometimes enough to definitively identify the book.  Sometimes respondents entered series names rather than individual book titles.  That information is retained, and whenever possible author/publisher names are provided for series.  Books entirely in languages other than English were removed from the dataset, as the survey specifically asked about books in English.  bilingual books were not removed.  There are , unique entries, , of which are either titles of or references to a single book or a series title.  (Not every respondent listed five books. ) The other thirteen are things like “library book”, “newspaper”, or “custom made book”.  One thousand six hundred and seventeen of the titles are uniquely identifiable, at least in terms of their text.  A small number of the titles in the dataset do not have accompanying author or publisher information.  sometimes their unique identity was clear from the title (e. g.  National Geographic’s Special Dinosaur Issue), or author/publisher information was difficult to discern but its lack did not make the identity of the book unclear (e. g.  Goodnight My Sweet Pea).  Within these , titles, , are also identifiable as to their likely version, while  are not.  Cars Look and Find by Disney, Twas the Night before Christmas, and Baby Beluga.  This is relevant for researchers interested in illustrations rather than / in addition to text.  There are an additional  titles that are not identifiable.  These include very generic titles like “Planes” as well as titles like “Peek-a-boo Elmo.  Puppies” that we could not find a match for.  There are seventy-five series or periodicals listed, many accompanied by author information.  These range from things like “Little Golden books”, which encompasses a range of stories, and “Touch and feel books”, which again covers a number of books by the same publisher but this time united by a theme, to things like “Maisy book series” and “Sandra Boynton books”, where the author is the same for all books in the series, even though the stories differ.  Note that entries are not coded as unidentified or series in the dataset.
