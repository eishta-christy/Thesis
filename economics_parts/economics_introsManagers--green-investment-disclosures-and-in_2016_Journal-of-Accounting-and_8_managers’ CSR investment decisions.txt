 Introduction Although not required, most large companies now issue reports on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. 1 This voluntary disclosure of CSR activities is likely driven at least in part by a desire to communicate CSR information to investors.  If CSR activities affect the company’s future earnings and cash ﬂows, investors will ﬁnd related disclosures useful for their valuation decisions.  However, it is possible that investors react to CSR disclosures for another reason as well.  If investors value the societal beneﬁts associated with CSR activities, they may respond positively to disclosures that the company has engaged in such activities independent of how they expect the activities to affect future earnings and cash ﬂows.  We conduct an experiment to test whether investors respond to managers’ disclosure of their CSR investment independent of the effect on the company’s future cash ﬂows.  In addition, we examine whether managers anticipate investors’ response when making their disclosure decisions.  Finally, we examine whether managers’ CSR investment decisions are driven only by investors’ expected response or also by their preferences for the societal beneﬁts associated with their CSR investments.  Understanding how investors’ respond to CSR disclosure is important because this can help explain managers’ voluntary CSR disclosure practices.
