 Accounting covenants are widely used in private lending agreements to mitigate conﬂicts of interest between shareholders and lenders.  These covenants increase contracting eﬃciency by providing the basis for the optimal allocation of control  rights when contracts are incomplete ( Watts and Zimmerman, 1986.  Roberts and Suﬁ, 2009a.  Christensen and Nikolaev,  1 Auditors are required to check borrowers’ compliance with covenants in private lending  2012.  Christensen et al. , 2016 ).   agreements under GAAP.  In particular, accounting and auditing standards require auditors to conﬁrm the going concern assumption and to ensure the appropriate classiﬁcation of debt as current or non-current, which entails checking covenant  compliance.  In addition to these standard obligations to verify compliance, however, auditors may offer a letter providing  speciﬁc negative assurance directly to lenders by certifying that they have no knowledge of any default.  What is unclear  is whether this additional covenant compliance assurance occurs at random, or whether it can be explained by eﬃcient  contracting.  To date, the literature has been largely silent on the conditions under which lenders seek such assurance from  auditors.
