 1.  Introduction A long strand of literature suggests the great importance of commodities' predictive power to stock market, in which few, if any, other commodities have received more attention for their perceived economic signiﬁcance than oil.  Theoretically and empirically, the critical role of oil market for understanding macroeconomic ﬂuctuations has been well documented (see, for example, Hamilton, 1983, 2005.  Backus and Crucini, 2000.  Kilian and Park, 2009.  Bodenstein etal. , 2011.  Alquist etal. , forthcoming).  Among various oil market variables, oil shock is a noteworthy one as there are voluminous studies, for instance, on the short and long-runco-movements and causation relationships between oil shocks and stock volatility (see, e. g. ,Arouri etal. , 2011, 2012.  Creti etal. , 2013.  Conrad etal. , 2014.  Du and He, 2015.  Kang etal. , 2015.  Ewing and Malik, 2016).  It is, therefore, of interest to deeply investigate the effect of oil market volatility on stock markets.  However, not much has been done on the subject of predictive ability of oil to stock volatility from an out-of-sample perspective.  Existing researches are largely, almost all, based merely on in-sample empirical work.  Admittedly, it is more of reason to employ an out-ofsampleapproach in the sense of prediction although in-sample results appear for reference and comparison (see, e. g. ,Campbell and Thompson, 2005.  Rapach etal. , 2010).  Therefore, in this paper, we investigatewhether the oil volatility risk is useful in explaining the future volatility of international stock market returns.  In particular, our forecasting exercise using a recursive out-of-sample test, confirms that oil volatility risk does exhibit statistically and economically significant and robust in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting power, clearly exceeding some of well-known macroeconomic variables.
