 
Investors, preparers, regulators, and standard setters have expressed concern that corporate disclosure has become longer, 
more redundant, less readable, less speciﬁc, and more boilerplate over time ( Li, 2008; KPMG, 2011; SEC, 2013 ).  In 2013, the 
SEC began a comprehensive review of regulation with the intent of identifying excessive, unduly complex, and redundant 
disclosure ( SEC, 2013 ).  Similarly, the FASB has an ongoing agenda project, the Disclosure Framework, evaluating the effectiveness of textual disclosure ( FASB, 2012 ).  A variety of explanations have been offered for why disclosure might be changing 
over time including increases in litigation concerns, business complexity, globalization, regulation, and new mandatory disclosures ( KPMG, 2011; SEC, 2013; Monga and Chasan, 2015 ).  In this paper we quantify a variety of 10-K disclosure attributes 
and provide initial descriptive evidence on trends in these attributes over time.  
While there is a substantial academic literature on trends in the characteristics of quantitative accounting data (particuthe magnitude, economic determinants, speciﬁc content, and attributes of trends 
larly earnings and book value) over time, 
in textual disclosure have received less attention.  At least in part, this likely reﬂects the challenge in assessing the content 
of 10-K textual disclosure and in categorizing and quantifying disclosure for a large number of lengthy, complex documents, 
especially given that disclosure of a given topic often appears in multiple sections of the 10-K and any given passage often 
combines multiple topics.  
In many ways, the issues in assessing 10-K content are similar to those faced in other literatures.  For example, researchers 
in journalism have been interested in trends in coverage of the New York Times ( Blei, 2012 ), those in literature in understanding topical trends in poetry ( Rhody, 2012 ), in politics understanding trends in Senate discourse ( Grimmer, 2010 ), in 
history understanding historical trends using the content of State Department cables ( Chaney Name, 2015 ), and in science 
understanding topical trends in journals such as Science ( Blei and Lafferty, 2007 ).  In all of these domains, the challenge is 
in analyzing trends in corpuses far too large for humans to manually review and to summarize them in a way that is easily 
interpretable.  
Following that literature, we use a natural language processing technique, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to understand the changing content of 10-Ks.  3 LDA is a Bayesian computational linguistic technique that identifies the latent topics in a corpus of documents.  4 It is well suited to understanding the text of the 10-K because it permits analysis of the topical content of a large group of lengthy documents over time in an objective and replicable matter and relies on a very limited set of assumptions that are likely to be met in 10-K disclosure.  Further, it is specifically designed to infer proportions of content for documents which contain multiple topics, even if the topics are entangled, which is important given that 10-Ks comprise a large number of interspersed topics.  5 It permits the proportion of the 10-K related to each topic to vary across documents so it is well-suited to examining topical trends in textual disclosure.  As a result, we can deconstruct the 10-K by topic irrespective of whether topics appear in, for example, the footnotes, risk factors, or Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A).  We can then assess trends in the discussion of topics over time and relate them to changes in specific disclosure requirements (e. g. , new FASB standards, SEC requirements, and regulatory events such as SOX) and other events (e. g. , changes in litigation risk, mergers and acquisitions, etc. ). 
Additionally, once the topic model is trained, it permits us to identify paragraphs by topic, so that we can track where 
speciﬁc topics occur within the 10-K.  This allows us to identify the extent to which, for example, FASB requirements (e. g. , 
footnotes) create redundancy with SEC requirements (e. g. , risk factors and MD&A) by highlighting which topics tend to 
be redundant within the 10-K as well as across time and across ﬁrms.  Similarly, by accumulating text within a topic, we 
can identify the topical sources of textual attributes that prior literature suggests may be important such as boilerplate, 
redundancy, stickiness, and lack of speciﬁcity.  
In our empirical analysis, we examine the text of 10-Ks for 10,452 ﬁrms and 75,991 ﬁrm-years over the period 1996 
to 2013.  We begin by documenting trends in textual characteristics that have been identiﬁed by prior research as potentially affecting the informativeness of disclosure, including length ( Loughran and McDonald, 2014 ), readability ( Miller, 2010 ), 
boilerplate ( Lang and Stice-Lawrence, 2015 ), redundancy ( Cazier and Pfeiffer, 2015b ), speciﬁcity ( Hope Name, 2016 ), stickiness  ( Brown  and  Tucker,  2011 ),  and  the  relative  prevalence  of  informative  numbers  in  the  text  or  “hard” information 
( Blankespoor, 2016 ).  
We document clear and consistent trends across all measures.  Median text length doubled from 23,0 0 0 words in 1996 to 
nearly 50,0 0 0 in 2013, while redundancy, boilerplate, and stickiness increased nearly monotonically and readability, speciﬁcity, and the relative mix of hard information showed clear decreases.  Given these trends, we next investigate their topical 
sources.
