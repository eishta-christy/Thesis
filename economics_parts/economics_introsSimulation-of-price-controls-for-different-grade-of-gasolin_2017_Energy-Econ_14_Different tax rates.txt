 1.  Introduction The essence of the gasoline subsidy policy problem is its inefﬁciency.  The policy leads to overconsumption of gasoline since a subsidy drives consumers to purchase a good at a price that is cheaper than the cost of producing it (Harvey and Gayer, 2013).  Overconsumption also leads to negative externalities such as emission of local pollutants, trafﬁc congestions and accidents (Davis, 2014).  In the case of Indonesia, the problem is further aggravated by the fact that the government only provides a subsidy for regular gasoline, the lowest grade gasoline.  Malaysia and Egypt implemented a similar policy that only deregulates the higher grade of gasoline (Kojima, 2013).  Indonesia started off in the 1960s with only the national oil company, Pertamina, allowed in the domestic gasoline market.  There was only one grade of gasoline, and it was subsidized in the form of underpricing as the price was signiﬁcantly lower than the world market price.  Gasoline was subsidized as a way to protect people from the effects of inﬂation (Beaton and Lonton, 2010).  In 2001, a new regulation was introduced by the government that opened up the domestic gasoline market to multinational oil companies but only for high-octane gasoline.  This was done to combat the 1997 Asian ﬁnancial crisis.  Regular gasoline was left subsidized.  Such a scheme violates Ramsey's tax rule that taxing rival commodities should leave the consumer's relative choices unaltered (Ramsey, 1927).  Different tax rates on commodities and factors introduce a distortion between the marginal rate of substitution and the marginal rate of transformation (Stiglitz and Dasgupta, 1971).  In addition, Ito and Sallee (2014) found that taxation based on different characteristics of automobiles caused distortions in that market.
