 1.  Introduction In recent years, climate change has aroused worldwide attention, and in-depth international discussions have been held to mitigate climate change.  Since 2007, China has surpassed the US to become the world's largest CO2 emitter, and thus becomes a focus of global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.  As one of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, China has always been promoting the implementation of the Convention and fulﬁlling its obligations.  Chinese government committed to reduce CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic production (GDP) by 40–45% towards 2020 at 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Conference and by 60–65% towards 2030 at 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference.  To achieve such challenging emission-reduction targets, China has attempted to adopt effective policy instruments, such as the deployment of renewable energy, the establishment of national carbon emission trading market.  China has experienced a signiﬁcant increase in CO2 emissions in the past decades (Liu et al. , 2015).  Large variations in the growth pattern of China's CO2 emissions at the regional level exist due to uneven distribution of initial resource endowment, economic scale, industry structure, development stage etc.  (Meng et al. , 2016).  CO2 emissions per capita and CO2 emissions per unit of GDP among China's 30 regions also vary sharply (Shan et al. , 2016).  Emission-reduction targets for each region should be set in considering the characteristics of socio-economic development (Wang et al. , 2016).  Therefore, it is necessary to explore the driving forces of the variations of national and regional CO2 emissions of China in order to set accurate emission-reduction targets and take effective measures from the perspective of national and regionalThis study explores the changes of national and regional CO2 emissions using temporal decomposition analysis model, and analyzes the differences of CO2 emissions between China's 30 regions and the national average using spatial decomposition analysis model.  In addition, this study evaluates the potential of emission-reduction of China's 30 regions.  The study did not only contribute to the energy saving and emission reduction of China's CO2 emissions but also provide some targeted suggestion for emission-reduction at regional and sectoralThe remainder of this study is organized as follows.  Section 2 reviews some existing literature.  Section 3 presents the models including temporal and spatial decomposition analysis models and data sources used in this study, and the overview of the national and regional CO2 emissions in China.  Section 4 depicts the decomposition results and evaluates the potential of emission-reduction in China's 30 regions.  Section 5 details further discussion of the deep-rooted reasons of key factors with larger effect on CO2 emissions and the future tendency of contribution of key factors.  Section 6 shows conclusion of the analysis, with summary and policy implications.  2.  Literature review.  Existing studies have been conducted to analyze the driving forces of the variations of national and regional CO2 emissions from the perspective of temporal and spatial level.  First, tracking changes of CO2 emissions and quantifying the driving forces of the changes over time have long been a focus area of researchers and policymakers.  Intensive studies have analyzed the CO2 emissions and the driving forces of the change of CO2 emissions at national (Wu et al. , 2005.  Jung et al. , 2012.  Cortés-Borda et al. , 2015.  Sumabat et al. , 2016.  van Ruijven et al. , 2016), regional (Liang et al. , 2007.  Geng et al. , 2013.  Wang et al. , 2017) and industrial level (Lin and Moubarak, 2013.  Xu and Lin, 2016a.  Talbi, 2017) overSecond, growing interest among researchers in comparing regions in terms of CO2 emissions emerges in recent years.  The comparison allows variations among countries or regions to be revealed, the contributing factors identiﬁed, and the scope for improvement better understood (Ang et al. , 2016).  Many studies on analyzing the differences in CO2 emissions among different countries (Sun, 2000a, 2000b.  Zhang and Ang, 2001.  Bataille et al. , 2007), regions (Feng et al. , 2009.  Su and Ang, 2016.  Xu and Lin, 2016b.  Wang et al. , 2016.  Xu et al. , 2016), and a speciﬁc sector among regions (Cui and Li, 2015.  Xu and Lin, 2016a, 2016c.  Long et al. , 2016) have also been conducted.  Besides, some studies are also involved in the spatio-temporal analysis on the differences in regional CO2 emissions in recent years (Huang and Meng, 2013.  Kim and Dall'erba, 2014.  Chen and Yang, 2015.  Ang et al. , 2016).  Existing literatures on the spatial analysis mainly focus on the differences in CO2 emissions among regions from the perspective of production or a speciﬁc production sector, and less literature are involved in householdDecomposition analysis is usually used to analyze the variations in energy usage and emissions (Ang, 2015).  The model can not only identify the main driving forces of the variations in an aggregation but also show the clearly quantitative results of to what extent the driving forces affect the variations (Su and Ang, 2012, 2015).  The logistics mean Division index (LMDI) model is a preferred index decomposition analysis approach because of the advantages of path independence, residue free, ability to handle zero values, and consistency in aggregation (Ang, 2004).  Previous studies mainly adopted LMDI model to study the determinants of variations of an aggregate based on the data collected chronologically at different points in time for a speciﬁc region, such as Ang and Liu (2001), Wang et al.  (2005), Mairet and Decellas (2009), Wang and Li (2016), Shao et al.  (2016), Lin and Ahmad (2017).  Therefore, this study uses LMDI method to conduct a temporal decomposition analysis of the changes of national and regional CO2 emissions of China.  Ang et al.  (2015) proposed a multi-regional (M-R) spatial decomposition model, which can be used to analyze why the differences in CO2 emissions exist among countries or among different regions within a country.  The model shows an advantage in reducing decomposition cases, avoiding subjectivity in benchmark region selection, maintaining the property of circularity, and providing valuable information in terms of the potential of energy-saving and emission-reduction.  Therefore, this study adopts the M-R spatial decomposition model to compare the CO2 emission performance of China's 30 regions.  This study explores the driving forces of the changes of national and regional CO2 emissions using LMDI model, and investigates the driving forces of the differences of CO2 emissions between China's 30 regions and the national average using multi-regional M-R spatial decomposition analysis model.  Compared with the existing studies, the main contributions of this study are as follows.  (1) We carry out an in-depth analysis to uncover the main driving forces of the changes of national and regional CO2 emissions in China, and to analyze the dominant driving forces of the differences in CO2 emissions among China's 30 regions.  The study provides deep insights into why and what degree the key factors affect national and regional CO2 emissions of China from the perspective of temporal and spatial dimensions, and offers policymakers references to formulate and implement targeted mitigation policies at both national and regional level.  (2) The original M-R spatial decomposition analysis model is improved in this study.  On one hand, household sector is introduced into the M-R spatial decomposition model for the ﬁrst time, and thus this study quantiﬁes the effects of urbanization, income improvement and population.  On the other hand, economic output and economic structure are introduced into the model in aspect of production sector.  The improved temporal and spatial decomposition analysis models in this study can be employed to analyze the variation of an aggregation, such as energy, water, waste, pollutants etc. , from the perspective of both production sector and household sector.  <Middle> Modelology and data.  3. 1.  Decomposition model.  3. 1. 1.  Kaya identity.  In the decomposition analysis framework, energy-related CO2 emissions are classiﬁed into two categories according to emission sources.  energy-related CO2 emissions from production sector and energy-related CO2 emissions from household sector.  National and regional CO2 emissions in China can be decomposed into nine kinds of driving forces, as shown in Eq.  (1).  Where, i denotes each region in China.  j denotes the sectors involved in this study (j=1,2,⋯,6 for agriculture, industry, construction, service, urban residents and rural residents).  k denotes the energy type consumed by each sector (k= 1, 2,⋯,12 for raw coal, coke, crude oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, LPG, reﬁnery gas, other petroleum products, natural gas and electricity).  The variables involved in the temporal and spatial decomposition models are deﬁned in Tables 1 and 2.  3. 1. 2.  Temporal decomposition analysis.  Based on additive LMDI model proposed by Ang (2005), the aggregate changes of CO2 emissions for each region of China between the base year 0 and the target year T are decomposed into 9 driving forces, see Eq.  (2), i. e. , carbon intensity effect, energy intensity effect in the production sector, energy intensity effect in the household sector, energy structure effect, industrial structure effect, urbanization effect, economic scale effect, population scale effect and household income improvement effect.  The effects of various driving forces of regional CO2 emissions between the base year 0 and the target year T for region i are calculated using the following equations.  3. 1. 3.  Spatial decomposition analysis.  Spatial decomposition analysis is a popular useful in comparing differences in energy consumption, energy efﬁciency or CO2 emissions among regions within a country in a particular year (Su and Ang, 2016).  This study adopts the M-R spatial decomposition analysis model to analyze the differences of CO2 emissions among different regions in China.  In this spatial decomposition framework, each targeted region is chosen to compare with a reference entity given by the arithmetic average of the entire group.  In this study, China's 30 regions are ranked according to the descending order of the CO2 emissions, and the national average is chosen as the benchmark reference for comparison for each pair.  The differences of CO2 emissions between the regions i and the national average (∗), denoted as ΔCtot (Ri−R∗), can be decomposed to give.  Notably, carbon emission factors are constant for different fossil energy, and carbon intensity effect including ΔCi, CIare always zero in the decomposition analysis.  Therefore, this study considers the effects of other eight kinds of driving forces of national and regional CO2 emissions in the following analysis.  3. 2.  Data source, processing and variables.  The study period is from 2000 to 2015, and is divided into 4 subperiods, i. e. , 2000–2005, 2006–2008, 2009–2012 and 2013–20,015 in the temporal decomposition analysis.  The spatial scale includes China's 30 regions, which consists of 30 provinces and municipalities in mainland3. 2. 1.  Energy consumption (E) and CO2 emissions (C).  The data for energy consumption and CO2 emissions of each region in mainland China are derived from China Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs). 2 National energy consumption and CO2 emissions are the aggregation of China's 30 regional to ensure data consistency.  The data for national and regional energy consumption are from Energy Inventories for China and its 30 regions and cities in CEADs (Seen Table A. 1).  The amount of energy consumption is measured by million tons of standard coal equivalent (Mtce).  Twelve types of energy resource are included in this study, i. e. , raw coal, coke, crude oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, LPG, reﬁnery gas, other petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. 3 CEADs also publishes the latest CO2 emission inventories for China and its 30 regions and cities, and two approaches are used to calculate the CO2 emissions.  apparent emission accounting approach and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sectoral approach.  In this study, the data for CO2 emissions of each region are from emission inventories by IPCC sectoral approach.  CO2 emissions for fossil fuel consumption and for industrial processes by IPCC sectoral approach are calculated based on Energy consumption data and Emission factors, seen Eqs.  (22) and (23).  Where, CEij represents the CO2 emissions of different sectors and energy ' represents the adjusted energy consumption.  NCVj repretypes.  ADij sents the net caloriﬁc value of different energy types.  EFj refers to the emission factors.  and Oij refers to the oxygenation efﬁciency of different sectors and energy types.  CEt represents the carbon emissions of industrial products, ADt represents output of each industrial product and EFt represents the emission factors for each industrial product.  In addition, this study considers CO2 emissions from both fossil fuel consumption and industrial processes when conducting overview analysis of the national and regional CO2 emissions of China in Section 2, and focuses on CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption in the temporal and spatial decomposition analysis in Section 4.  Energy-related CO2 emissions at national and regional level are shown in Table A. 2.  3. 2. 2.  Variables in socio-economic development.  GDP, value-added of various sectors, disposable income and population in each region used in this study are obtained from China Statistical Yearbook (NBSC, 2000-2015).  The multiple sectors are classiﬁed into two categories.  production sector (i. e. , agriculture, industry, construction, and service sector) and household sector (i. e. , urban and rural household sector) in our decomposition analysis framework.  To study the driving forces of CO2 emissions of China, the variables including energy structure, energy intensity by sector, GDP, industrialization rate, urbanization rate, population, and urban and rural disposable income per capita are chosen in this study. 4 The details are as follows.  3. 2. 2. 1.  Energy intensity.  During 2000–2015, most regions experienced an inverted U-shaped evolution trend in energy intensity.  However, energy intensity in Ningxia showed a continuing increase trend.  In 2015, Ningxia has the highest energy intensity of 273. 56 kg ce/1000 yuan, followed by Shanxi, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, and the energy intensity of industrial sector reached 1034. 28 kg ce/1000 yuan which was much higher than other regions in China.  Energy intensity of Beijing in 2015 is lowest among regions.  Energy intensity by sector of China's 30 regions in 2015 are shown in Table A. 3 in Appendix.  3. 2. 2. 2.  GDP.  The data for GDP and value-added of various sectors from 2000 to 2015 are converted to the 2000 constant price to eliminate the effect of inﬂation.  Compared with that of 2000, China's GDP in 2015 increased by 4. 08 times.  In general, Guangdong has the largest scale of GDP, while Ningxia has the lowest scale of GDP.  During 2000– 2015, average annual growth rate of GDP for each region exceed 10%, in which it reached 14. 79% in Inner Mongolia.  GDP of China's 30 regions are shown in Table A. 4 in Appendix.  3. 2. 2. 3.  Industrialization.  Industrial sector consumes large amount of fossil energy resource, and thus emits large amount of CO2.  Value-added of industrial sector affects CO2 emissions severely.  This study uses industrialization rate, i. e. , the ratio of industrial value-added to total GDP, to measure the change of industrial structure.  Industrialization rate of Heilongjiang and Tianjin are larger than other regions in China, whereas Hainan is the lowest during 2000–2015.  Due to the development of service sector, the share of industrial value-added in most regions declined in recent years.  Industrialization rate of China's 30 regions are shown in Table A. 5 in Appendix.  3. 2. 2. 4.  Urbanization.  Urbanization is the important factor to inﬂuence energy consumption and CO2 emissions because residential income and energy efﬁciency would improve in the process of urbanization.  This study employs the ratio of urban population to total population to measure the level of urbanization.  Generally, urbanization rate of China has been growing from 35. 50% in 2000 to 55. 44% in 2015.  Shanghai and Beijing are the two regions with highest urbanization rate of 88. 62% and 86. 42% in 2015, respectively.  However, urbanization rate in Guizhou remained 41. 01% in 2015.  Urbanization rate of China's 30 regions are shown in Table A. 6 in Appendix.  3. 2. 2. 5.  Population.  Since NBSC provides the data on year-end population in urban and rural area, this study takes the average of population at the beginning and end of the year.  Population in most regions increased slowly during 2000–2015, with an average annual growth rate of 0. 58%.  However, affected by labor transfer, growth rate of population reached 4. 33% in Tianjin, 3. 22% in Beijing and 2. 69% in Shanghai.  Notably, population in Anhui declined during 2000–2015.  Population of China's 30 regions are shown in Table A. 7 in Appendix.  3. 2. 2. 6.  Disposable income per capita.  As income rises, more energy resources are consumed to support the use of electrical appliances, and then more CO2 are emitted.  In this study, disposable income per capita by eliminating inﬂation is used to measure the real level of income.  During 2000–2015, most regions in China showed high-speed increase in disposable income per capita, with an average annual growth rate of 8. 85% in urban region and 8. 56% in rural region.  Shanghai and Beijing are two regions with highest disposable income per capita of both urban and rural residents.  However, Qinghai has lowest urban disposable income per capita and Gansu is the region with lowest rural disposable income per capita.  Urban and rural disposable income per capita of China's 30 regions are shown in Tables A. 8 and A. 9 in Appendix.  3. 3.  Overview of the national and regional CO2 emissions in China.  This section analyzes the performance of China's CO2 emissions at both national and regional levels.  First, the evolution trends of national CO2 emissions in China during 2000–2015 are investigated, and then the whole study period is divided into different time intervals in considering the evolution trends of national CO2 emissions.  Second, CO2 emissions of China's 30 regions and three big regions between 2000 and 2015 are compared.  3. 3. 1.  National CO2 emissions.  There has been a signiﬁcant increase in China's CO2 emissions from 3397. 62 million tons (Mt. ) in 2000 to 9403. 00 Mt.  in 2015 at an average annual growth rate of 7. 02%.  As shown in Fig.  1a, the changes in national CO2 emissions mainly runs through four stages.  high-speed growth stage (2000–2005), decreasing-speed growth stage (2006–2008), steady growth stage (2009–2012) and transition stage (2013–2015).  During 2000–2005, growth rate of national CO2 emissions increased from 4. 32% to 16. 90%, and national CO2 emissions showed a sharp increase, which was deﬁned as high-speed growth stage.  However, growth rate of national CO2 emissions declined signiﬁcantly from 2006 to 2008, and the time interval can be deﬁned as the decreasingspeed growth stage.  China experienced a steady increase in CO2 emissions during 2009–2012, and the growth rate remained between 5. 76% and 6. 65%, which was deﬁned as the steady growth stage.  During 2013–2015, growth rate of national CO2 emissions declined, and even became the negative value of −0. 87% in 2014 and −4. 09% in 2015.  This special stage was deﬁned as the transition stage, and was attributed to the transformation of economic development patterns.  In short, this division of growth stage helps to understand the evolution trends of national CO2 emissions, and also is the basis of conducting the temporal and spatial decomposition analysis of national and regional CO2 emissions in this study.  Share of CO2 emissions from fossil energy consumption or process remained largely unchanged during 2000–2015 (Fig.  1b).  During the whole study period, coal-related CO2 emissions accounted for a substantial part of 74. 50%–79. 50% in national CO2 emissions.  The high share of coal-related CO2 emissions was ascribed to the abundant coal resource reserve, coal-dominated energy structure and power structure in China (Ouyang and Lin, 2015.  Zhang et al. , 2016).  Share of oil-related CO2 emissions declined from 17. 63% to 11. 19% during 2000–2011, and rebounded during 2011–2015.  Share of CO2 emissions from industrial production process in national CO2 emissions were relatively small.  In general, gas-related CO2 emissions experienced an upward trend, in which CO2 emissions from the combustion of natural gas climbed from 1. 30% to 3. 22% during 2000–2015.  Fig.  1c shows the national CO2 emissions from different sectors during 2000–2015.  CO2 emissions in the power sector and manufacturing sector accounted for approximately 40% of national CO2 emissions, respectively, which were the two largest industrial CO2 emitters.  Transport sector was the third largest industrial CO2 emitter, and its share in national CO2 emissions ﬂuctuated slightly between 6. 00%–6. 82% during 2000–2015.  Share of CO2 emissions from urban residents showed a decline trend from 4. 24% in 2000 to 2. 20% 2015.  However, share of CO2 emissions from rural residents experienced an inverted U-shaped growth trend, increasing from 1. 52% in 2000 to 2. 96% in 2003 and declining to 1. 78% in 2015.  Except for a few years, share of CO2 emissions from urban residents were higher than that of rural residents during 2000–2015.  3. 3. 2.  Regional CO2 emissions.  CO2 emissions among China's 30 regions varied signiﬁcantly, seen in Fig.  2.  The top ten regions in term of CO2 emissions include Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Inner Mongolia, Henan, Liaoning, Shanxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Hubei.  Sum of CO2 emissions in these ten regions, on average, accounted for 58. 65% of national CO2 emissions during 2000– 2015.  Shandong province contributed most of 8. 75% to national CO2 emissions accumulatively during 2000–2015, followed by Hebei (7. 82%) and Jiangsu (6. 93%).  Energy-related CO2 emissions of some regions in China exceeded national energy-related CO2 emissions of some developed countries.  For example, CO2 emissions in Shandong (742. 32 Mt. ), Hebei (720. 77 Mt. ) and Jiangsu (647. 87 Mt. ) provinces in 2014 were higher than that of Canada (554. 80 Mt. ) and Australia (373. 80 Mt. ).  However, CO2 emissions in some regions, such as Qinghai and Hainan, accounted for a small part of less than 0. 5% in national CO2 emissions.  Such a big difference in CO2 emissions among regions lies in different socio-economic development condition, i. e. , the levels of economic development, industrialization, urbanization, population, and energy resources endowment.  Regions, such as Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Zhejiang emitted large amount of CO2 emissions, which were mainly attributed the high level of economic output, industrialization and urbanization.  Some regions, such as Inner Mongolia and Shanxi were less developed, but consumed massive fossil energy resource and induced large amount of CO2 emissions in developing the economy.  That was largely because these regions were abundant in energy resource and thus develop resource-based industrial structure.  In addition, CO2 emissions in Hebei and Henan provinces also accounted for a large proportion of national CO2 emissions because of the higher level of economic output and population.  A comparison of regional CO2 emissions in 2000 and in 2015 indicates that, CO2 emissions in most regions experienced a sharp increase during 2000–2015.  After China's joining into World Trade Organization, national and regional economy developed rapidly, and industrialization and urbanization were increasingly deepening.  Consequently, huge amount of fossil energy resource were consumed to support the rapid economic development, and induced massive CO2 emissions of the regions.  Resource-based regions showed most signiﬁcant increase in CO2 emissions during 2000–2015.  CO2 emissions in Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Xinjiang increased from 105. 95 Mt. , 58. 91 Mt.  and 65. 38 Mt.  in 2000 to 585. 71 Mt. , 272. 83 Mt.  and 243. 94 Mt.  in 2015, and corresponding average annual growth rate reached 12. 07%, 10. 76% and 9. 17%, respectively.  Coal-dominated energy structure and rapid development of resource-based industry drove to rapid increase in energy consumption and CO2 emissions of resource-based regions.  CO2 emissions in Hainan, Fujian and Shandong also increased considerably during 2000–2015.  In contrast, CO2 emissions increased slowly in most developed regions like Beijing, Shanghai and Taiwan, and the average annual growth rate of CO2 emissions in these regions during 2000–2015 were below 3. 50%.  On one hand, the developed regions had come into the post-industrial stage, and modern service industry was the primary engine of economic development.  On the other hand, large decline in coal consumption occurred in Beijing and Shanghai due to the transformation of energy development patterns and the adjustment of energy structure (Xu et al. , 2016).  When China's 30 regions are regrouped into three big regions, i. e. , eastern region, central region and western region, CO2 emissions at the three regions are also investigated.  The eastern region contributed most of 48. 96% to national CO2 emissions during 2000–2015, followed by central region of 33. 44% and western region of 17. 60%.  Provinces with larger CO2 emissions are mainly located in eastern region while provinces with lower CO2 emissions were largely in western region.  However, differences in CO2 emissions per capita among three big regions are relatively small, and the differences between eastern region and western region, eastern region and central region dropped from 32. 04% and 12. 47% in 2000 to 20. 32% and 5. 45% in 2015, respectively.  Considering the great differences in CO2 emissions among regions, Chinses government should pay more attention to regional CO2 emissions, and thus formulate differentiated emission-reduction policies at regional level in order to reduce China's CO2 emissions sharply.  4.  Results.  4. 1.  Temporal decomposition analysis.  The temporal decomposition analysis model is employed to analyze the underlying driving forces of national and regional energy-related CO2 emissions during 2000–2015.  This section decomposes the changes of CO2 emissions of each time interval (i. e. , 2000–2005, 2006–2008, 2009–2012 and 2013–20,015) to explore the main driving forces and discover the reasons behind of the changes.  4. 1. 1.  Temporal decomposition results of national CO2 emissions.  During 2000–2015, national energy-related CO2 emissions increased by 5828. 62 Mt. , a growth rate of 201. 67%.  The temporal decomposition results (see Table 3) revealed that economic scale effect (ΔC_A) was the dominant driving force that leads to the increase in national CO2 emissions while energy intensity effect in the production sector (ΔC_EGI) and energy structure effect (ΔC_ES) were the main factors to reduce national CO2 emissions, which was in line with an array of previous studies, such as S.  Xu et al.  (2014), X.  Xu et al.  (2014), Zhang and Da (2015), Wang et al.  (2015), Wang and Chao (2017).  Accumulative contribution of ΔC_A reached 9195. 62 Mt.  which accounted for 157. 77% of the change of national CO2 emissions, and contribution of ΔC_EGI and ΔC_ES were −4098. 44 Mt.  and − 1357. 73 Mt.  which accounted for −70. 32% and −23. 29% of the change of national CO2 emissions, respectively.  During 2000–2015, China's GDP increased by 3. 08 times, and massive energy were consumed to support it which induced large amount of CO2 emissions.  However, energy intensity decreased signiﬁcantly from 91. 73 kg ce/1000 yuan in 2000 to 58. 09 kg ce/1000 yuan in 2015, a growth rate of −36. 67%, which was mainly attributed to technology progress, capital-energy substitution and government polices (such as the phase-out and retirement of small-scale thermal power units and the elimination of backward production capacity) (Lin and Du, 2014.  Yang and Lin, 2016).  In addition, China has implemented strong policies to encourage gas to replace coal consumption in the industry and household sectors, and has used substantial subsidies to stimulate the deployment of non-fossil energy (Yang et al. , 2014.  Qi et al. , 2016).  During 2000–2015, the share of natural gas and renewable energy in energy consumption increased from 2. 20%, 73. 0% to 5. 90%, and 12. 00%, respectively, and the coal share decreased from 68. 50% to 64. 00% (CNBS).  The signiﬁcant improvement of energy structure in China in the past decades played an important role in restricting the increase in national CO2 emissions.  Industrial structure effect (ΔC_S), population scale effect (ΔC_P) and income improvement effect (ΔC_Y) were responsible for the increase in national CO2 emissions, and the corresponding proportion in the national CO2 emission change during 2000–2015 were 21. 51% (1253. 45 Mt. ), 10. 87% (633. 40 Mt. ) and 6. 48% (377. 60 Mt. ), respectively.  The improvement of disposal income and living standards in the household sector increased fossil energy consumption for cooking, warming and transportation.  During 2000–2015, energy consumption in the household sector increased by 2. 00 times, leading to the rapid increase in CO2 emissions.  Energy intensity effect in the household sector (ΔC_EYI) contributed to the reduction of national CO2 emissions, accounting for −3. 30% of the change of national CO2 emissions.  This result was supported by Dai et al.  (2012) and Qi et al.  (2016), because the spending on necessities (including energy) decreased with the growth of income.  While urbanization effect increased national CO2 emissions, accounting for 0. 30% of the change of national CO2 emissions.  The urbanization process promoted CO2 emissions by infrastructure construction, the development of industrial and transport sectors, population aggregation and the increasing residential energy consumption due to rural-to-urban migration (Li et al. , 2011.  Zi et al. , 2016.  Ouyang and Lin, 2015).  However, the two effects of the improvement of both energy intensity and of the urbanization played minor roles in the change of national CO2 emissions during 2000–2015.  During 2000–2005, 2006–2008 and 2009–2012, China has experienced the rapid growth of CO2 emissions, and the increase in CO2 emissions were 2372. 67 Mt. , 1544. 43 Mt. , and 2053. 92 Mt. , respectively.  In contrast, CO2 emissions of China decreased during 2013–2015, which was mainly attributed to the transition of economic development accompanying with the decrease in economic growth rate, signiﬁcant improvement of energy efﬁciency and major adjustment of energy structure.  Energy utilization efﬁciency in China was greatly improved during 2008–2015, and average annual contribution of energy intensity effect including ΔC_EGI and ΔC_EYI increased signiﬁcantly from −360. 62 Mt.  during 2009–2012 to −539. 78 Mt.  during 2013–2015.  The Chinese government took a series of measures to improve the energy utilization efﬁciency after 2005, including improving the energy efﬁciency standards and discouraging small energy-inefﬁcient units in the power plants, establishing fuel consumption limits, implementing vehicle emissions standards in the transport sector, establishing energy-efﬁcient design standards for commercial buildings in the service sector (Zhou et al. , 2010, 2014.  S.  Xu et al. , 2014.  X.  Xu et al. , 2014).  However, the average annual contribution of ΔC_A reduced from 838. 25 Mt.  during 2009– 2012 to 537. 53 Mt.  during 2013–2015.  Contributions of various driving forces showed an inverted-U shaped growth trend during the four time interval, and the properties of each driving factor remained unchanged except for industrial structure effect.  China was entering the postindustrial period along with decreasing share of industrial value-added and increasing share of value-added in service sector, ΔC_S turned from a positive driving force during the ﬁrst three sub-periods to a negative one (−84. 31 Mt. ) during 2013–2015.  4. 1. 2.  Temporal decomposition results of regional CO2 emissions.  Based on the temporal decomposition analysis model, CO2 emissions for each region are decomposed to reveal the main driving forces of the changes of regional CO2 emissions.  Accumulative contributions of various driving forces of CO2 emissions for each region are provided in Fig.
