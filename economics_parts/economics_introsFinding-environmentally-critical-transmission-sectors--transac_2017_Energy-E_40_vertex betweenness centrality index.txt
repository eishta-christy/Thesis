 1.  Introduction Environmentally extended input-output analysis has been widely used to estimate production- and consumption-based emissions in many countries (Peters, 2008.  Hertwich and Peters, 2009.  IPCC, 2014), and in Japan a national emission inventory has been provided to the public every ﬁve years (NIES, 2016).  A major advantage of using environmental energy input-output analysis is that product supply-chain networks can be easily modelled and environmentally and ecologically important sectors and paths can be identiﬁed from the network (Lenzen, 2003.  Lenzen et al. , 2012.  Wood and Lenzen, 2009.  Oshita, 2012).  Clustering analysis has also been applied to environmental energy input-output analysis in order to ﬁnd environmentally important industry groups (i. e. , industry clusters) that induce higher CO2 emissions along their supply-chains (Kagawa et al. , 2013a, 2013b, 2015).  It is important to note that the environmentally critical sectors, transactions, paths, and clusters identiﬁed by input-output analysis play important roles in reducing consumption-based emissions through the entire economy.  A supply-chain path is composed of transactions between two sectors.  An environmentally critical sector as identiﬁed by key sector analysis (Rasmussen, 1956.  Hirschman, 1958.  Hazari, 1970.  Lenzen, 2003) is considered to be a sector that contributes to emitting larger environmental emissions (e. g. , CO2 emissions) in the economy through not only purchasing emission- and energy-intensive products from other upstream sectors but producing emission- and energy-intensive products in its own sector.  Therefore, an effective emission reduction policy (i. e. , technology policy) is to improve the production technology of the critical sector toward a cleaner one that has less energy consumption and environmental emissions along the product supply chain.  Information on environmentally critical paths (Lenzen, 2003) and clusters (Kagawa et al. , 2013a, 2013b, 2015.  Rifki et al. , 2017) can support a technology policy in the sense that policymakers can ﬁnd highpriority supply-chain paths (i. e. , upstream products) and clusters (i. e. , upstream product systems).  However, it is not an easy task to ﬁnd high-priority paths and clusters from the supply-chain complexity due to the problem of computation (e. g. , Kagawa et al. , 2015).  Liang et al.  (2016) proposed a useful indicator, vertex betweenness centrality, of a speciﬁc sector by combining input-output analysis with social network analysis.  More speciﬁcally, Liang et al.  (2016) formulated the vertex betweenness centrality index by applying the notion of network centrality (Freeman, 1977, 1978.  Freeman et al.
