Within the 1997 United Nations Watercourses Convention it is stated
that riparian states “may, where necessary, consider” harmonizing their
existing agreements with the principles of the convention, thus leaving
the decision whether or not to reevaluate past agreements essentially
up to riparian states (UN, 2014.  Article 3).  Yet, scholars have emphasized
that reevaluation of past agreements is rather a necessity due to pressing
economic and development needs, as well as new international agendas
(Wegerich and Olsson, 2010.  Brooks Name, 2013.  Salman, 2014.  Wouters,
2014).  Similarly, calls for reevaluation of water-sharing agreements have
been voiced in connection with growing environmental concerns and
climate change (Sanchez and Roberts, 2014.  World Economic Forum,
2015).  While there are large-scale studies on how treaties could be designed for coping best with new challenges and what mechanisms are
utilized within agreements to address changes (e. g. , Fischhendler,
2004.  Stefano Name, 2010.  Drieschova Name, 2011.  De Bruyne and
Fischhendler, 2013), there have been only a few studies systematically
showing changes in agreements due to paths taken (Pak Name, 2014. 
Soliev Name, 2015).  Adapting from the conﬂict and cooperation
continuum approach on international basins (Yoffe Name, 2003.  Zeitoun
and Mirumachi, 2008.
