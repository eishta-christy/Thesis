 1.  Introduction.  All auditors (US and foreign) who audit US-listed companies are required to register with the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board (PCAOB) and be subject to PCAOB inspections.  In this study, we focus on foreign auditors and consider  whether audit quality for non -US-listed foreign public clients (non-US-listed clients) is higher following the initial PCAOB inspection.  Our study addresses the issue of positive externality, i. e. , whether the PCAOB international inspection program  improves audit quality for foreign auditors’ non-US-listed foreign clients even though investors in these particular foreign  companies are not the intended beneﬁciaries of the foreign auditor inspection program The impact of the PCAOB international inspection program on audit quality abroad is ambiguous.  Given the PCAOB’s  reputation for actively looking for auditor misconduct and taking follow-up disciplinary actions against deﬁcient auditors  ( DeFond, 2010.  Farrell and Shabad, 2005 ), the very act of registering with the PCAOB may exacerbate foreign auditors’ exposure to reputation loss and provide them with an ex ante incentive to strengthen their ﬁrm -level quality controls and  increase audit quality.  To the extent that audit deﬁciencies are discovered during the initial inspection, the auditor may  have an additional incentive to take appropriate remedial action and strengthen ﬁrm-level quality controls to avoid further  embarrassment on subsequent inspections.  The improvements in the foreign auditor’s ﬁrm -level quality controls could increase audit quality for all of the ﬁrm’s foreign clients US-listed or otherwise.  Moreover, because the starting point for audit  quality is potentially lower abroad than in the US ( Choi et al. , 2008.  Francis and Wang, 2008 ), the PCAOB inspection program  could have a greater impact abroad than in the US.   However, reasons exist to doubt the eﬃcacy of PCAOB inspections in improving audit quality.  Prior research ( DeFond,  2010.  Lennox and Pittman, 2010 ) indicates that PCAOB inspection reports are not useful for assessing audit quality because  they merely list audit deﬁciencies and do not provide a summary opinion about the auditor’s quality.  Moreover, the effectiveness of the PCAOB’s international inspections may be limited by geographic distance from the US, potential language  differences, or cultural barriers.  Finally, foreign auditors may follow an asymmetric approach to their US-listed and nonUS-listed clients.  Given that the PCAOB is primarily interested in protecting investors in US-listed companies (selecting only  US-listed client engagements for inspection) and the fact that auditor litigation exposure is lower for non-US-listed clients  than for US-listed clients, foreign auditors may be less incentivized to improve audit quality for their non-US-listed clients.   Foreign auditors may override their ﬁrm-level quality controls and utilize less effective audit programs or assemble less  qualiﬁed audit teams for their non-US-listed clients (which may be less costly).  To the extent that foreign auditors follow  an asymmetric approach in servicing their US-listed and non-US-listed clients, any PCAOB inspection-related improvements  in ﬁrm-level quality controls may not necessarily beneﬁt their non-US-listed audit clients.  For all these reasons, the overall  effectiveness of the PCAOB international inspection program in improving audit quality for foreign auditors’ non-US-listed  clients is far from obvious and remains an open empirical question.   Because the quality of ﬁnancial reporting is a joint outcome of manager and auditor decision making, audit quality is  best viewed as a continuum with higher audit quality providing greater assurance of ﬁnancial reporting quality ( DeFond and  Zhang, 2014 ).  Still, beyond the notion that better audit quality leads to better ﬁnancial reporting quality, little or no consensus emerges in the extant literature as to how best to measure audit quality.
