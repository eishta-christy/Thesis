Environmentally extended input-output analysis has been widely
used to estimate production- and consumption-based emissions in
many countries (Peters, 2008.  Hertwich and Peters, 2009.  IPCC, 2014),
and in Japan a national emission inventory has been provided to the
public every ﬁve years (NIES, 2016).  A major advantage of using environmental energy input-output analysis is that product supply-chain
networks can be easily modelled and environmentally and ecologically
important sectors and paths can be identiﬁed from the network
(Lenzen, 2003.  Lenzen Name, 2012.  Wood and Lenzen, 2009.  Oshita,
2012).  Clustering analysis has also been applied to environmental
energy input-output analysis in order to ﬁnd environmentally important
industry groups (i. e. , industry clusters) that induce higher CO2 emissions
along their supply-chains (Kagawa Name, 2013a, 2013b, 2015). 
It is important to note that the environmentally critical sectors,
transactions, paths, and clusters identiﬁed by input-output analysis
play important roles in reducing consumption-based emissions through
the entire economy.  A supply-chain path is composed of transactions
between two sectors.  An environmentally critical sector as identiﬁed
by key sector analysis (Rasmussen, 1956.  Hirschman, 1958.  Hazari,
1970.  Lenzen, 2003) is considered to be a sector that contributes to
emitting larger environmental emissions (e. g. , CO2 emissions) in the
economy through not only purchasing emission- and energy-intensive
products from other upstream sectors but producing emission- and
energy-intensive products in its own sector.  Therefore, an effective
emission reduction policy (i. e. , technology policy) is to improve the
production technology of the critical sector toward a cleaner one that
has less energy consumption and environmental emissions along the
product supply chain. 
Information on environmentally critical paths (Lenzen, 2003) and
clusters (Kagawa Name, 2013a, 2013b, 2015.  Rifki Name, 2017) can support a technology policy in the sense that policymakers can ﬁnd highpriority supply-chain paths (i. e. , upstream products) and clusters
(i. e. , upstream product systems).  However, it is not an easy task to ﬁnd
high-priority paths and clusters from the supply-chain complexity due
to the problem of computation (e. g. , Kagawa Name, 2015). 
Liang Name (2016) proposed a useful indicator, vertex betweenness
centrality, of a speciﬁc sector by combining input-output analysis with
social network analysis.  More speciﬁcally, Liang Name (2016) formulated
the vertex betweenness centrality index by applying the notion of network centrality (Freeman, 1977, 1978.  Freeman Name, 1979) to structural path analysis (Lenzen, 2003.
