
This paper examines whether the quality of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) is higher when the acquiring firm and
target firm share the same external auditor. 1 Our intuition is that the acquisition process often involves considerable
uncertainty, including information asymmetry between bidders and targets regarding their operations, financial health, risk
and prospects as well as uncertainty related to post-acquisition operational synergies.  This uncertainty can negatively
impact M&A quality by reducing managers' ability to identify the most profitable investment projects (Goodman Name,
2014).  We argue that when an acquirer and target share a common auditor, the auditor can help reduce uncertainty along
several dimensions. 
First, auditors accumulate a considerable amount of information about their clients through conducting their audit
procedures and through informal discussions with top management, allowing them to be helpful as information
intermediaries both before the M&A (e. g. , identifying potential merger counterparties and assisting with due diligence) and
after the M&A (e. g. , integrating accounting systems and internal controls). 
Second, since each audit firm has its own unique style of interpreting and implementing accounting rules (Kothari Name,
2010), firms represented by a common auditor are likely to have more comparable financial statements (Francis Name, 2014),
which leads to a reduction in uncertainty (De Franco Name, 2011).  That is, a merging firm can better understand the
assumptions and choices underlying accounting numbers in financial statements from other firms that share the same
auditor.  In turn, this leads to a better understanding (i. e. , reduced uncertainty) of those firms' economics, as compared to
those of firms using different auditors. 
Finally, common auditors may be more likely to limit misreporting that asymmetrically benefits one party over the other. 
Prior research indicates that acquirers (Louis, 2004; Gong Name, 2008) and targets (Anilowski Name, 2009) manage earnings
before M&As.  Thus, auditors that audit both the acquirer and target face greater litigation risk, as the common auditor may
be sued for earnings management undertaken by either party.  Moreover, common auditors likely face greater scrutiny by
stakeholders, given the potential for conflicts of interest.  As Agrawal Name (2013) show, deals with common M&A advisors
attract securities class action lawsuits with greater frequency than deals with separate advisors.  Thus, a common auditor has
arguably higher incentives to limit misreporting ex ante, leading to reduced uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the
reported numbers.  By reducing uncertainty during the M&A process, common auditors can help firms allocate capital more
efficiently, resulting in higher quality acquisitions. 
To test whether common auditors are associated with higher quality M&As, we use a sample of 1971 U. S.  acquisitions
between 1988 and 2010, where both the acquirer and the target are public firms and the acquirer obtains complete control
of the target after the acquisition.  To capture M&A quality, we use the acquisition announcement return following a large
body of research (e. g. , Asquith Name, 1983; Bradley Name, 1988; Cai and Sevilir, 2012; Agrawal Name, 2013; Goodman Name,We find that M&As involving firms with a common auditor are of higher quality than M&As involving firms with
different auditors. 2 Further, we test and find that the common-auditor effect is stronger when there is greater preacquisition uncertainty, proxied by targets with higher growth, more volatility, greater research and development (R&D)
intensity, and larger bid–ask spreads.  Our results are robust to the inclusion of numerous control variables for auditor, firm
and deal characteristics, the merging firms' previous business relationships and geographical proximity, the existence of
shared M&A advisors and/or directors, and additional testing to address endogeneity concerns related to auditor selection. 
Collectively, these results are consistent with common auditors reducing uncertainty during the M&A process, which leads
to higher quality M&As. 
To get a sense of the economic magnitude of the common auditor effect, consider that the announcement period
abnormal returns are 1. 064% points higher in common-auditor deals than those in non-common-auditor deals.  Given that
the average market capitalization of an acquirer (target) in our sample is $8. 99 billion ($870 million), this difference in
announcement returns translates into an increase in the combined firm's market capitalization of $104. 9 million. 3
We then examine the three mechanisms (discussed above) through which common auditors reduce M&A uncertainty:
(1) discussions with the M&A parties, (2) financial statement comparability, and (3) limited misreporting.  With respect to
the first mechanism, we employ two different empirical approaches.  First, we show that the common-auditor effect is larger
when the acquirer and target use the same local office of the common auditor, as the auditor can more easily facilitate
discussions between these clients if they are all in the same location.  Second, we show that there is an increased probability
of an M&A for firms with a common auditor, as the auditor can both better match clients interested in engaging in M&A
deals and reduce uncertainties throughout the process that might otherwise derail the deal. 
To explore the second mechanism, i. e. , financial statement comparability, we examine whether firms in common-auditor
deals have more comparable financial statements than do firms in non-common-auditor deals.  Using differences in yearspecific total accruals (Francis Name, 2014) and the covariance of earnings across time (Barth Name, 2012; De Franco Name,
2011; Lang Name, 2010) as proxies for comparability, we find that acquirers and targets with common auditors have more
comparable financial statements than do those with different auditors. 
We also find less misreporting for common-auditor mergers, the third mechanism, using performance-matched
abnormal accruals (Kothari Name, 2005) and financial statement restatements (Bens Name, 2012) as proxies for misreporting. 
Combined, these results support our inferences that common auditors reduce uncertainty in the M&A process by improving
(public and private) communication channels. 
Finally, we examine whether the common-auditor effect is mitigated after the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX).  Section 201 of
SOX prohibits auditors from engaging in non-audit services, such as M&A advisory and consulting services.  To the extent
auditors were engaged in non-audit services before SOX and common auditors used these services to help their clients
engage in better acquisitions, the common-auditor effect should be mitigated post-SOX.  However, we find that the
common-auditor effect remains after SOX.  This result suggests that the role of common auditors in reducing uncertainty is
unlikely driven by non-audit function communications. 
An important caveat to our findings is that, despite all our empirical analyses, discussions between auditors and their
clients are unobservable.  Thus, we cannot directly speak to the amount or type of information provided by common auditors
during M&As.  Given that American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Rule 301 prohibits disclosure of
confidential
information without consent from the client, if auditor discussions do indeed contain relevant private
information, it should be approved by the appropriate parties; that said, we recognize that there is potential for conflicts
of interest to arise.  We leave this for future research and regulators to determine. 4
Our study makes several important contributions.  First, we add to the literature that examines the role of auditors in
M&As.  Prior studies generally examine the roles of acquirer auditors and target auditors separately.  For example, Louis
(2005) studies the role of acquirer auditors in M&A transactions and finds higher acquisition announcement returns for nonBig 4 firms, while other studies find that targets with Big 4 auditors are more likely to get acquired (Xie Name, 2013) and have
greater acquisition synergy and higher acquirer announcement returns (Golubov Name, 2012).  In this study, we consider both
acquirer auditors and target auditors in examining how sharing an auditor influences acquisition performance, providing
new insights into the role of auditors in M&As. 
Second, our paper contributes to the emerging literature on the real effects of accounting and auditing.  In particular,
prior research finds that accounting information facilitates more efficient corporate investment by reducing agency
problems caused by information asymmetry (e. g. , Biddle Name, 2009; Biddle and Hilary, 2006), by providing peer firms with
more information (e. g. , Badertscher Name, 2013), and by providing information to managers within the firm (Shroff, 2014;
McNichols and Stubben, 2008).  In addition, Kausar Name (2014) show that firms' choice to obtain an audit helps lower
information asymmetry and leads to more efficient investment.  We contribute to this line of research by showing that
common auditors reduce uncertainty in the M&A process, and thus improve M&A quality. 
Third, we contribute to the large literature examining the effect of sharing an agent on economic outcomes.  For example,
the economics literature analyzes the use of a common agent as a way for competitors to achieve implicit collusion (e. g. ,
Bernheim and Whinston, 1985; Gal-Or, 1985, 1986; Vives, 1990).  In this setting, a common agent behaves passively and
information transfers among competitors can be widely observed.  In contrast, Villas-Boas (1994) and Gardiner Name (2007)
consider a setting where a common agent can act strategically, and examine conflicts that arise from sharing the same
advertising agency and sharing the same real estate agent.  More closely related to our study, Agrawal Name (2013) examine
the role of common investment bank advisors in M&As, and find that such deals are somewhat better for acquirers than they
are for targets.  Similarly, Cai and Sevilir (2012) find that board connections favor the acquirer, but the manner of benefit is a
function of the type of board connection.  We contribute to this literature by providing evidence on the impact of sharing an
auditor on M&A outcomes as well as the mechanisms through which these outcomes manifest. 
Finally, our study complements concurrent work by Dhaliwal Name (2015), who also examine the role of common
auditors in M&A transactions.  Our study delves into the mechanisms through which common auditors affect M&A
outcomes.  We find evidence consistent with the common auditor resolving information uncertainty between the parties in
the transaction.  Dhaliwal Name (2015) examine whether one party reaps greater benefits from the deals and find evidence
consistent with the acquirer capturing the benefits, as indicated by higher acquirer event returns.  In addition, Dhaliwal Name's study suggests that target firm shareholders may be worse off because target event returns and deal premiums are
lower.  While Dhaliwal Name's wealth transfer result is certainly interesting, we find that the overall combined
announcement return is positive.  We caution, however, that the studies use somewhat different samples and tests, and
thus the results cannot be fully interpreted together.  We leave it to future research to further examine the various aspects
and consequences of a common auditor in M&A transactions. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.  In Section 2, we discuss the M&A process as well as how a common auditor
can help reduce uncertainties in that process.  Section 3 describes the sample selection process, and Section 4 details the
research design and empirical results.  We present additional analyses in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6. 
2.  Motivation
Mergers and acquisitions represent significant corporate events that involve a thorough and dynamic process that can
vary from several months to several years to complete.  In general, the M&A process starts with the identification of potential
target candidates, which is a function of the firm's strategic objectives and requires some preliminary screening of the
candidates.  After a candidate is chosen, the firm engages in a lengthy due diligence process, which includes developing an
extensive understanding of the target value as a stand-alone business as well as the value of potential synergies (Copeland
Name, 2000).  As GE Capital (2012) indicates,
“Due diligence is not a courtship, a negotiation, or an inquisition; it's a fact-finding mission…[y]our business review of
the target becomes a true audit, aimed at gaining a thorough understanding of the target's operations, assets,
liabilities, and outlook.  Your due diligence team will be looking to confirm the target's representations, validate its
valuation, probe any legal, regulatory and compliance concerns, and affirm expected synergies and integration plans. ”
After obtaining considerable information through the due diligence phase, negotiations begin between the acquirer and target
regarding the acquisition price, the deal structure, etc.  When the negotiations are done and the deal is complete, the firms enter the
final phase—the integration of the two firms.  There are numerous factors for the acquiring firm to consider during the integration
phase, such as the development and articulation of the vision for the new entity to employees and other stakeholders, legal and tax
issues, human resource issues (e. g. , employee retention/severance), and fixed asset allocations.  Further, underlying all of these
factors is the integration of the accounting information systems to capture these economic changes. 
As becomes apparent through the above discussion of the M&A process, each phase contains significant uncertainty. 
From identifying merger partners to conducting due diligence to valuing and negotiating the deal to post-M&A integration,
managers face uncertainty throughout the process and its negative impact on firm value.  In particular, extant research
indicates that uncertainty negatively affects acquirer announcement returns and post-acquisition performance (McNichols
and Stubben, 2015; Erickson Name, 2012) and that having more firm-specific target information helps improve acquirer
returns and the expected value of combined firms (Martin and Shalev, 2009).  Given that M&As are typically large and
important corporate transactions, managerial incentives are strong to combat adverse selection inherent in the identification and valuation of potential deals.  As a result, firms often turn to investment bankers to serve as advisors during the M&A
process.  Consistent with uncertainty driving firms' decisions to retain M&A advisors, Servaes and Zenner (1996) find that
acquirers hire advisors when the deals are more complex and when the acquirer lacks prior acquisition experience. 
Investment banks can help match acquirers with targets, advise acquirers on target valuation, and/or counsel firms in
negotiating the deal price and structure (Goodman Name, 2014). 
While firms hire investment banks to reduce uncertainty in an attempt to make better investment decisions, we argue
that auditors can also serve to reduce uncertainty in the M&A process, even though they are not explicitly retained by firms
to do so.  In particular, auditors that audit both the acquirer and target (i. e. , common auditors) can reduce M&A uncertainty
through several channels.  The first, and arguably most important, channel is the direct communication of information
between the common auditor and the acquirers and targets, which can happen throughout the M&A process.  As indicated to
us in a private conversation with a Big 4 accounting partner, auditors often introduce their clients as potential acquisition
partners.  Thus, the auditor can facilitate discussions at the initial stage of the M&A process. 
Auditors can also provide considerable value during the due diligence phase, which includes assessing the target firm's
financial health, risks, prospects, etc.  After all, many of these assessments (or similar assessments) are made by the auditor
during an audit, so they can assist by providing both structure to the due diligence processes/analyses and insights into the
target based on their extensive knowledge of the firm.  In fact, further discussion with the Big 4 partner revealed that, with
the consent of clients, audit team members of the acquirer and the target often exchange information. 5 These discussions
can be very useful in appropriately valuing firms, and thus in negotiating the deal. 
The transfer of information between common-auditor clients continues even after the M&A as well.  For example,
common auditors can help integrate accounting information systems and internal control systems following deal
completion, which is a nontrivial task that is vital to the success of the M&A.  Since common auditors are familiar with
these systems for both the acquiring firm and the target firm, they can more efficiently amalgamate the systems to better
capture the firm's economics.  Erickson Name (2012) report increases in uncertainty after M&As, which contributes to
acquirers' post-acquisition wealth losses.  Common auditors can help reduce this uncertainty by assisting with the
integration of the accounting information systems to better capture the underlying economics of the firm. 
The second channel through which common auditors can reduce uncertainty is via financial statement comparability.  Kothari
Name (2010) argue that each accounting firm has its own unique set of internal working rules that guide and standardize the audit
firm's application of accounting and auditing standards. 6 Francis Name (2014) argue that because these systematic differences exist
across audit firms, financial statements are more similar for firms with a common auditor than they are for firms with different
auditors.  In addition, clients often seek guidance from their auditors when preparing financial reports, which further contributes to
increased comparability of financial statements across firms with a common auditor. 7 Consistent with common auditors influencing
comparability between firms' financial statements, Francis Name (2014) provide evidence that firms audited by the same auditor
have more comparable earnings than firms audited by different auditors.  By enhancing financial statement comparability, common
auditors indirectly provide their clients information that other (non-client) firms may not be able to efficiently obtain.  In particular,
a client firm can better understand the assumptions and accounting choices underlying the financial statement numbers of other
client firms.  In turn, this knowledge leads to a reduction in uncertainty regarding those firms' economics. 
The third channel through which common auditors can reduce M&A uncertainty is by limiting financial statement
misreporting.  Erickson and Wang (1999) find that acquirers boost earnings prior to stock-for-stock acquisitions in an effort
to increase their stock price and reduce the number of shares issued in exchange.  Louis (2004) and Gong Name (2008)
confirm these findings and show that the long-term post-acquisition underperformance of stock-for-stock acquirers and
post-acquisition lawsuits can be attributed to pre-acquisition abnormal accruals.  Anilowski Name (2009) find that targets
also engage in earnings management and sell via auctions to avoid the risk of detection.  The authors also find that such
deals result in higher wealth gains to target shareholders. 
Given the incentives for both acquirers and targets to manage earnings before M&As, auditors that audit both the acquirer
and target face greater litigation risk, as the common auditor may be sued for earnings management undertaken by either
party.  Moreover, common auditors likely face greater scrutiny by stakeholders, given their role as a common agent with the
opportunity for conflicts of interest.  As Agrawal Name (2013) document, deals with common M&A advisors attract securities
class action lawsuits with greater frequency than deals with separate advisors.  To the extent common auditors face greater
litigation (and potentially reputational) risk, they have greater incentives to limit misreporting that asymmetrically benefits
one party over the other, resulting in more transparent financial information and reduced uncertainty. 
Collectively, common auditors can help reduce uncertainty throughout the various stages of the M&A process both
directly through private communications with the acquirer and target and indirectly through more comparable and more
transparent public financial reports.  This reduction in uncertainty regarding the firms' underlying economics facilitates
better matching and integration of acquirers with targets, which leads to higher quality investment decisions. 
<Middle> Sample selection. 
To conduct our analyses, we obtain a sample of acquisitions from the Thomson Reuters Securities Data Company (SDC)
U. S.  Mergers and Acquisitions database.  We identify all completed domestic mergers and acquisitions of public acquirers
and public targets with announcement dates between 1988 and 2010.  We start our sample period in 1988 because we
obtain auditor information from Compustat, and its auditor coverage prior to 1988 is limited to Big 8 auditors.  We exclude
small transactions in which the deal value is less than $1 million and/or less than 1% of the acquirer's market capitalization
prior to the announcement date.  We also require the acquirer to control
less than 50% of the target before the
announcement and own 100% after the deal completion to ensure a complete change in control. 8 We further limit our
sample to deals in which both the acquirer and the target have daily stock return data from the Center for Research in
Security Prices (CRSP) and the annual accounting data and auditor information from Compustat for at least one year prior to
the deal announcement.  Applying these filters leaves a final sample of 1971 acquisitions, where 547 (1424) acquisitions are
classified as common-auditor (non-common-auditor) deals. 
Table 1, Panel A presents the distribution of our sample by deal announcement year.  Consistent with the M&A literature,
the number of acquisitions drops in the early 2000s from its highest level in the late 1990s.  We also observe a significant
slowdown following the 2007–2008 financial crisis.  The patterns of common-auditor deals and non-common-auditor deals
across years follow trends similar to that of the overall sample. 
Table 1, Panel B shows the industry composition for the acquiring firms in our sample using the Fama and French 48
industry classification (Fama and French, 1997).  Business services, computers, and pharmaceutical products are the most
active industries in our sample in terms of the number of acquisitions.  We observe a similar pattern in common-auditor
deals and non-common-auditor deals.  Given the variations in merger activity both across time and across industry, as
observed in Table 1, we include both year and industry fixed effects in our multivariate analyses. 
4.  Research design and empirical results
In this section, we discuss our research design and empirical results related to our three main analyses.  First, we examine
the relation between common auditors and M&A quality.  Second, we test whether the relation between common auditors
and M&A quality is stronger when there is greater pre-M&A uncertainty.  Finally, we analyze the three mechanisms through
which common auditors reduce uncertainty in the M&A process, namely via (i) private discussions with the acquirer and
target, (ii) enhanced financial statement comparability, and (iii) limited misreporting. 
4. 1.  Common auditors and M&A quality
4. 1. 1.  M&A quality measure
As discussed earlier, we predict that M&As with a common auditor are of higher quality because common auditors are
able to reduce uncertainty throughout the M&A process, which allows the parties to better identify profitable investment
opportunities.  We use the acquisition announcement return as our proxy for M&A quality following a large body of research
(e. g. , Asquith Name, 1983; Bradley Name, 1988; Kale Name, 2003; Cai and Sevilir, 2012; Agrawal Name, 2013; Goodman Name,
2014).  In particular, following Bradley Name (1988), Kale Name (2003) and Cai and Sevilir (2012), we measure portfolio
cumulative abnormal returns of the combined portfolio of the acquirer and the target around the acquisition announcement, ANN_CAR.  We obtain the announcement dates from the SDC U. S.  Mergers and Acquisitions database and estimate
portfolio abnormal returns using the standard event study method developed by Brown and Warner (1985).  We use the
CRSP value-weighted return as the market return and estimate the market model parameters over the 200 trading days
ending two months before the merger announcement. 9 For each acquisition, we form a value-weighted portfolio of the
acquirer and the target, with the weights based on their market capitalization at two months prior to the acquisition
announcement date.  To avoid double counting the acquirer's existing ownership in the target, we subtract the market value
of the target equity held by the acquirer from the target's market capitalization.  We then calculate the three-day ANN_CARs
over the event window ( 1,þ1), where event day 0 is the acquisition announcement date. 
4. 1. 2.  Empirical design – common auditors and M&A quality
To test whether acquisitions are of higher quality in common-auditor deals than in non-common-auditor deals, we
estimate the following ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model, where the dependent variable, ANN_CAR, is defined above.  Our main variable of interest, Common auditor, is an indicator
variable that equals one if the acquirer and the target share a common auditor and zero otherwise.  We include calendar year
fixed effects and Fama and French 48 industry fixed effects, and the t-statistics are based on standard errors clustered by
acquirer. 
Controls represents numerous control variables for auditor, firm, and deal characteristics shown by prior research to
impact M&A quality, where all of the control variables are defined in Appendix A.  Specifically, with respect to auditor
characteristics, we control for whether the acquirer and/or target have a Big 4 auditor, Big 4 Auditor, as Louis (2004) finds
that acquirers audited by non-Big 4 firms outperform those audited by Big 4 firms, and Xie Name (2013) and Golubov Name
(2012) show that target auditor size is associated with various deal outcomes. 10 We also control for the industry dominance
of auditors, Auditor industry dominance, as auditors with more industry expertise may lead to better acquisition outcomes
(Craswell Name, 1995; Hogan and Jeter, 1999; Solomon Name, 1999; Owhoso Name, 2002).  With respect to firm characteristics,
we control for Size, Operating cash flows and Tobin's Q to capture a firm's growth opportunities and financing availability
(Moeller Name, 2004; Dong Name, 2006).  We also include Leverage to control for creditor monitoring (Maloney Name, 1993;
Masulis Name, 2007) and Pre-announcement stock price run-up (Rosen, 2006) for both the acquirer and target.  Finally, we
include several commonly used deal characteristic control variables, i. e. , Relative deal size (Asquith Name, 1983), Percentage of
stock financing (Travlos, 1987; Moeller Name, 2004), Tender offer indicator, Hostile bid indicator (Schwert, 2000), Multiple
bidders indicator (Mitchell Name, 2004), and High-tech firms indicator (Masulis Name, 2007). 
In addition to the auditor, firm and deal characteristic controls, we control for several additional variables.  In particular,
Morck Name (1990) show that when the acquirer and target are similar, the acquisition has greater announcement returns.  If
firms with greater similarity tend to hire the same accounting firm as well, firm similarity could be a correlated omitted
variable.  Accordingly, we control for whether the deal is a diversifying acquisition, Diversifying acquisition, as well as the
daily stock return correlation between the acquirer and the target prior to the acquisition announcement, Corr(stock return),
following Fama and French (1992). 11
We also include several controls for M&As where the acquirer and target may already have considerable knowledge of
one another.  In particular, we control for whether the acquirer and target have had a previous business relationship (i. e. ,
strategic alliance or joint venture) in the three years before the acquisition, Previous business relation, as Higgins and
Rodriguez (2006) find that acquisitions generate better announcement returns if they are preceded by strategic alliance
activity between the acquirer and the target.  In a similar vein, we also control for the acquirer's equity ownership
percentage in the target before the deal announcement, Toehold. 12 Finally, we control for whether the acquirer's
headquarters are in close geographic proximity to the headquarters of the target, Local deal, as Uysal Name (2008) find
that acquirer announcement returns in local deals are higher than those in nonlocal deals. 13
4. 1. 3.  Descriptive statistics
Table 2 reports descriptive statistics for our M&A quality measure, ANN_CAR, in Panel A as well as our control variables in
Panel B.  As indicated in Panel A, the mean and median three-day ANN_CARs for the full sample are 1. 91% and 1. 22%,
respectively, and both are statistically significant at the 1% level.  These positive portfolio returns are consistent with prior
research (e. g. , Andrade Name, 2001; Wang and Xie, 2009).  Columns 2 and 3 present the subsample statistics where we split
the full sample into common-auditor deals and non-common-auditor deals.  As shown, the mean (median) difference in
three-day ANN_CAR between common-auditor deals and non-common-auditor deals is 1. 06% (0. 30%), which is statistically
significantly at the 1% (5%) level.  To ensure that these results are not sensitive to the length of the return window, we also
examine five-day and seven-day announcement windows and continue to find significantly higher ANN_CARs in commonauditor deals than in non-common-auditor deals.  For our main analyses, we report the results using the three-day ANN_CAR
for brevity. 
As shown in Panel B of Table 2, the majority of acquirers (97%) and targets (94%) in our sample have Big 4 auditors. 
Moreover, common-auditor deals are more likely than non-common-auditor deals to involve Big 4 auditors for both the
acquirer and the target.  Target firms' auditors in common-auditor deals have more industry expertise, as they are more
likely to be the dominant auditor in the two-digit standard industrial classification (SIC) industry.  We also find that target
firms are associated with lower Operating cash flows in common-auditor deals and that such acquisitions are less likely to be
hostile takeovers and less likely to have competing bidders.  In addition, acquirer and target returns are more highly
correlated, acquirers own more of the targets' stock prior to the acquisitions, and acquirer and target headquarters are more
likely to be located in the same geographical area in common-auditor deals than in non-common-auditor deals.  We control
for these auditor, firm, and deal characteristics in our analyses. 
4. 1. 4.  Multivariate analysis – common auditors and M&A quality
Table 3 presents the results from estimating Eq.  (1) using OLS.  In Column 1, we do not include any control variables and
find that common auditors have a positive and significant effect on ANN_CAR.  In Column 2, we include auditor, firm, and
deal characteristic control variables as well as controls for firm similarity, previous business relations, and geographic
proximity.  Our baseline finding continues to hold with these control variables; the coefficient estimate for Common auditor
is 1. 064 and statistically significant at the 1% level, suggesting that M&As involving firms with a common auditor are of
higher quality. 
The coefficients for the control variables are also consistent with findings in the literature.  For example, we observe a
negative correlation between acquirer size and announcement returns (Kimbrough and Louis, 2011; Golubov Name, 2012),
acquisitions with greater relative deal size have higher announcement returns (Louis and Sun, 2010), highly stock-financed
deals are associated with lower announcement returns (Louis, 2005), announcement returns are higher in tender offers
(Golubov Name, 2012; Cai and Sevilir, 2012), and deals in which the acquirer and the target are in different industries are
associated with lower announcement returns (Morck Name, 1990). 
4. 2.  Common-auditor effect and uncertainty
We next examine the impact of common auditors on M&A quality conditioned on the amount of pre-M&A uncertainty.  If
common auditors are associated with higher quality M&As because they reduce uncertainty in the M&A process, then we
should observe a larger common-auditor effect when there is a greater degree of uncertainty before the M&A.  To test this
prediction, we adjust Eq.  (1) to include a proxy of uncertainty and interact it with the common-auditor indicator, as shown
below, where ANN_CAR and Common auditor are defined previously.  We predict that β3 is positive, as this indicates that the
common-auditor effect is larger when there is greater pre-M&A uncertainty.  We focus on the acquirer's uncertainty
regarding the target (rather than vice versa), because while the target faces some uncertainty regarding its asking price and
the associated contract terms, the acquirer faces significant uncertainty regarding the target valuation in addition to
determining its bid price and associated contract terms.  Moreover, while the target no longer exists after the merger, the
acquirer still faces considerable post-acquisition uncertainty associated with synergistic incorporation of the target (as
outlined in Section 2).  Thus, common auditors can be much more helpful for acquirers than they can for targets in reducing
uncertainty.  Accordingly, we focus on uncertainty regarding the target. 
Our first proxy for uncertainty is based on the target firm's sales growth.  Smith and Watts (1992) argue that high growth
firms are associated with a higher degree of information asymmetry.  Thus we expect uncertainty regarding the target to be
more severe, and thus the common-auditor effect on acquisition quality to be more pronounced, when the target is growing
at a more rapid pace.  We define Target sales growth as the percentage change in the target's sales from the previous year. 
Our second proxy for uncertainty is the stock return volatility of the target firm.  Estimating the true underlying value of
target firms that have higher stock return volatilities is more difficult (Officer Name, 2009; McNichols and Stubben, 2015),
and common auditors could play a more important role in such deals.  We define Target stock return volatility as the daily
stock return volatility of the target over the one-year period ending two months prior to the deal announcement. 
Our third measure of uncertainty is based on the target firm's R&D intensity (Aboody and Lev, 2000; Huddart and Ke,
2010; Chen Name, 2010).  Aboody and Lev (2000) argue that interpreting financial information is difficult for firms with high
R&D intensity because (i) R&D investments are more unique than investments in tangible assets, (ii) no liquid market exists
for R&D investments, and (iii) the information necessary to determine the value of assets that emerge from R&D
investments is harder to obtain.  We define Target R&D intensity as the ratio of current year R&D expenditure to sales in
the year prior to the deal announcement. 
Our fourth measure of uncertainty is the bid–ask spread of the target firm.  The bid–ask spread is a proxy for the degree of
information asymmetry because it represents one way that market makers protect themselves from expected losses in
trading with more informed traders (Leuz and Verrecchia, 2000).  Following LaFond and Watts (2008) and Khan and Watts
(2009), we obtain daily bid–ask spread from CRSP and scale it by the midpoint of the spread.  We define Target bid–ask
spread as the average of the daily spreads of the target firm over the one-year period ending two months prior to the deal
announcement. 14
Table 4 presents the results from estimating Eq.  (2), where the results are based on using Target sales growth, Target stock
return volatility, Target R&D intensity, and Target bid–ask spread as proxies for uncertainty in Column 1, 2, 3 and 4,
respectively.  In particular, the coefficient estimate for the interaction of Common auditor and the uncertainty proxies (i. e, β3)
is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level or better across all four specifications.  The evidence in Table 4 suggests
that common auditors have a greater impact on M&A quality when there is more uncertainty before the acquisition. 15
4. 3.  Mechanisms of reductions in uncertainty
Next, we examine the three main channels through which common auditors reduce uncertainty in the M&A process: (i)
discussions with the acquirer and target regarding the M&A, (ii) enhanced financial statement comparability, and (iii)
increased reporting transparency. 
4. 3. 1.  Primary information channel – discussions regarding M&A
The primary channel through which common auditors can reduce M&A uncertainty is via direct discussions with the
acquirer and target.  As discussed in Section 2, common auditors can help reduce uncertainty throughout the M&A process,
from assistance in the identification and matching of potential M&A targets to help during the due diligence phase with
valuing the target to post-acquisition integration of information systems.  Unfortunately, these discussions are not
observable; as such, we employ two different empirical approaches.  First, we examine whether the common-auditor effect
is larger when the acquirer and target use the same local office of the common auditor.  The intuition is that the auditor can
more easily facilitate discussions between clients if they are in the same location as both the acquirer and the target.  Second,
we examine whether there is an increased probability of an M&A for firms with a common auditor.  Since an auditor is much
more knowledgeable about its own clients, it can not only better match clients interested in engaging in M&A transactions,
but also reduce uncertainties throughout the process that might otherwise derail the M&A.  Accordingly, we predict that if
common auditors help facilitate information flow via discussions with their clients, there should be a higher probability of
an M&A with other firms that share the same auditor. 
To conduct our first analysis (i. e. , same-office test), we collect auditor office location data from Audit Analytics, which
provides audit office location data starting in 2002.  For deals announced before 2002 and/or with missing auditor office data
in Audit Analytics, we manually collect the data from the audit report in Form 10-K filings.  Because Form 10-K filings are
unavailable in the SEC EDGAR system before 1996, our sample is reduced to 1591 observations.  Of the 1591 observations,
459 deals (28. 8%) involve a common auditor, and 120 deals (7. 5%) consist of a common auditor in the same local office.  Using
these data, we adapt Eq.  (1) by splitting Common auditor into two measures, Same-office common auditor and Different-office
common auditor, where Same-office common auditor is an indicator equal to one if the acquirer and the target share a
common auditor from the same local office and zero otherwise, and Different-office common auditor is an indicator equal to
one if the acquirer and the target share a common auditor from different local offices and zero otherwise. 
We report the results on same-office common auditors in Table 5.  Column 1 reports the results from estimating Eq.  (1)
using the reduced sample.  We find that common auditors are associated with significantly higher combined announcement
returns, consistent with the results in Table 3.  In Column 2, we report the results from estimating Eq.  (1), where we split
Common auditor into the two measures: Same-office common auditor and Different-office common auditor.  While the
coefficients on both variables are significantly positive, the coefficient on Same-office common auditor is greater than the
coefficient on Different-office common auditor, and this difference is statistically significant at the 10% level.  This result
suggests that while common auditors can enhance M&A quality, they are more effective at doing so when the acquirer and
target are audited by the same local audit office. 
To conduct our second analysis (i. e. , common-auditor M&A likelihood test), we follow a method similar to that in
Bodnaruk Name (2009) in examining the probability of two firms engaging in M&A activities.  Specifically, for each actual
acquirer, we define the set of all potential acquirers as those covered by Compustat in the same three-digit SIC industry and
of a similar size (within a 20% band of market capitalization). 16 We perform the same procedure for each actual target firm
and find its corresponding set of potential target firms.  We then identify whether a common auditor exists between each
potential acquirer and each potential target, and we create an indicator variable, Common auditor, that equals one if the
potential acquirer and the potential target in a given deal share the same auditor at the time of the deal announcement and
zero otherwise.  We then estimate a probit model in which the dependent variable is an indicator variable that equals one if
an acquisition takes place between the potential acquirer and the potential target and zero otherwise. 
Table 6 reports the marginal effects from estimating the probit regression.  Column 1 includes only the year and industry fixed
effects.  In Column 2, we follow Bodnaruk Name (2009) and include a number of control variables, including firm size, Tobin's Q,
leverage ratio, ROA, sales growth, stock return, stock return volatility, and industry Herfindahl index of the potential merging
firms.  In both models, we find that sharing a common auditor significantly increases the likelihood of an acquisition.  After
controlling for other determinants of acquisition likelihood, sharing a common auditor increases the likelihood of an M&A
between clients by 0. 2% points, which is sizable given that the sample mean of the probability of an M&A is 0. 7%. 
4. 3. 2.  Secondary information channel – financial statement comparability
The second channel through which common auditors can reduce M&A uncertainty is via enhanced financial statement
comparability.  As discussed above, because each audit firm has a unique style of interpreting and implementing accounting
rules (Francis Name, 2014; Blacconiere Name, 2011), firms can better understand the assumptions and choices underlying
accounting numbers in financial statements from firms that share the same auditor.  In turn, this leads to a better
understanding of those firms' economics, relative to that of firms using different auditors. 
To determine whether common-auditor firms engaged in an M&A have greater financial statement comparability, we conduct
two analyses.  First, we use the difference in the firms' year-specific total accruals as a proxy for comparability following Francis
Name (2014).  In particular, we calculate the absolute value of the difference in total accruals between the acquirer and the target in
the year prior to acquisition announcement (Diff_Total_Accruals), where total accruals are calculated as the difference between
income before extraordinary items and cash flows from operations, scaled by beginning of year total assets. 17 We then regress
Diff_Total_Accruals on Common auditor and several control variables.  Specifically, following Francis Name (2014), we control for the
minimum values and differences in size, leverage, market-to-book, cash flow from operations, losses, standard deviation of sales,
standard deviation of cash flow from operations, and standard deviation of sales growth.  We also exclude financial institutions
because characteristics of accruals differ in these firms (Louis, 2004).  Eliminating observations with data restrictions and financial
institutions reduces our sample size to 1679 observations. 
Second, as an alternate proxy for financial statement comparability, we use the firms' covariance of earnings across time
(Barth Name, 2012; De Franco Name, 2011; Lang Name, 2010).  Specifically, we estimate the earnings co-movement between the
acquirer and the target in the 16 quarters prior to acquisition announcement (ECOMP_COV), where we measure the level of
covariance as the adjusted R2 from the regression of the acquirer's income before extraordinary items scaled by total assets
on the target's income before extraordinary items scaled by total assets.  We then regress ECOMP_COV on Common auditor
and several control variables.  In particular, we include the same control variables used in the total accruals analysis, plus we
control for cash flow comovement and return comovement across 16 consecutive quarters (Francis Name, 2014).  We require
at least 10 quarters of data available for both the acquirer and the target in estimating earnings comovement.  These data
restrictions reduce the sample size to 1513 observations. 18
Table 7 reports the results from the estimation of the comparability tests.  In particular, Column 1 (2) shows the results from our
comparability analysis using differences in total accruals (earnings comovement) as our proxy for financial statement comparability. 
As indicated in both columns, the coefficient estimate for Common auditor is statistically significant in the predicted directions. 
Specifically, in column 1, the coefficient for Common auditor ( 0. 020) is negative and significant at the 5% level, suggesting that
there are smaller differences in total accruals between acquirers and targets in common-auditor M&As, as compared to those in
non-common-auditor M&As.  In column 2, the coefficient for Common auditor (0. 026) is positive and significant at the 10% level,
indicating greater earnings comovement for acquirers and targets in common-auditor M&As relative to those in non-commonauditor M&As.  Combined, the results in Table 7 provide support for the notion that the financial statements of acquirers and targets
are more comparable in common-auditor M&As than they are in non-common-auditor M&As. 
4. 3. 3.  Secondary information channel – limited misreporting
The third channel through which common auditors can reduce M&A uncertainty is by limiting misreporting and/or
increasing the confidence of the acquirer (target) that the target's (acquirer's) financial statements are accurate.  As discussed
above, both acquirers and targets have incentives to manage earnings.  Thus, auditors that audit both the acquirer and the
target face greater litigation risk as well as greater scrutiny by stakeholders, given their role as a common agent with the
opportunity for conflicts of interest.  To the extent common auditors face greater litigation (and potentially reputational) risk,
they have greater incentives to limit misreporting that asymmetrically benefits one party over the other, resulting in more
transparent financial information and reduced uncertainty. 
To determine whether there is less misreporting for common-auditor M&As relative to non-common-auditor M&As, we
use performance-matched abnormal accruals (Kothari Name, 2005) and financial statement restatements (Bens Name, 2012)
as proxies for misreporting.  For the accrual analysis, we examine both acquirer and target accruals; however, for the
restatement analysis, we examine restatements made by the newly merged firm.  Since our sample of acquisitions consists of
acquirers obtaining 100% ownership, the new company is a combination of the acquirer and target.  As such, when a
restatement is announced, we cannot identify whether it was the acquirer or the target that initiated the earnings
management.  That is, the restatements are announced for the new company rather than the acquirer or target separately, as
consolidated statements are presented for those earlier (pre-M&A) years. 
For our first misreporting analysis, we estimate quarterly unexpected accruals in the spirit of Erickson and Wang (1999). 
Following Louis (2004) and Gong Name (2008), we focus on current accruals because long-term accruals are less susceptible
to manipulation in the short run (Healy, 1985).  Following the suggestion of Kothari Name (2005), we control for firm
performance by matching on contemporaneous ROA (calculated as income before extraordinary items scaled by lagged total
assets). 19 Specifically, quarterly unexpected accruals are the residuals from the estimation of the following model,
where CACCit represents current accruals for firm i in quarter t, ATit 1 is total assets for firm i in quarter t 1, ΔREVit is the
change in revenue for firm i in quarter t, and Q1 (Q2, Q3, Q4) is an indicator that equals one for the first (second, third, fourth)
fiscal quarter and zero otherwise.  All indicator variables are deflated by lagged total assets.  We estimate the model for each
two-digit SIC industry.  We follow Erickson and Wang (1999) and focus on three quarters, q 2, q 1, and q0, where q0 is the
last quarter for which earnings are announced prior to the acquisition announcement.  Unexpected accruals (UA), our proxy
for earnings management, is the sum of q 2, q 1, and q0 unexpected accruals minus unexpected accruals of the industryand-performance-matched firm. 20
Table 8 provides the results from regressing UA on the Common auditor indicator.  We report the acquirers' UA in Columns
1 and 2 and targets' UA in Columns 3 and 4.  We include only year and industry fixed effects in Columns 1 and 3, and
we include the full set of control variables (as in Eq.  (1)) in Columns 2 and 4.  The number of observations for this analysis is
smaller (i. e. , 1526 and 1508 observations in the acquirer and target analyses, respectively) than that used in our main
analyses because we exclude financial firms for this analysis and unexpected accruals are not estimable for some
observations due to data restrictions.  The coefficient estimates for Common auditor are negative and statistically significant in Columns 1 and 2, supporting our conjecture that acquirers engage in less earnings management prior to the
acquisition when they share a common auditor with the target.  While the coefficient estimates for Common auditor are
negative also in Columns 3 and 4, they are statistically insignificant. 21 Erickson and Wang (1999) show that acquiring
firms manage earnings upward in the three quarters prior to the merger, but they do not find evidence of earnings
management in target firms, potentially because many target firms often have little time to respond to M&A offers.  Thus,
our weaker findings for the disciplining effect of common auditors on misreporting by targets may be a function of
lower power. 
For our second misreporting analysis, we examine whether the merging firms are less likely to restate earnings
if the acquirer and the target share a common auditor.  We focus on restatements filed by the newly merged firm for
misreporting made within two years before the merger completion.  This two-year window generally covers the fiscal
year prior to the merger announcement as well as the fiscal year between the merger announcement and the deal
completion, as more than 90% of the acquisitions in our sample complete the deal within one year from the merger
announcement. 
We collect earnings restatements from Audit Analytics.  Scholz (2008) argues that Audit Analytics is a more expansive
database than other restatement data sources, as the Audit Analytics software extracts information from all EDGAR filings,
which leads to a more efficient identification of restatements filed without being announced in a press release or a Form 8K.  Audit Analytics includes only restatements that correct misstated financial statements and exclude other financial
statement changes.  Following Bens Name (2012), we eliminate all clerical application errors and include only accounting rule
application failures and financial fraud to ensure that our sample includes material GAAP misapplications and not
unintentional reporting errors.  We use information about the beginning date of the misstatement period to identify
earnings misstatements within a two-year window before the merger completion. 
Columns 5 and 6 of Table 8 present the marginal effects from the probit regression of Restatement on Common auditor
without and with control variables, respectively, where Restatement is an indicator that equals one if the beginning date of
the misstatement period falls within a two-year window before the merger completion and zero otherwise.  The number of
observations for this analysis drops to 1356 because the coverage of restatements in Audit Analytics starts in 1996 and we
use a two-year window to identify misreporting before the deal completion.  As indicated in Column 5 (6), a common
auditor M&A is associated with a 3. 4% (3. 1%) point reduction in the likelihood of earnings restatements, as compared to a
non-common-auditor M&A, and this marginal effect is statistically significant at the 5% (10%) level.  Given that the sample
mean of the restatement probability is 8. 04%, the effect of common auditors in reducing the restatement probability is
economically meaningful.  Combined, the results in Tables 5–8 support our inferences that common auditors reduce
uncertainty in the M&A process by improving (public and private) communication channels. 
5.  Additional analyses
5. 1.  Strategic selection of auditor
One potential concern with our finding is the endogenous choice of auditors by the acquirer and the target.  In particular,
either party may strategically hire a common auditor prior to the acquisition announcement to influence deal outcomes or
for other reasons that lead to better M&A outcomes.  To address this potential issue, we examine the tenure of the auditor. 
Our intuition is that for auditor selection to be a concern, there must be a change in auditor shortly before the acquisition. 
That is, it is highly unlikely that firms switch auditors many years before an intended M&A to obtain the benefits of having a
common auditor. 
We find that acquirer (target) auditors have an average tenure of 10. 06 (7. 23) years in common-auditor deals and 9. 79
(7. 46) years in non-common-auditor deals.  Further, the acquirer (target) auditor's tenure is less than three years in 15. 2%
(18. 3%) of the common-auditor sample, and in 16. 5% (19. 0%) of the non-common-auditor sample.  Hence, merging firms do
not appear to strategically select auditors for M&As.  Nonetheless, we address the concern of strategic auditor selection using
two additional tests.  First, we create indicator variables that equal one if the acquirer's or target's auditor has a tenure less
than three years and zero otherwise, and then include interaction terms of Common auditor and these two indicator
variables.  If firms are being strategic in the appointment of common auditors, we should expect the common-auditor effect
on M&A outcomes to be more pronounced for shorter-tenured auditors.  In untabulated results neither of the interaction
terms is significant, and the coefficient of Common auditor continues to be positive and statistically significant at the 1%
level.  Second, we rerun our analysis on a subsample of acquisitions in which both the acquirer's auditor and the target's
auditor have been with the firms for at least three years.  The untabulated result is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to
those with the full sample. 22
5. 2.  Non-market based M&A quality measures
In our main analyses, we use the acquisition announcement return as our proxy for M&A quality.  In this section, we use
two non-market based measures that have also been used in the literature for M&A quality: (1) post-acquisition change in
ROA, ΔROA (Healy Name, 1992; Chen Name, 2007; Wang and Xie, 2009; Lin Name, 2011; Fu Name, 2013; Goodman Name, 2014),
and (2) the probability of a post-acquisition goodwill impairment, Prob_GW_Impair (Doellman and Ryngaert, 2010; Gu and
Lev, 2011; Goodman Name, 2014).  The advantages of these measures are that they are not as susceptible to market biases
and they represent ex post (as opposed to ex ante) measures of M&A quality.  ROA represents the actual economic
benefits generated by the assets, as opposed to the market's perception of the increase in value.  Further, a goodwill
impairment recorded in the post-acquisition period represents instances where the premium paid for the target's assets is
no longer justified.  However, the main drawback of these measures lies in the difficulty in isolating the performance effects
directly related to the acquisition from those of the rest of the firm.  Therefore, we focus on acquisition announcement
returns in our main analyses and provide supporting evidence using these ex post, non-market based measures in this
section. 
We rerun our main analyses, i. e. , Eqs.  (1) and (2), where we substitute ΔROA and Prob_GW_Impair as the dependent
variables and estimate the models using OLS estimation and a probit regression, respectively.  ΔROA is measured as the
three-year change in ROA, and Prob_GW_Impair is an indicator equal to one if there is a goodwill impairment in the threeyear period following an acquisition that generates a large increase in goodwill (i. e. , an increase in goodwill greater or equal
to 1% of total assets), and zero otherwise.  Due to data restrictions, our change in ROA sample declines from 1971 to 1684, but
there is no sample attrition for the goodwill impairment analysis.  In untabulated results, we find that when we rerun Eq.  (1)
with our non-market based M&A quality measures, the coefficient estimate for Common auditor is positive (negative) and
statistically significant at the 1% level (10% level) when using ΔROA (Prob_GW_Impair), consistent with our expectations and
the results in Table 3 that common-auditor M&As are of higher quality than non-common-auditor M&As.  When we rerun
our uncertainty analysis (Eq.  (2)), we find that the interaction coefficient estimate, β3, is positive and statistically significant
in three of the four specifications using ΔROA.  Further, the coefficient estimate for β3 is negative across all four specifications
using Prob_GW_Impair, suggesting a lower likelihood of post-acquisition goodwill
impairments for common-auditor
acquisitions with more uncertainty; however, the coefficients are not statistically significant.  Collectively, this evidence,
along with that in Tables 3 and 4, suggests that common auditors have a greater impact on M&A quality when there is more
uncertainty before the acquisition. 
5. 3. Impact of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act. 
Section 201 of SOX increased restrictions on non-audit services, such as M&A advisory and consulting services, provided
by independent auditors in an attempt to strengthen auditor independence.  To the extent auditors were engaged in nonaudit services before SOX and common auditors used these services to help their clients engage in better acquisitions, the
common-auditor effect should be mitigated post-SOX.  To examine this possibility, we partition our sample into pre- and
post-SOX subperiods and rerun our analyses.  We classify transactions announced between January 1988 and July 2002
(when SOX was enacted) as deals in the pre-SOX period, and those announced between August 2002 and December 2010 as
deals in the post-SOX period.  Untabulated results show that the common-auditor effect on acquisition announcement
returns is similar between the pre- and post-SOX periods, suggesting that the higher quality M&As associated with common
auditors are a result of reductions in uncertainty from (perhaps informal) communications within the audit function rather
than those within non-audit functions.  An alternative possibility is that these communications shifted from non-audit
functions to informal discussions within the audit function after SOX.  We cannot rule out this possibility. 
5. 4.  Shared investment banks and shared directors
Agrawal Name (2013) and Cai and Sevilir (2012) show that shared investment banks and interlocked directors influence
acquisition outcomes.  To examine whether the common-auditor effect is incremental to the effects of shared investment
banks or shared directors, we include a shared investment bank indicator and the shared director indicator in our model. 
Among our sample of 1971 acquisitions, only five deals (0. 25%) have shared investment banks, consistent with Agrawal Name
(2013), who also report a very low percentage of shared investment banks, i. e. , 98 out of 6272 deals (1. 6%).  Further, among our
sample of 961 deals with available data on shared directors, 93 deals (9. 7%) have shared director, which is comparable to the
9. 4% reported in Cai and Sevilir (2012). 23 Untabulated results show that the coefficient on Common auditor remains positive
and statistically significant even after we control for the shared investment bank indicator or the shared director indicator,
suggesting that the common-auditor effect is incremental to the effect of shared directors and shared investment banks. Impact of specific auditors
In our final analysis, we examine whether a particular auditor or subset of auditors drive the acquisition announcement
returns in our main analyses.  For example, Louis (2005) finds that acquirers audited by non-Big 4 accounting firms
outperform those audited by Big 4 firms.  Further, with the demise of Arthur Andersen in 2002, many firms switched
auditors and may have strategically selected auditors based, in part, on their ability to help with upcoming M&As. 
Accordingly, we conduct three tests.  First, we restrict our sample to Big 4 clients only, which results in a sample of 1813
observations.  Second, we remove deals with Andersen clients (acquirer or target) in years 2001 and 2002.  In both tests, our
results continue to hold at the 1% level. 
Finally, we examine whether the common-auditor effect on announcement returns is stronger for one of the largest eight
auditors in the sample (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, Deloitte & Touche, KPMG, Arthur Andersen, Grant
Thornton, BDO Seidman, or Crowe Chizek & Company).  Specifically, we include an interaction term, where we interact
Common auditor with an indicator for a specific auditor.  While Common auditor remains positive and statistically significant
at the 1% level, none of the interaction terms are significant, suggesting that the common-auditor effect is not stronger for
any particular auditor. 
<Conclusion> Conclusion. 
The acquisition process often involves significant uncertainty, which can negatively impact M&A quality by reducing
managers' ability to identify the most profitable investment projects.  This paper examines whether M&A quality is higher
when acquirers and targets share the same external auditor.  Given their considerable knowledge regarding both the
acquirer and the target, common auditors can help reduce uncertainty, and thus improve M&A quality, via (i) direct
communications with the merging parties, (ii) enhanced financial statement comparability, and (iii) limited misreporting. 
Using the acquisition announcement return to capture M&A quality, we find that M&As involving firms with a common
auditor are of higher quality than M&As involving firms with different auditors.  We also find that the common-auditor effect
is stronger when there is greater pre-acquisition uncertainty.
