 1.  Introduction In recent years, climate change has aroused worldwide attention, and in-depth international discussions have been held to mitigate climate change.  Since 2007, China has surpassed the US to become the world's largest CO2 emitter, and thus becomes a focus of global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.  As one of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, China has always been promoting the implementation of the Convention and fulﬁlling its obligations.  Chinese government committed to reduce CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic production (GDP) by 40–45% towards 2020 at 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Conference and by 60–65% towards 2030 at 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference.  To achieve such challenging emission-reduction targets, China has attempted to adopt effective policy instruments, such as the deployment of renewable energy, the establishment of national carbon emission trading market.  China has experienced a signiﬁcant increase in CO2 emissions in the past decades (Liu et al. , 2015).  Large variations in the growth pattern of China's CO2 emissions at the regional level exist due to uneven distribution of initial resource endowment, economic scale, industry structure, development stage etc.  (Meng et al. , 2016).  CO2 emissions per capita and CO2 emissions per unit of GDP among China's 30 regions also vary sharply (Shan et al. , 2016).  Emission-reduction targets for each region should be set in considering the characteristics of socio-economic development (Wang et al. , 2016).  Therefore, it is necessary to explore the driving forces of the variations of national and regional CO2 emissions of China in order to set accurate emission-reduction targets and take effective measures from the perspective of national and regionalThis study explores the changes of national and regional CO2 emissions using temporal decomposition analysis model, and analyzes the differences of CO2 emissions between China's 30 regions and the national average using spatial decomposition analysis model.  In addition, this study evaluates the potential of emission-reduction of China's 30 regions.  The study did not only contribute to the energy saving and emission reduction of China's CO2 emissions but also provide some targeted suggestion for emission-reduction at regional and sectoralThe remainder of this study is organized as follows.  Section 2 reviews some existing literature.  Section 3 presents the models including temporal and spatial decomposition analysis models and data sources used in this study, and the overview of the national and regional CO2 emissions in China.  Section 4 depicts the decomposition results and evaluates the potential of emission-reduction in China's 30 regions.  Section 5 details further discussion of the deep-rooted reasons of key factors with larger effect on CO2 emissions and the future tendency of contribution of key factors.  Section 6 shows conclusion of the analysis, with summary and policy implications.  2.  Literature review.  Existing studies have been conducted to analyze the driving forces of the variations of national and regional CO2 emissions from the perspective of temporal and spatial level.  First, tracking changes of CO2 emissions and quantifying the driving forces of the changes over time have long been a focus area of researchers and policymakers.  Intensive studies have analyzed the CO2 emissions and the driving forces of the change of CO2 emissions at national (Wu et al. , 2005.  Jung et al. , 2012.  Cortés-Borda et al. , 2015.  Sumabat et al. , 2016.  van Ruijven et al. , 2016), regional (Liang et al. , 2007.  Geng et al. , 2013.  Wang et al. , 2017) and industrial level (Lin and Moubarak, 2013.  Xu and Lin, 2016a.  Talbi, 2017) overSecond, growing interest among researchers in comparing regions in terms of CO2 emissions emerges in recent years.  The comparison allows variations among countries or regions to be revealed, the contributing factors identiﬁed, and the scope for improvement better understood (Ang et al. , 2016).  Many studies on analyzing the differences in CO2 emissions among different countries (Sun, 2000a, 2000b.  Zhang and Ang, 2001.  Bataille et al. , 2007), regions (Feng et al. , 2009.  Su and Ang, 2016.  Xu and Lin, 2016b.  Wang et al. , 2016.  Xu et al. , 2016), and a speciﬁc sector among regions (Cui and Li, 2015.  Xu and Lin, 2016a, 2016c.  Long et al. , 2016) have also been conducted.  Besides, some studies are also involved in the spatio-temporal analysis on the differences in regional CO2 emissions in recent years (Huang and Meng, 2013.  Kim and Dall'erba, 2014.  Chen and Yang, 2015.  Ang et al. , 2016).  Existing literatures on the spatial analysis mainly focus on the differences in CO2 emissions among regions from the perspective of production or a speciﬁc production sector, and less literature are involved in householdDecomposition analysis is usually used to analyze the variations in energy usage and emissions (Ang, 2015).  The model can not only identify the main driving forces of the variations in an aggregation but also show the clearly quantitative results of to what extent the driving forces affect the variations (Su and Ang, 2012, 2015).  The logistics mean Division index (LMDI) model is a preferred index decomposition analysis approach because of the advantages of path independence, residue free, ability to handle zero values, and consistency in aggregation (Ang, 2004).  Previous studies mainly adopted LMDI model to study the determinants of variations of an aggregate based on the data collected chronologically at different points in time for a speciﬁc region, such as Ang and Liu (2001), Wang et al.  (2005), Mairet and Decellas (2009), Wang and Li (2016), Shao et al.  (2016), Lin and Ahmad (2017).  Therefore, this study uses LMDI method to conduct a temporal decomposition analysis of the changes of national and regional CO2 emissions of China.  Ang et al.  (2015) proposed a multi-regional (M-R) spatial decomposition model, which can be used to analyze why the differences in CO2 emissions exist among countries or among different regions within a country.  The model shows an advantage in reducing decomposition cases, avoiding subjectivity in benchmark region selection, maintaining the property of circularity, and providing valuable information in terms of the potential of energy-saving and emission-reduction.  Therefore, this study adopts the M-R spatial decomposition model to compare the CO2 emission performance of China's 30 regions.  This study explores the driving forces of the changes of national and regional CO2 emissions using LMDI model, and investigates the driving forces of the differences of CO2 emissions between China's 30 regions and the national average using multi-regional M-R spatial decomposition analysis model.  Compared with the existing studies, the main contributions of this study are as follows.  (1) We carry out an in-depth analysis to uncover the main driving forces of the changes of national and regional CO2 emissions in China, and to analyze the dominant driving forces of the differences in CO2 emissions among China's 30 regions.  The study provides deep insights into why and what degree the key factors affect national and regional CO2 emissions of China from the perspective of temporal and spatial dimensions, and offers policymakers references to formulate and implement targeted mitigation policies at both national and regional level.  (2) The original M-R spatial decomposition analysis model is improved in this study.  On one hand, household sector is introduced into the M-R spatial decomposition model for the ﬁrst time, and thus this study quantiﬁes the effects of urbanization, income improvement and population.  On the other hand, economic output and economic structure are introduced into the model in aspect of production sector.  The improved temporal and spatial decomposition analysis models in this study can be employed to analyze the variation of an aggregation, such as energy, water, waste, pollutants etc. , from the perspective of both production sector and household sector.  <Middle> Modelology and data.  3. 1.  Decomposition model.  3. 1. 1.  Kaya identity.  In the decomposition analysis framework, energy-related CO2 emissions are classiﬁed into two categories according to emission sources.  energy-related CO2 emissions from production sector and energy-related CO2 emissions from household sector.  National and regional CO2 emissions in China can be decomposed into nine kinds of driving forces, as shown in Eq.  (1).  Where, i denotes each region in China.  j denotes the sectors involved in this study (j=1,2,⋯,6 for agriculture, industry, construction, service, urban residents and rural residents).  k denotes the energy type consumed by each sector (k= 1, 2,⋯,12 for raw coal, coke, crude oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, LPG, reﬁnery gas, other petroleum products, natural gas and electricity).  The variables involved in the temporal and spatial decomposition models are deﬁned in Tables 1 and 2.  3. 1. 2.  Temporal decomposition analysis.  Based on additive LMDI model proposed by Ang (2005), the aggregate changes of CO2 emissions for each region of China between the base year 0 and the target year T are decomposed into 9 driving forces, see Eq.  (2), i. e. , carbon intensity effect, energy intensity effect in the production sector, energy intensity effect in the household sector, energy structure effect, industrial structure effect, urbanization effect, economic scale effect, population scale effect and household income improvement effect.  The effects of various driving forces of regional CO2 emissions between the base year 0 and the target year T for region i are calculated using the following equations.  3. 1. 3.  Spatial decomposition analysis.  Spatial decomposition analysis is a popular useful in comparing differences in energy consumption, energy efﬁciency or CO2 emissions among regions within a country in a particular year (Su and Ang, 2016).  This study adopts the M-R spatial decomposition analysis model to analyze the differences of CO2 emissions among different regions in China.  In this spatial decomposition framework, each targeted region is chosen to compare with a reference entity given by the arithmetic average of the entire group.  In this study, China's 30 regions are ranked according to the descending order of the CO2 emissions, and the national average is chosen as the benchmark reference for comparison for each pair.  The differences of CO2 emissions between the regions i and the national average (∗), denoted as ΔCtot (Ri−R∗), can be decomposed to give.  Notably, carbon emission factors are constant for different fossil energy, and carbon intensity effect including ΔCi, CIare always zero in the decomposition analysis.  Therefore, this study considers the effects of other eight kinds of driving forces of national and regional CO2 emissions in the following analysis.  3. 2.  Data source, processing and variables.  The study period is from 2000 to 2015, and is divided into 4 subperiods, i. e. , 2000–2005, 2006–2008, 2009–2012 and 2013–20,015 in the temporal decomposition analysis.  The spatial scale includes China's 30 regions, which consists of 30 provinces and municipalities in mainland3. 2. 1.  Energy consumption (E) and CO2 emissions (C).  The data for energy consumption and CO2 emissions of each region in mainland China are derived from China Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs). 2 National energy consumption and CO2 emissions are the aggregation of China's 30 regional to ensure data consistency.  The data for national and regional energy consumption are from Energy Inventories for China and its 30 regions and cities in CEADs (Seen Table A. 1).  The amount of energy consumption is measured by million tons of standard coal equivalent (Mtce).  Twelve types of energy resource are included in this study, i. e. , raw coal, coke, crude oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, LPG, reﬁnery gas, other petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. 3 CEADs also publishes the latest CO2 emission inventories for China and its 30 regions and cities, and two approaches are used to calculate the CO2 emissions.  apparent emission accounting approach and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sectoral approach.  In this study, the data for CO2 emissions of each region are from emission inventories by IPCC sectoral approach.  CO2 emissions for fossil fuel consumption and for industrial processes by IPCC sectoral approach are calculated based on Energy consumption data and Emission factors, seen Eqs.  (22) and (23).  Where, CEij represents the CO2 emissions of different sectors and energy ' represents the adjusted energy consumption.  NCVj repretypes.  ADij sents the net caloriﬁc value of different energy types.  EFj refers to the emission factors.  and Oij refers to the oxygenation efﬁciency of different sectors and energy types.  CEt represents the carbon emissions of industrial products, ADt represents output of each industrial product and EFt represents the emission factors for each industrial product.  In addition, this study considers CO2 emissions from both fossil fuel consumption and industrial processes when conducting overview analysis of the national and regional CO2 emissions of China in Section 2, and focuses on CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption in the temporal and spatial decomposition analysis in Section 4.  Energy-related CO2 emissions at national and regional level are shown in Table A. 2.  3. 2. 2.  Variables in socio-economic development.  GDP, value-added of various sectors, disposable income and population in each region used in this study are obtained from China Statistical Yearbook (NBSC, 2000-2015).  The multiple sectors are classiﬁed into two categories.  production sector (i. e. , agriculture, industry, construction, and service sector) and household sector (i. e. , urban and rural household sector) in our decomposition analysis framework.  To study the driving forces of CO2 emissions of China, the variables including energy structure, energy intensity by sector, GDP, industrialization rate, urbanization rate, population, and urban and rural disposable income per capita are chosen in this study. 4 The details are as follows.  3. 2. 2. 1.  Energy intensity.  During 2000–2015, most regions experienced an inverted U-shaped evolution trend in energy intensity.  However, energy intensity in Ningxia showed a continuing increase trend.  In 2015, Ningxia has the highest energy intensity of 273. 56 kg ce/1000 yuan, followed by Shanxi, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, and the energy intensity of industrial sector reached 1034. 28 kg ce/1000 yuan which was much higher than other regions in China.  Energy intensity of Beijing in 2015 is lowest among regions.  Energy intensity by sector of China's 30 regions in 2015 are shown in Table A. 3 in Appendix.  3. 2. 2. 2.  GDP.  The data for GDP and value-added of various sectors from 2000 to 2015 are converted to the 2000 constant price to eliminate the effect of inﬂation.  Compared with that of 2000, China's GDP in 2015 increased by 4. 08 times.  In general, Guangdong has the largest scale of GDP, while Ningxia has the lowest scale of GDP.  During 2000– 2015, average annual growth rate of GDP for each region exceed 10%, in which it reached 14. 79% in Inner Mongolia.  GDP of China's 30 regions are shown in Table A. 4 in Appendix.  3. 2. 2. 3.  Industrialization.  Industrial sector consumes large amount of fossil energy resource, and thus emits large amount of CO2.  Value-added of industrial sector affects CO2 emissions severely.  This study uses industrialization rate, i. e. , the ratio of industrial value-added to total GDP, to measure the change of industrial structure.  Industrialization rate of Heilongjiang and Tianjin are larger than other regions in China, whereas Hainan is the lowest during 2000–2015.  Due to the development of service sector, the share of industrial value-added in most regions declined in recent years.  Industrialization rate of China's 30 regions are shown in Table A. 5 in Appendix.  3. 2. 2. 4.  Urbanization.  Urbanization is the important factor to inﬂuence energy consumption and CO2 emissions because residential income and energy efﬁciency would improve in the process of urbanization.  This study employs the ratio of urban population to total population to measure the level of urbanization.  Generally, urbanization rate of China has been growing from 35. 50% in 2000 to 55. 44% in 2015.  Shanghai and Beijing are the two regions with highest urbanization rate of 88. 62% and 86. 42% in 2015, respectively.  However, urbanization rate in Guizhou remained 41. 01% in 2015.  Urbanization rate of China's 30 regions are shown in Table A. 6 in Appendix.  3. 2. 2. 5.  Population.  Since NBSC provides the data on year-end population in urban and rural area, this study takes the average of population at the beginning and end of the year.  Population in most regions increased slowly during 2000–2015, with an average annual growth rate of 0. 58%.  However, affected by labor transfer, growth rate of population reached 4. 33% in Tianjin, 3. 22% in Beijing and 2. 69% in Shanghai.  Notably, population in Anhui declined during 2000–2015.  Population of China's 30 regions are shown in Table A. 7 in Appendix.  3. 2. 2. 6.  Disposable income per capita.  As income rises, more energy resources are consumed to support the use of electrical appliances, and then more CO2 are emitted.  In this study, disposable income per capita by eliminating inﬂation is used to measure the real level of income.  During 2000–2015, most regions in China showed high-speed increase in disposable income per capita, with an average annual growth rate of 8. 85% in urban region and 8. 56% in rural region.  Shanghai and Beijing are two regions with highest disposable income per capita of both urban and rural residents.  However, Qinghai has lowest urban disposable income per capita and Gansu is the region with lowest rural disposable income per capita.  Urban and rural disposable income per capita of China's 30 regions are shown in Tables A. 8 and A. 9 in Appendix.  3. 3.  Overview of the national and regional CO2 emissions in China.  This section analyzes the performance of China's CO2 emissions at both national and regional levels.  First, the evolution trends of national CO2 emissions in China during 2000–2015 are investigated, and then the whole study period is divided into different time intervals in considering the evolution trends of national CO2 emissions.  Second, CO2 emissions of China's 30 regions and three big regions between 2000 and 2015 are compared.  3. 3. 1.  National CO2 emissions.  There has been a signiﬁcant increase in China's CO2 emissions from 3397. 62 million tons (Mt. ) in 2000 to 9403. 00 Mt.  in 2015 at an average annual growth rate of 7. 02%.  As shown in Fig.  1a, the changes in national CO2 emissions mainly runs through four stages.  high-speed growth stage (2000–2005), decreasing-speed growth stage (2006–2008), steady growth stage (2009–2012) and transition stage (2013–2015).  During 2000–2005, growth rate of national CO2 emissions increased from 4. 32% to 16. 90%, and national CO2 emissions showed a sharp increase, which was deﬁned as high-speed growth stage.  However, growth rate of national CO2 emissions declined signiﬁcantly from 2006 to 2008, and the time interval can be deﬁned as the decreasingspeed growth stage.  China experienced a steady increase in CO2 emissions during 2009–2012, and the growth rate remained between 5. 76% and 6. 65%, which was deﬁned as the steady growth stage.  During 2013–2015, growth rate of national CO2 emissions declined, and even became the negative value of −0. 87% in 2014 and −4. 09% in 2015.  This special stage was deﬁned as the transition stage, and was attributed to the transformation of economic development patterns.  In short, this division of growth stage helps to understand the evolution trends of national CO2 emissions, and also is the basis of conducting the temporal and spatial decomposition analysis of national and regional CO2 emissions in this study.  Share of CO2 emissions from fossil energy consumption or process remained largely unchanged during 2000–2015 (Fig.  1b).  During the whole study period, coal-related CO2 emissions accounted for a substantial part of 74. 50%–79. 50% in national CO2 emissions.  The high share of coal-related CO2 emissions was ascribed to the abundant coal resource reserve, coal-dominated energy structure and power structure in China (Ouyang and Lin, 2015.  Zhang et al. , 2016).  Share of oil-related CO2 emissions declined from 17. 63% to 11. 19% during 2000–2011, and rebounded during 2011–2015.  Share of CO2 emissions from industrial production process in national CO2 emissions were relatively small.  In general, gas-related CO2 emissions experienced an upward trend, in which CO2 emissions from the combustion of natural gas climbed from 1. 30% to 3. 22% during 2000–2015.  Fig.  1c shows the national CO2 emissions from different sectors during 2000–2015.  CO2 emissions in the power sector and manufacturing sector accounted for approximately 40% of national CO2 emissions, respectively, which were the two largest industrial CO2 emitters.  Transport sector was the third largest industrial CO2 emitter, and its share in national CO2 emissions ﬂuctuated slightly between 6. 00%–6. 82% during 2000–2015.  Share of CO2 emissions from urban residents showed a decline trend from 4. 24% in 2000 to 2. 20% 2015.  However, share of CO2 emissions from rural residents experienced an inverted U-shaped growth trend, increasing from 1. 52% in 2000 to 2. 96% in 2003 and declining to 1. 78% in 2015.  Except for a few years, share of CO2 emissions from urban residents were higher than that of rural residents during 2000–2015.  3. 3. 2.  Regional CO2 emissions.  CO2 emissions among China's 30 regions varied signiﬁcantly, seen in Fig.  2.  The top ten regions in term of CO2 emissions include Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Inner Mongolia, Henan, Liaoning, Shanxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Hubei.  Sum of CO2 emissions in these ten regions, on average, accounted for 58. 65% of national CO2 emissions during 2000– 2015.  Shandong province contributed most of 8. 75% to national CO2 emissions accumulatively during 2000–2015, followed by Hebei (7. 82%) and Jiangsu (6. 93%).  Energy-related CO2 emissions of some regions in China exceeded national energy-related CO2 emissions of some developed countries.  For example, CO2 emissions in Shandong (742. 32 Mt. ), Hebei (720. 77 Mt. ) and Jiangsu (647. 87 Mt. ) provinces in 2014 were higher than that of Canada (554. 80 Mt. ) and Australia (373. 80 Mt. ).  However, CO2 emissions in some regions, such as Qinghai and Hainan, accounted for a small part of less than 0. 5% in national CO2 emissions.  Such a big difference in CO2 emissions among regions lies in different socio-economic development condition, i. e. , the levels of economic development, industrialization, urbanization, population, and energy resources endowment.  Regions, such as Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Zhejiang emitted large amount of CO2 emissions, which were mainly attributed the high level of economic output, industrialization and urbanization.  Some regions, such as Inner Mongolia and Shanxi were less developed, but consumed massive fossil energy resource and induced large amount of CO2 emissions in developing the economy.  That was largely because these regions were abundant in energy resource and thus develop resource-based industrial structure.  In addition, CO2 emissions in Hebei and Henan provinces also accounted for a large proportion of national CO2 emissions because of the higher level of economic output and population.  A comparison of regional CO2 emissions in 2000 and in 2015 indicates that, CO2 emissions in most regions experienced a sharp increase during 2000–2015.  After China's joining into World Trade Organization, national and regional economy developed rapidly, and industrialization and urbanization were increasingly deepening.  Consequently, huge amount of fossil energy resource were consumed to support the rapid economic development, and induced massive CO2 emissions of the regions.  Resource-based regions showed most signiﬁcant increase in CO2 emissions during 2000–2015.  CO2 emissions in Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Xinjiang increased from 105. 95 Mt. , 58. 91 Mt.  and 65. 38 Mt.  in 2000 to 585. 71 Mt. , 272. 83 Mt.  and 243. 94 Mt.  in 2015, and corresponding average annual growth rate reached 12. 07%, 10. 76% and 9. 17%, respectively.  Coal-dominated energy structure and rapid development of resource-based industry drove to rapid increase in energy consumption and CO2 emissions of resource-based regions.  CO2 emissions in Hainan, Fujian and Shandong also increased considerably during 2000–2015.  In contrast, CO2 emissions increased slowly in most developed regions like Beijing, Shanghai and Taiwan, and the average annual growth rate of CO2 emissions in these regions during 2000–2015 were below 3. 50%.  On one hand, the developed regions had come into the post-industrial stage, and modern service industry was the primary engine of economic development.  On the other hand, large decline in coal consumption occurred in Beijing and Shanghai due to the transformation of energy development patterns and the adjustment of energy structure (Xu et al. , 2016).  When China's 30 regions are regrouped into three big regions, i. e. , eastern region, central region and western region, CO2 emissions at the three regions are also investigated.  The eastern region contributed most of 48. 96% to national CO2 emissions during 2000–2015, followed by central region of 33. 44% and western region of 17. 60%.  Provinces with larger CO2 emissions are mainly located in eastern region while provinces with lower CO2 emissions were largely in western region.  However, differences in CO2 emissions per capita among three big regions are relatively small, and the differences between eastern region and western region, eastern region and central region dropped from 32. 04% and 12. 47% in 2000 to 20. 32% and 5. 45% in 2015, respectively.  Considering the great differences in CO2 emissions among regions, Chinses government should pay more attention to regional CO2 emissions, and thus formulate differentiated emission-reduction policies at regional level in order to reduce China's CO2 emissions sharply.  4.  Results.  4. 1.  Temporal decomposition analysis.  The temporal decomposition analysis model is employed to analyze the underlying driving forces of national and regional energy-related CO2 emissions during 2000–2015.  This section decomposes the changes of CO2 emissions of each time interval (i. e. , 2000–2005, 2006–2008, 2009–2012 and 2013–20,015) to explore the main driving forces and discover the reasons behind of the changes.  4. 1. 1.  Temporal decomposition results of national CO2 emissions.  During 2000–2015, national energy-related CO2 emissions increased by 5828. 62 Mt. , a growth rate of 201. 67%.  The temporal decomposition results (see Table 3) revealed that economic scale effect (ΔC_A) was the dominant driving force that leads to the increase in national CO2 emissions while energy intensity effect in the production sector (ΔC_EGI) and energy structure effect (ΔC_ES) were the main factors to reduce national CO2 emissions, which was in line with an array of previous studies, such as S.  Xu et al.  (2014), X.  Xu et al.  (2014), Zhang and Da (2015), Wang et al.  (2015), Wang and Chao (2017).  Accumulative contribution of ΔC_A reached 9195. 62 Mt.  which accounted for 157. 77% of the change of national CO2 emissions, and contribution of ΔC_EGI and ΔC_ES were −4098. 44 Mt.  and − 1357. 73 Mt.  which accounted for −70. 32% and −23. 29% of the change of national CO2 emissions, respectively.  During 2000–2015, China's GDP increased by 3. 08 times, and massive energy were consumed to support it which induced large amount of CO2 emissions.  However, energy intensity decreased signiﬁcantly from 91. 73 kg ce/1000 yuan in 2000 to 58. 09 kg ce/1000 yuan in 2015, a growth rate of −36. 67%, which was mainly attributed to technology progress, capital-energy substitution and government polices (such as the phase-out and retirement of small-scale thermal power units and the elimination of backward production capacity) (Lin and Du, 2014.  Yang and Lin, 2016).  In addition, China has implemented strong policies to encourage gas to replace coal consumption in the industry and household sectors, and has used substantial subsidies to stimulate the deployment of non-fossil energy (Yang et al. , 2014.  Qi et al. , 2016).  During 2000–2015, the share of natural gas and renewable energy in energy consumption increased from 2. 20%, 73. 0% to 5. 90%, and 12. 00%, respectively, and the coal share decreased from 68. 50% to 64. 00% (CNBS).  The signiﬁcant improvement of energy structure in China in the past decades played an important role in restricting the increase in national CO2 emissions.  Industrial structure effect (ΔC_S), population scale effect (ΔC_P) and income improvement effect (ΔC_Y) were responsible for the increase in national CO2 emissions, and the corresponding proportion in the national CO2 emission change during 2000–2015 were 21. 51% (1253. 45 Mt. ), 10. 87% (633. 40 Mt. ) and 6. 48% (377. 60 Mt. ), respectively.  The improvement of disposal income and living standards in the household sector increased fossil energy consumption for cooking, warming and transportation.  During 2000–2015, energy consumption in the household sector increased by 2. 00 times, leading to the rapid increase in CO2 emissions.  Energy intensity effect in the household sector (ΔC_EYI) contributed to the reduction of national CO2 emissions, accounting for −3. 30% of the change of national CO2 emissions.  This result was supported by Dai et al.  (2012) and Qi et al.  (2016), because the spending on necessities (including energy) decreased with the growth of income.  While urbanization effect increased national CO2 emissions, accounting for 0. 30% of the change of national CO2 emissions.  The urbanization process promoted CO2 emissions by infrastructure construction, the development of industrial and transport sectors, population aggregation and the increasing residential energy consumption due to rural-to-urban migration (Li et al. , 2011.  Zi et al. , 2016.  Ouyang and Lin, 2015).  However, the two effects of the improvement of both energy intensity and of the urbanization played minor roles in the change of national CO2 emissions during 2000–2015.  During 2000–2005, 2006–2008 and 2009–2012, China has experienced the rapid growth of CO2 emissions, and the increase in CO2 emissions were 2372. 67 Mt. , 1544. 43 Mt. , and 2053. 92 Mt. , respectively.  In contrast, CO2 emissions of China decreased during 2013–2015, which was mainly attributed to the transition of economic development accompanying with the decrease in economic growth rate, signiﬁcant improvement of energy efﬁciency and major adjustment of energy structure.  Energy utilization efﬁciency in China was greatly improved during 2008–2015, and average annual contribution of energy intensity effect including ΔC_EGI and ΔC_EYI increased signiﬁcantly from −360. 62 Mt.  during 2009–2012 to −539. 78 Mt.  during 2013–2015.  The Chinese government took a series of measures to improve the energy utilization efﬁciency after 2005, including improving the energy efﬁciency standards and discouraging small energy-inefﬁcient units in the power plants, establishing fuel consumption limits, implementing vehicle emissions standards in the transport sector, establishing energy-efﬁcient design standards for commercial buildings in the service sector (Zhou et al. , 2010, 2014.  S.  Xu et al. , 2014.  X.  Xu et al. , 2014).  However, the average annual contribution of ΔC_A reduced from 838. 25 Mt.  during 2009– 2012 to 537. 53 Mt.  during 2013–2015.  Contributions of various driving forces showed an inverted-U shaped growth trend during the four time interval, and the properties of each driving factor remained unchanged except for industrial structure effect.  China was entering the postindustrial period along with decreasing share of industrial value-added and increasing share of value-added in service sector, ΔC_S turned from a positive driving force during the ﬁrst three sub-periods to a negative one (−84. 31 Mt. ) during 2013–2015.  4. 1. 2.  Temporal decomposition results of regional CO2 emissions.  Based on the temporal decomposition analysis model, CO2 emissions for each region are decomposed to reveal the main driving forces of the changes of regional CO2 emissions.  Accumulative contributions of various driving forces of CO2 emissions for each region are provided in Fig.  3.  Although the changes of both scale and increment of CO2 emissions among regions varied sharply during 2000–2014, the decomposition results indicated that the main driving forces of the changes of CO2 emissions of various regions were roughly same as the decomposition results at the national level.  Considering the increment of CO2 emissions, contributions of various driving forces, and emission-socioeconomic features, China's 30 regions were classiﬁed into 5 categories as follows.  The ﬁrst group includes ﬁve regions.  Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Anhui and Sichuan.  These ﬁve regions share the similar socioeconomic development characteristics (i. e. , large economic scale but low level of industrialization and urbanization and technology, and huge amount of population), and thus shows high level of ΔC_A, ΔC_S and ΔC_EGI, ΔC_U and ΔC_Y compared with other regions.  Rapid industrial development and large economic increment induced massive energy consumption and CO2 emissions in these regions during 2000–2014.  For example, ΔC_A reached 639. 70 Mt.  in Hebei province during 2000–2014, next to Shandong province (827. 69 Mt. ) and Jiangsu province (650. 10 Mt. ).  Henan province showed the largest ΔC_EGI of −256. 60 Mt.  among regions during 2000–2014, followed by Hebei province (−243. 55 Mt. ).  Low energy efﬁciency mainly due to low energy utilization technology left large room to improve it, which contributed to the reduction of CO2 emissions in these regions (Han et al. , 2016).  With rapid improvement of urbanization rate and resident income increased signiﬁcantly in Hebei and Anhui provinces.  ΔC_U in Hebei was the largest (2. 15 Mt. ) among regions during the study period, followed by Anhui (2. 13 Mt. ).  ΔC_P was positive in Hebei, Henan and Liaoning, while was negative in Sichuan and Anhui.  The second group is highly resource-based regions, including Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Xinjiang, Shaanxi and Ningxia.  ΔC_ES in Inner Mongolia reached −100. 51 Mt.  during 2000–2014, accounting for 21. 65% of the total change of CO2 emissions.  This was mainly attributed to the large-scale development and utilization of renewable energy in the last few years (Liu et al. , 2013.  Xin et al. , 2015).  ΔC_EGI was relatively large in Inner Mongolia (−219. 13 Mt. ), which was attributed to eliminate backward production facilities, construct major energysaving project etc.  (NDRC, 2011).  ΔC_S in Inner Mongolia was positive and largest (133. 48 Mt. ) among regions.  Accumulative ΔC_EGI was positive in Xinjiang (59. 01 Mt. ) during 2000–2014 because the rapid development of industry sector in the context of Western Development strategy increased the energy intensity of industry sector (Guo et al. , 2016.  Wang et al. , 2017).  The third group includes four regions with highly developed and large scale of economy, i. e. , Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Zhejiang.  The most outstanding feature was the large ΔC_A andin these four regions.  Shandong had largest ΔC_A of 827. 69 Mt.  and ΔC_EGI of −407. 77 Mt.  As the largest CO2 emitter among regions, Shandong province have been focusing on improving energy efﬁciency since 11th Five-Year planning.  Central government and Shandong provincial government shut down large number of thermal power units and cement enterprises with small scale or backward production capacity, and provided ﬁnancial support and implemented resource tax and value-added tax to promote the research and development of new energy-saving technology.  However, because of the large economic output and much higher growth rate of economy the increase in CO2 emissions in Shandong during 2000–2014 reached 566. 56 Mt. , which ranked the ﬁrst among regions.  Additionally, ΔC_P in these four regions played a greater effect on the increase in CO2 emissions compared with other regions.  The key reason for this increase was the transformation of the surplus labor forces from economically underdeveloped regions in the west and northwest to developed coastal regions in the east.  Especially in Guangdong province, ΔC_P reached the maximum of 79. 17 Mt.  among regions because of the signiﬁcant increase in population of 20. 88 million persons during 2000–2014.  The forth group includes the four regions in China, i. e. , Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing.  These regions were the most developed areas in China but had little contribution to national CO2 emissions, which was attributed high contribution of ΔC_EGI and ΔC_ES.  Contribution of ΔC_EGI and ΔC_ES during 2000–2014 reached −308. 68% and −246. 90% in Beijing and −160. 19%, −183. 43% in Shanghai, respectively, which effectively restrained the growth of CO2 emissions.  Beijing and Shanghai had greater service sector, and the average contributions of service sector to regional GDP reached 63. 08% in Beijing and 53. 38% in Shanghai.  Beijing has made great effort to eliminate backward production capacity and industrial enterprises and old vehicles with high pollution and energy consumption, and introduced advanced energy-saving technology during 2000–2014.  In addition, after the startup of “coal to clean energy” project since 2001 and the increase in share of purchased power, the coal consumption in Beijing sharply decreased.  Except the traditional energy-saving and emission reduction measures, Shanghai also focused on starting key energy-saving project and building energy-saving.  ΔC_EGI and ΔC_ES also substantially reduced CO2 emissions in Tianjin and Chongqing during 2000–2014.  ΔC_A in these four regions were relatively small compared with the ﬁrst three groups.  The remaining regions belong to the last group.  These regions are located in the northwest and southwest of China, and are less undeveloped regions in China.  The change of CO2 emissions for each region in this group was relatively small.  Less developed socio-economic development condition resulted in relatively small ΔC_A, ΔC_EGI, ΔC_EYI and ΔC_ES.  ΔC_P in these regions was also small because the labor force transferred from these regions to the developed regions.  ΔC_EGI during 2013–2014 played a greater effect on the CO2 emissions than the other time intervals.  During 2013–2014, ΔC_EGI reduced CO2 emissions in Shandong province by 96. 82 Mt.  annually, higher than that of 55. 81 Mt.  during 2009–2012, 31. 47 Mt.  during 2006–2008, respectively.  Notably, ΔC_EGI were positive in some regions like Shandong, Hebei and Shanxi during 2000–2005, which was related to the increasing proportion of the value-added of industry sector in GDP.  Similarly, EYI were positive in some regions during 2006–2008 due to the increasing expenditure on energy consumption, and the average annual EYI showed an increasing trend among regions during 2006–2014.  However, EYI in Hebei province was positive during 2013–2014, which was related to the increase in the expenditure on energy consumption of rural sector.  Contributions by time interval of various driving forces on CO2 emissions for each region are provided in Fig.  4.  In terms of the changes of CO2 emissions at different time intervals, ΔC_ES in most regions were positive during 2000–2005.  The key reason was that the coal consumption among regions increased signiﬁcantly, and the national average share of coal consumption in total energy consumption increased from 68. 50% in 2000 to 72. 40% in 2005 (China's National Bureau of Statistics, 2000).  For example, the share of coal consumption in Shandong and Hebei increased from 52. 61%, 78. 44% in 2000 to 66. 34%, and 81. 03% in 2005, the effects of energy structure degradation reached 338. 84 Mt.  and 213. 14 Mt.  during 2000–2005, respectively.  However, along with the large-scale development of renewable energy since 2006 and the deployment of a series of energy-saving and emissionreduction policies, the energy structure improved signiﬁcantly among regions during 2006–2014.  Especially in Liaoning during 2009–2012, energy structure effect reached the largest value of −107. 80 Mt.  among regions.  ΔC_S played a signiﬁcant role in promoting the increase in CO2 emissions among regions during 2000–2008.  However, with the rapid development of service sector in developed regions, ΔC_S turned to be negative during 2009–2012.  Ultimately, ΔC_S were negative during 2013–2014 except some less developed regions, such as Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi and Guizhou.  Obviously, industry sector would be the major source to regional economic development in these less developed regions.  ΔC_U had an inverted U-shaped evolution trends during the four time intervals, in most regions, which was consistent with the previous studies, such as Zi et al.  (2016).  After living in urban areas, the rural households used fossil fuels instead of bioenergy for cooking and boiling water (Parikh and Shukla, 1995), and the private transportation also developed rapidly, which required more gasoline and diesel (Jones, 2004).  However, urbanization could also reduce residential direct energy demand by promoting the utilization of efﬁcient appliances, central heating systems, and fuel-efﬁcient transportation (Ma, 2015.  Zang et al. , 2017).  ΔC_U in highly developed regions such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin were always negative during 2000–2014.  However, in Jiangsu province and some less developed regions, ΔC_U was positive and decreasing.  ΔC_A in most regions showed a decreasing trend during the four time intervals.  The decreasing growth rate of economy among regions resulted from the adjustment of economic structure, and another possible reason was that China's economic growth was close to its steady state according to Solow model (Song et al. , 2011).  However, ΔC_P was decreasing in most regions during the four time intervals.  This was attributed to the one-child policy implemented in China, which decreased the growth rate of population in various regions.  However, ΔC_P in most developed regions showed a growing trend due to labor transfer from less develop regions to the developed regions.  For example, the average annual contribution of ΔC_P increased from 2. 9 Mt.  during 2000–2005 to 11. 18 Mt.  during 2009–2012.  Generally, ΔC_Y was decreasing in most regions during the four time intervals due to decreasing expenditure on fossil energy.  However, the average annual contribution of ΔC_Y in Xinjiang increased from 0. 55 Mt.  during 2009–2012 to 0. 77 Mt.  during 2013–2014, which indicated that the improvement of income promoted the fossil energy consumption in household sector.  4. 1. 3.  Temporal decomposition results of CO2 emissions in three big regions.  As shown in Fig.  5, temporal decomposition of the changes of CO2 emissions indicate that strong similarities of contribution of variables exist in three big regions.  Contribution degree of various variables, including direction and magnitude, between eastern region and central region are roughly same.  In eastern and central regions, contribution of ΔC_A during 2000–2014 are −66. 65% and −66. 66%, respectively, and contribution of ΔC_ES are −25. 45% and −22. 57%, respectively.  Economic growth and energy structure adjustment in western region contributed less to national CO2 emissions than that in eastern and central regions.  However, contribution of ΔC_P in eastern region (14. 58%) is far greater than that of central region (6. 87%) and western region (4. 89%) because labor transfer from central region and western region to eastern region resulted in rapid population growth in eastern region.  ΔC_Y and ΔC_EYI in western region contributed a larger part to its CO2 emissions compared with the eastern region and central region.  In addition, absolute effects of various variables vary signiﬁcantly, and CO2 emissions and the effects of variables in eastern region are larger than the level of central region and western region.  However, ΔC_A, ΔC_EGI and ΔC_ES differed greatly among the three regions during four study period.  During 2000–2005, ΔC_ES is 1246. 32 Mt.  in eastern region, larger than that of 740. 40 Mt.  in central region and 385. 95 Mt.  in western region.  In addition, ΔC_A in eastern region (1087. 75 Mt. ) is also greater than the level of central region (742. 25 Mt. ) and western region (329. 18 Mt. ).  However, contribution degrees of ΔC_A, ΔC_EGI and ΔC_ES in three regions are still similar during the study period.  4. 2.  Spatial decomposition analysis.  The M-R spatial decomposition model is adopted to analyze the differences in energy-related CO2 emissions among regions during 2000–2014.  This section decomposes the differences in energy-related CO2 emissions between China's 30 regions, three big regions and the national average into nine kinds of effects of driving forces.  The possible potential of emission-reduction of various regions is evaluated.  4. 2. 1.  Spatial decomposition results of China's 30 regions.  CO2 emissions of China's 30 regions in 2000, 2005, 2008, 2012, and 2014 are sorted from big to small, and the corresponding group average CO2 emissions are calculated (seen Table A. 11).  In this study, the national average CO2 emissions are given by arithmetic average CO2 emissions of China's 30 regions.  Then we compare the CO2 emissions of each region with the national average CO2 emissions.  The differences of the CO2 emissions in 2000, 2005, 2008, 2012, and 2014 are decomposed into eight driving forces (excluding ΔC_CI) by applying M-R spatial decomposition analysis model, and the effect of each driving forces is calculated based on Eqs.  (13)–(21).  The positive or negative value of the effects of different factors has different meanings.  For example, economic output (GDP) is size-dependent, positive value of economic scale effect indicates the GDP of a region is higher than the national average, while the positive value of energy intensity effect indicates that the region is less efﬁcient in energy use than national average level.  The spatial decomposition results (Fig.  5) show that ΔC_A and ΔC_EGI were the major driving forces of the differences in CO2 emissions between the regions and the national average, while ΔC_ES and ΔC_S were also important factors responsible for the differences in CO2 emissions between regions and the national average.  Other factors, such as ΔC_Y, ΔC_Y, ΔC_U and ΔC_EYI, had minor effects on the differences in regional CO2 emissions.  Shandong, Jiangsu and Guangdong had the largest ΔC_A.  The GDP of these three regions were highly greater than the national average level, and thus consumed larger energy resource and emitted mount of CO2 than the average.  For example, ΔC_A in Shandong province reached 474. 03 Mt.  in 2014, which was equivalent to 106. 62% of the difference in CO2 emissions between Shandong and the national average (444. 60 Mt. ).  Yet GDP in regions like Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Gansu, Guizhou and Shanxi were considerably smaller than national average level, which resulted in the larger and negative effect of economicThe highly resource-based regions, such as Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Ningxia, had great higher ΔC_EGI than the national average.  Shan et al.  (2016) revealed that Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia were important base of coal production in China, with many large coal mines, and high energy production and consumption and less developed technological level, which caused low energy efﬁciency and thus high energy consumption and CO2 emissions in these regions.  For example, ΔC_EGI in Shanxi province was 500. 72 Mt.  That meant that higher energy intensity (or low energy efﬁciency) in Shanxi province resulted in the higher CO2 emissions of 500. 72 Mt.  than the national level.  That is, CO2 emissions in Shanxi province would reduce by 500. 72 Mt.  if the energy efﬁciency rises to the national average level.  In contrast, energy intensity in economically developed eastern coastal regions including Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang and Fujian were far blew the national average level, and ΔC_EGI in these regions were negative and sharply lower than the national average.  ΔC_ES indicated the effect of the differences in economic structure among regions, and it would increase if contribution of industrial (or heavy industrial) value-added went up.  Highly developed or undeveloped regions had larger but negative ΔC_ES compared with the national average.  The contribution of service sector on regional GDP were higher than that of industry sector in socio-economic developed regions such as Beijing and Shanghai, while in highly undeveloped west regions in China agriculture sector contributed a large part to regional GDP.  For example, ΔC_ES in Beijing was −113. 30 Mt.  in 2014, which revealed that low carbon energy structure in Beijing reduced CO2 emissions by 113. 30 Mt.  in 2014 than the national level.  The differences of CO2 emissions between the regions and the national average cause by ΔC_P, ΔC_U and ΔC_Y were small.  The key reason for this was that the CO2 emissions from household sector accounted for a relatively small part of regional CO2 emissions.  When investigating the trends of the differences in CO2 emissions between among regions and the driving forces resulting in the differences, we ﬁnd the differences in both CO2 emissions and the effects of various factors were growing during 2000–2014.  For example, the gap of CO2 emissions between Shandong province and the national average level increased from 76. 10 Mt.  in 2000 to 444. 60 Mt.  in 2014 while the gap of CO2 emissions between Qinghai province and the national average level increased from −87. 99 Mt.  in 2000 to −254. 67 Mt.  in 2014.  Due to the adjustment of industrial structure and improvement of energy efﬁciency, the energy intensity decreased from 70. 34 kg ce/1000 yuan to 31. 72 kg ce/1000 yuan, and the gap of CO2 emissions caused by ΔC_EGI between Beijing and the national average increased from −13. 50 Mt.  in 2000 to −66. 46 Mt.  in 2014.  This founding revealed the increasing differences in socio-economic development (such as economic development, energy structure and income improvement) among China's 30 regions.  4. 2. 2.  Performance ranking.  In order to investigate the social-economic development status and the potential of emission-reduction regions of China's 30 regions, this section ranks the effects of various driving forces of each region from big to small.  Actually, this ranking is the comparison of economic output, energy efﬁciency or income improvement.  For example, the smaller number of ΔC_A means the higher economic output while the smaller number of energy intensity effect indicates the lower energy efﬁciency of the regions.  Ang (2015) also pointed out that the factors of the regions ranked at the top of the list (such as larger positive value of energy intensity effect or industrial structure effect of some regions) have potential of higher energy-saving or emission-reduction if proper measures (such as industrial structure adjustment or energy efﬁciency improvement) are taken.  Combing Fig.  6 and Table 5, the emission-reduction potential of China's 30 regions in future can be evaluated and the directions of policy implementation were also provided.  The smaller number of regions revealed greater emission-reduction potential, and government should take efﬁcient measures to reduce CO2 emissions of these regions.  For example, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang ranked in the top three in terms of ΔC_EGI in 2014, which indicated that energy efﬁciency could be improved and CO2 emissions could also be reduced signiﬁcantly in the three regions.  In addition, some less developed regions such as Guizhou and Hebei shows greater emission-reduction potential in terms of ΔC_EGI.  However, Guangdong, Shandong, Heilongjiang and Jiangsu provinces ranked in the top four regions in terms of ΔC_S, which showed the signiﬁcant potential of emission-reduction by optimizing the economic structure in these regions.  Chinese government should put emphasis on the quality of economic development in high-scale economic output regions such as Shandong, Jiangsu and Guangdong.  In addition, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Beijing ranked in the top three in terms of ΔC_Y.  It indicated the higher energy consumption and CO2 emissions due to the improvement of income, which left large room to reduce the CO2 emissions by guiding the consumption of lowcarbon energy.  4. 2. 3.  Spatial decomposition results of three big regions.  In this study, M-R spatial decomposition method is also employed to explore the factors responsible for the differences among three big regions of China.  As shown in Fig.  7, ΔC_EGI was negative in eastern region but was positive in central and western regions, indicating that eastern region had a higher energy efﬁciency than central and western regions.  In contrast, ΔC_A was positive in eastern region and was negative in central and western regions, which showed the larger CO2 emissions due to economic output in eastern region.  Obviously, ΔC_A and ΔC_EGI were the most signiﬁcant driving forces of the differences in CO2 emissions among the three regions.  In 2014, ΔC_A resulted in a higher CO2 emissions of 1393. 80 Mt.  in eastern region than the average, while induced a lower CO2 emissions of 1182. 48 Mt.  in western region than the average.  In addition, effects of each driving force showed an increasing trend.  Generally, western and central regions share the similar characteristic of leading to the lower CO2 emissions than the eastern region.  The negative ΔC_A is the dominant driving force leading to lower CO2 emissions in central and western regions, while the positive ΔC_EGI is an important factors increasing CO2 emissions of the two regions.  ΔC_ES and ΔC_S also become the important driving force affecting the differences in CO2 emissions between central, western regions and eastern region in 2014,and it revealed the widening gap in energy structure and industrial structure among regions.  <Conclusion> Discussion.  The main conclusions which emerges from the present study is that the impact of economic output, energy intensity, energy structure and industrial structure on national and regional CO2 emissions is quite large.  Combined effects of these four factors determine the variations of national and regional CO2 emissions from the perspective of temporal and spatial dimension.  Based on the above empirical analysis in Section 4, we make a further discussion on two issues.  (1) What are the deep-rooted reasons of the four factors with larger effect on China's CO2 emissions.  (2) How about the future tendency of contribution of various factors to China's CO2 emissions.  5. 1.  Effects of key factors on China's CO2 emissions.  Main contribution to China's CO2 emissions are from production sectors, which accounted for approximately 95. 57% of national CO2 emissions during the whole study period.  The key factors are all involved in production activity, which is the direct reason of the large effects on CO2 emissions.  However, the deep-rooted reasons are as follows.  (1) Production activity would result in energy consumption where energy is combusted to support the operation of machinery equipment and is put into production as material.  Production activity is the direct factor of energy consumption and CO2 emissions, and the differences in economic output among China’30 regions led to the signiﬁcant differences in CO2 emissions.  Various regions of China experienced a rapid increase in economic output, which induced the signiﬁcant increase in CO2 emissions among regions.  Therefore, production activity is the dominated factors responsible for the variations of CO2 emissions from the perspective of temporal and spatial dimension.  (2) Other three factors of energy intensity, energy structure and industrial structure, to some extent, also have a greater effect on regional energy consumption and CO2 emissions.  Due to the large differences in energy efﬁciency, energy structure and industrial structure of China's 30 regions, effects of the three factors on CO2 emissions among regions varied sharply.  Three factors of China's 30 regions changed rapidly along with socialeconomic development during 2000–2015, and thus resulted in large effects on CO2 emissions.  5. 2.  The future trend of the contribution of key factors.  The future trend of the effects of key factors are discussed, and the main ﬁndings are as follows.  (1) The effect of economic growth would decrease in the expected future along with the decline in economic growth of most regions in China.  Total CO2 emissions in regions are mainly determined by real economic output, while contribution or the increment of CO2 emissions among regions lies in growth rate of economic output.  According to China's economic development planning, the absolute contribution of economic scale would decline increasingly.  However, the contribution degree or relative contribution would increase because of the rapid adjustment of energy structure and industrial structure, which is supported by empirical results of China's developed regions with cleanenergy-dominated energy structure and service-dominated industrial structure in this study.  (2) Both effect of energy intensity improvement and contribution degree would increase in the expected future.  This is mainly because China have paid more attention to energy efﬁciency improvement since 2008, and have strengthened the scientiﬁc research investment, introduced new energy-saving and low carbon technology to reduce national and regional CO2 emissions.  Along with the increase of the pressure of emission-reduction due to tighter emission allowances, cleaner production technology would be widely employed to production process.  In addition, the investment of cleaner production technology in the early stage would play a greater effect on emission-reduction because employees need to spend time on understanding how to operate, maintain and exclude small faults a new production facility when introduced.
