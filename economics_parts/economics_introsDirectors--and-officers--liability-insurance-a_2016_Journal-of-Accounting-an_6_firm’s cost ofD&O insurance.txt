Private enforcement via shareholder litigation is important to investor protection and stock market development
(La Porta Name, 2006).  Prior literature suggests that cross-country variation in shareholder litigation threat affects the cost of
equity (Hail and Leuz, 2009; Khurana and Raman, 2004).  However, there is relatively scant evidence on how firm-level
mechanisms affect the disciplining role of shareholder litigation and therefore the cost of equity.  This research question is
important as the cost of equity is a summary measure of how investors perceive the risk and return tradeoff of investing in a
firm (Francis Name, 2004).  In addition, the cost of equity plays a key role in corporate financing and capital budgeting
decisions.  In this study, we examine how directors' and officers' liability insurance (D&O insurance) affects a firmâ€™s cost ofD&O insurance is a policy purchased by a firm to cover defense cost and potential damage award when its directors and
officers (D&Os) are sued.  By effectively shielding D&Os from bearing personal financial liabilities, D&O insurance reduces the
disciplining effect of shareholder litigation (Baker and Griffith, 2010).
