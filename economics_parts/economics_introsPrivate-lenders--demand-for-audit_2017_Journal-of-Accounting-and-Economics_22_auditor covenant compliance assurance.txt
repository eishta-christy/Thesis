Accounting covenants are widely used in private lending agreements to mitigate conﬂicts of interest between shareholders and lenders.  These covenants increase contracting eﬃciency by providing the basis for the optimal allocation of control 
rights when contracts are incomplete ( Watts and Zimmerman, 1986; Roberts and Suﬁ, 2009a; Christensen and Nikolaev,

agreements under GAAP.  In particular, accounting and auditing standards require auditors to conﬁrm the going concern assumption and to ensure the appropriate classiﬁcation of debt as current or non-current, which entails checking covenant 
compliance.  In addition to these standard obligations to verify compliance, however, auditors may offer a letter providing 
speciﬁc negative assurance directly to lenders by certifying that they have no knowledge of any default.  What is unclear 
is whether this additional covenant compliance assurance occurs at random, or whether it can be explained by eﬃcient 
contracting.  To date, the literature has been largely silent on the conditions under which lenders seek such assurance from 
auditors.  We seek to address this question in this paper.  
The fact that auditors report on borrowers’ covenant compliance directly to lenders may be economically important 
because of its effects on auditor liability.  Under the GAAP regime, auditors are not liable to lenders because lenders are 
regarded as non-contractual third parties to standard audit arrangements.  Nevertheless, auditors may become liable to third 
parties depending on whether auditors are aware that ﬁnancial statements are to be used for particular purposes by known 
parties, and whether there is any conduct by the auditors linking them to third parties ( Feinman, 2015 ).  Because they require 
auditors to write to lenders to state they have no knowledge of any defaults on the covenants, auditor covenant compliance 
assurance clauses are likely to extend auditors’ liability to lenders, even though there is no contract between them.  This is 
because it will be more diﬃcult for auditors to convince a court that they were not aware who they were reporting to and 
what their reports were to be used for.  
We present novel descriptive evidence of auditors providing assurance to private lenders of borrowers’ compliance with 
accounting covenants.  If the standard GAAP regime is suﬃcient for lenders’ needs, we do not expect to observe systematic associations between lenders’ audit demands and borrower or loan characteristics.  According to agency theory and the 
theory of incomplete contracting, information asymmetries and contracting eﬃciency should drive observed variation in 
lenders’ demand for additional assurance.  Agency theory predicts that covenants appear in debt contracts to reduce conﬂicts of interest between providers of equity and providers of debt ( Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Smith and Warner, 1979 ).  
More recent insights based on the theory of incomplete contracting view accounting information as part of an eﬃcient contracting regime, where ﬁnancial covenants represent the contingency for the allocation of control rights ( Christensen Name, 
2016 ).  We draw on these arguments and predict that lenders will demand auditor assurance of covenant compliance in an 
attempt to reduce agency problems and to enhance contracting eﬃciency.  Such assurance involves reporting speciﬁcally to 
lenders on borrowers’ compliance with the chosen set of contractual accounting deﬁnitions ( Li, 2010 ).  To test our predictions, we conduct a cross-sectional analysis of auditor covenant compliance clauses, using a large sample of private lending 
agreements retrieved from the SEC EDGAR archives for the period 1996 to 2012.  
Around 35% of the 6,513 loan agreements in our sample are identiﬁed as containing an auditor covenant compliance 
assurance (CCA) clause.  After adjusting for the total number of ﬁnancial covenants in loan agreements, the use of CCA 
clauses is comparatively stable over our sample period.
