This paper examines whether the quality of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) is higher when the acquiring firm and
target firm share the same external auditor. 1 Our intuition is that the acquisition process often involves considerable
uncertainty, including information asymmetry between bidders and targets regarding their operations, financial health, risk
and prospects as well as uncertainty related to post-acquisition operational synergies.  This uncertainty can negatively
impact M&A quality by reducing managers' ability to identify the most profitable investment projects (Goodman Name,
2014).  We argue that when an acquirer and target share a common auditor, the auditor can help reduce uncertainty along
several dimensions. 
First, auditors accumulate a considerable amount of information about their clients through conducting their audit
procedures and through informal discussions with top management, allowing them to be helpful as information
intermediaries both before the M&A (e. g. , identifying potential merger counterparties and assisting with due diligence) and
after the M&A (e. g. , integrating accounting systems and internal controls). 
Second, since each audit firm has its own unique style of interpreting and implementing accounting rules (Kothari Name,
2010), firms represented by a common auditor are likely to have more comparable financial statements (Francis Name, 2014),
which leads to a reduction in uncertainty (De Franco Name, 2011).  That is, a merging firm can better understand the
assumptions and choices underlying accounting numbers in financial statements from other firms that share the same
auditor.  In turn, this leads to a better understanding (i. e. , reduced uncertainty) of those firms' economics, as compared to
those of firms using different auditors. 
Finally, common auditors may be more likely to limit misreporting that asymmetrically benefits one party over the other. 
Prior research indicates that acquirers (Louis, 2004; Gong Name, 2008) and targets (Anilowski Name, 2009) manage earnings
before M&As.  Thus, auditors that audit both the acquirer and target face greater litigation risk, as the common auditor may
be sued for earnings management undertaken by either party.  Moreover, common auditors likely face greater scrutiny by
stakeholders, given the potential for conflicts of interest.  As Agrawal Name (2013) show, deals with common M&A advisors
attract securities class action lawsuits with greater frequency than deals with separate advisors.  Thus, a common auditor has
arguably higher incentives to limit misreporting ex ante, leading to reduced uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the
reported numbers.  By reducing uncertainty during the M&A process, common auditors can help firms allocate capital more
efficiently, resulting in higher quality acquisitions. 
To test whether common auditors are associated with higher quality M&As, we use a sample of 1971 U. S.  acquisitions
between 1988 and 2010, where both the acquirer and the target are public firms and the acquirer obtains complete control
of the target after the acquisition.  To capture M&A quality, we use the acquisition announcement return following a large
body of research (e. g. , Asquith Name, 1983; Bradley Name, 1988; Cai and Sevilir, 2012; Agrawal Name, 2013; Goodman Name,We find that M&As involving firms with a common auditor are of higher quality than M&As involving firms with
different auditors. 2 Further, we test and find that the common-auditor effect is stronger when there is greater preacquisition uncertainty, proxied by targets with higher growth, more volatility, greater research and development (R&D)
intensity, and larger bid–ask spreads.  Our results are robust to the inclusion of numerous control variables for auditor, firm
and deal characteristics, the merging firms' previous business relationships and geographical proximity, the existence of
shared M&A advisors and/or directors, and additional testing to address endogeneity concerns related to auditor selection. 
Collectively, these results are consistent with common auditors reducing uncertainty during the M&A process, which leads
to higher quality M&As. 
To get a sense of the economic magnitude of the common auditor effect, consider that the announcement period
abnormal returns are 1. 064% points higher in common-auditor deals than those in non-common-auditor deals.  Given that
the average market capitalization of an acquirer (target) in our sample is $8. 99 billion ($870 million), this difference in
announcement returns translates into an increase in the combined firm's market capitalization of $104. 9 million. 3
We then examine the three mechanisms (discussed above) through which common auditors reduce M&A uncertainty:
(1) discussions with the M&A parties, (2) financial statement comparability, and (3) limited misreporting.  With respect to
the first mechanism, we employ two different empirical approaches.  First, we show that the common-auditor effect is larger
when the acquirer and target use the same local office of the common auditor, as the auditor can more easily facilitate
discussions between these clients if they are all in the same location.  Second, we show that there is an increased probability
of an M&A for firms with a common auditor, as the auditor can both better match clients interested in engaging in M&A
deals and reduce uncertainties throughout the process that might otherwise derail the deal. 
To explore the second mechanism, i. e. , financial statement comparability, we examine whether firms in common-auditor
deals have more comparable financial statements than do firms in non-common-auditor deals.  Using differences in yearspecific total accruals (Francis Name, 2014) and the covariance of earnings across time (Barth Name, 2012; De Franco Name,
2011; Lang Name, 2010) as proxies for comparability, we find that acquirers and targets with common auditors have more
comparable financial statements than do those with different auditors. 
We also find less misreporting for common-auditor mergers, the third mechanism, using performance-matched
abnormal accruals (Kothari Name, 2005) and financial statement restatements (Bens Name, 2012) as proxies for misreporting. 
Combined, these results support our inferences that common auditors reduce uncertainty in the M&A process by improving
(public and private) communication channels. 
Finally, we examine whether the common-auditor effect is mitigated after the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX).  Section 201 of
SOX prohibits auditors from engaging in non-audit services, such as M&A advisory and consulting services.  To the extent
auditors were engaged in non-audit services before SOX and common auditors used these services to help their clients
engage in better acquisitions, the common-auditor effect should be mitigated post-SOX.  However, we find that the
common-auditor effect remains after SOX.  This result suggests that the role of common auditors in reducing uncertainty is
unlikely driven by non-audit function communications. 
An important caveat to our findings is that, despite all our empirical analyses, discussions between auditors and their
clients are unobservable.  Thus, we cannot directly speak to the amount or type of information provided by common auditors
during M&As.  Given that American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Rule 301 prohibits disclosure of
confidential
information without consent from the client, if auditor discussions do indeed contain relevant private
information, it should be approved by the appropriate parties; that said, we recognize that there is potential for conflicts
of interest to arise.  We leave this for future research and regulators to determine. 4
Our study makes several important contributions.  First, we add to the literature that examines the role of auditors in
M&As.  Prior studies generally examine the roles of acquirer auditors and target auditors separately.  For example, Louis
(2005) studies the role of acquirer auditors in M&A transactions and finds higher acquisition announcement returns for nonBig 4 firms, while other studies find that targets with Big 4 auditors are more likely to get acquired (Xie Name, 2013) and have
greater acquisition synergy and higher acquirer announcement returns (Golubov Name, 2012).  In this study, we consider both
acquirer auditors and target auditors in examining how sharing an auditor influences acquisition performance, providing
new insights into the role of auditors in M&As. 
Second, our paper contributes to the emerging literature on the real effects of accounting and auditing.  In particular,
prior research finds that accounting information facilitates more efficient corporate investment by reducing agency
problems caused by information asymmetry (e. g. , Biddle Name, 2009; Biddle and Hilary, 2006), by providing peer firms with
more information (e. g. , Badertscher Name, 2013), and by providing information to managers within the firm (Shroff, 2014;
McNichols and Stubben, 2008).  In addition, Kausar Name (2014) show that firms' choice to obtain an audit helps lower
information asymmetry and leads to more efficient investment.  We contribute to this line of research by showing that
common auditors reduce uncertainty in the M&A process, and thus improve M&A quality. 
Third, we contribute to the large literature examining the effect of sharing an agent on economic outcomes.  For example,
the economics literature analyzes the use of a common agent as a way for competitors to achieve implicit collusion (e. g. ,
Bernheim and Whinston, 1985; Gal-Or, 1985, 1986; Vives, 1990).  In this setting, a common agent behaves passively and
information transfers among competitors can be widely observed.  In contrast, Villas-Boas (1994) and Gardiner Name (2007)
consider a setting where a common agent can act strategically, and examine conflicts that arise from sharing the same
advertising agency and sharing the same real estate agent.  More closely related to our study, Agrawal Name (2013) examine
the role of common investment bank advisors in M&As, and find that such deals are somewhat better for acquirers than they
are for targets.  Similarly, Cai and Sevilir (2012) find that board connections favor the acquirer, but the manner of benefit is a
function of the type of board connection.  We contribute to this literature by providing evidence on the impact of sharing an
auditor on M&A outcomes as well as the mechanisms through which these outcomes manifest. 
Finally, our study complements concurrent work by Dhaliwal Name (2015), who also examine the role of common
auditors in M&A transactions.  Our study delves into the mechanisms through which common auditors affect M&A
outcomes.  We find evidence consistent with the common auditor resolving information uncertainty between the parties in
the transaction.  Dhaliwal Name (2015) examine whether one party reaps greater benefits from the deals and find evidence
consistent with the acquirer capturing the benefits, as indicated by higher acquirer event returns.  In addition, Dhaliwal Name's study suggests that target firm shareholders may be worse off because target event returns and deal premiums are
lower.  While Dhaliwal Name's wealth transfer result is certainly interesting, we find that the overall combined
announcement return is positive.  We caution, however, that the studies use somewhat different samples and tests, and
thus the results cannot be fully interpreted together.  We leave it to future research to further examine the various aspects
and consequences of a common auditor in M&A transactions. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.  In Section 2, we discuss the M&A process as well as how a common auditor
can help reduce uncertainties in that process.  Section 3 describes the sample selection process, and Section 4 details the
research design and empirical results.  We present additional analyses in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6. 
2.  Motivation
Mergers and acquisitions represent significant corporate events that involve a thorough and dynamic process that can
vary from several months to several years to complete.  In general, the M&A process starts with the identification of potential
target candidates, which is a function of the firm's strategic objectives and requires some preliminary screening of the
candidates.  After a candidate is chosen, the firm engages in a lengthy due diligence process, which includes developing an
extensive understanding of the target value as a stand-alone business as well as the value of potential synergies (Copeland
Name, 2000).  As GE Capital (2012) indicates,
“Due diligence is not a courtship, a negotiation, or an inquisition; it's a fact-finding mission…[y]our business review of
the target becomes a true audit, aimed at gaining a thorough understanding of the target's operations, assets,
liabilities, and outlook.  Your due diligence team will be looking to confirm the target's representations, validate its
valuation, probe any legal, regulatory and compliance concerns, and affirm expected synergies and integration plans. ”
After obtaining considerable information through the due diligence phase, negotiations begin between the acquirer and target
regarding the acquisition price, the deal structure, etc.  When the negotiations are done and the deal is complete, the firms enter the
final phase—the integration of the two firms.  There are numerous factors for the acquiring firm to consider during the integration
phase, such as the development and articulation of the vision for the new entity to employees and other stakeholders, legal and tax
issues, human resource issues (e. g. , employee retention/severance), and fixed asset allocations.  Further, underlying all of these
factors is the integration of the accounting information systems to capture these economic changes. 
As becomes apparent through the above discussion of the M&A process, each phase contains significant uncertainty. 
From identifying merger partners to conducting due diligence to valuing and negotiating the deal to post-M&A integration,
managers face uncertainty throughout the process and its negative impact on firm value.  In particular, extant research
indicates that uncertainty negatively affects acquirer announcement returns and post-acquisition performance (McNichols
and Stubben, 2015; Erickson Name, 2012) and that having more firm-specific target information helps improve acquirer
returns and the expected value of combined firms (Martin and Shalev, 2009).  Given that M&As are typically large and
important corporate transactions, managerial incentives are strong to combat adverse selection inherent in the identification and valuation of potential deals.  As a result, firms often turn to investment bankers to serve as advisors during the M&A
process.  Consistent with uncertainty driving firms' decisions to retain M&A advisors, Servaes and Zenner (1996) find that
acquirers hire advisors when the deals are more complex and when the acquirer lacks prior acquisition experience. 
Investment banks can help match acquirers with targets, advise acquirers on target valuation, and/or counsel firms in
negotiating the deal price and structure (Goodman Name, 2014). 
While firms hire investment banks to reduce uncertainty in an attempt to make better investment decisions, we argue
that auditors can also serve to reduce uncertainty in the M&A process, even though they are not explicitly retained by firms
to do so.  In particular, auditors that audit both the acquirer and target (i. e. , common auditors) can reduce M&A uncertainty
through several channels.  The first, and arguably most important, channel is the direct communication of information
between the common auditor and the acquirers and targets, which can happen throughout the M&A process.  As indicated to
us in a private conversation with a Big 4 accounting partner, auditors often introduce their clients as potential acquisition
partners.  Thus, the auditor can facilitate discussions at the initial stage of the M&A process. 
Auditors can also provide considerable value during the due diligence phase, which includes assessing the target firm's
financial health, risks, prospects, etc.  After all, many of these assessments (or similar assessments) are made by the auditor
during an audit, so they can assist by providing both structure to the due diligence processes/analyses and insights into the
target based on their extensive knowledge of the firm.  In fact, further discussion with the Big 4 partner revealed that, with
the consent of clients, audit team members of the acquirer and the target often exchange information. 5 These discussions
can be very useful in appropriately valuing firms, and thus in negotiating the deal. 
The transfer of information between common-auditor clients continues even after the M&A as well.  For example,
common auditors can help integrate accounting information systems and internal control systems following deal
completion, which is a nontrivial task that is vital to the success of the M&A.  Since common auditors are familiar with
these systems for both the acquiring firm and the target firm, they can more efficiently amalgamate the systems to better
capture the firm's economics.
