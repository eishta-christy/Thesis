Strategies that provide information about the environmental impact
of activities are increasingly seen as an effective way to encourage conservation behavior (Evans Name, 2009).  The environmental impact of
everyday activities is often invisible to consumers who cannot gauge
the impact of their actions.  Information strategies that aim to correct
this information asymmetry are increasingly common (Foulon Name,
2002.  Kennedy Name, 1994).  These include mercury and air pollution
advisories (Cutter and Neidell, 2009.  Shimshack and Ward, 2010. 
Shimshack Name, 2007.  Zivin and Neidell, 2009).  mandatory and
voluntary corporate disclosure (Bennear and Olmstead, 2008.  Delmas
Name, 2010.  Evans Name, 2009.  Khanna, 2001.  Konar and Cohen, 1997. 
Lyon and Maxwell, 2007.  Powers Name, 2011) and ecolabels (Hallstein
and Villas-Boas, 2013.  Teisl Name, 2002).  Such strategies are based on
the principle that more and better information about the environmental
impact of activities will encourage consumers to conserve. 
Electricity conservation has been an especially active context
for the deployment of information strategies.  Electricity and heat generation accounts for over 40% of greenhouse gases across the world
(International Energy Agency, 2014) and effective conservation programs could contribute to signiﬁcant environmental improvements.  A
large number of energy conservation experiments have been conducted using various information strategies to reduce energy use
(Allcott, 2011.  Allcott and Rogers, 2014.  Asensio and Delmas, 2015. 
Delmas and Lessem, 2014.  Jessoe and Rapson, 2014).  These include
providing users with energy saving tips, historical individual usage,
real time energy usage, peer usage, etc.  Meta-analyses of these ﬁeld
experiments ﬁnd these strategies to be effective for conservation
(Delmas Name, 2013), although effectiveness varies with the type of
message provided. 
However, until very recently (McRae, 2015.  Pellerano Name 2015),
there have been no ﬁeld experiments in developing countries that focus
on information strategies for energy conservation behavior.  Indeed, a recent meta-analysis based on 156 ﬁeld trials published in peer-reviewed
journals from 1975 to 2012 found that 100% of the studies were conducted in developed countries, mostly Europe and the United States (Delmas
Name, 2013).  Developing countries differ in many characteristics from developed countries, including income and education levels, and information technology infrastructure, and it is unclear how energy information
strategies would perform in such contexts.  For example, conducting
ﬁeld experiments in developing countries could allow researchers to provide meaningful monetary gains and losses with the same amount that
would be considered trivial in developed countries (Harrison and List,
2004.
