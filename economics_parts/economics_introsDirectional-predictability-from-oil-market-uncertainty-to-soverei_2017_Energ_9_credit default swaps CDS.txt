 1.  Introduction Oil ranks among the most volatile non-agricultural commodities in the world and this volatility has increased in recent years due mainly to the recent global ﬁnancial crises, the surge in production of shale oil and the change in OPEC's policy from the quota mechanism to the market share maximization.  Oil prices dropped from $147/barrel in July 2008 to $32/barrel in March 2009 due particularly to the global ﬁnancial crisis of 2008–2009 and then climbed to more than $100/barrel in the ﬁrst quarter of 2011, rising in-line with the global economic recovery.  They dropped again in 2015 to under $50/barrel, where they have stayed, as a result of Saudi Arabia's decision seeking a greater market share as well as the increases in shale oil production.  In January 2016, the U. S.  oil prices plunged below $27/barrel for the ﬁrst time since 2003 due to a rise in global oil inventories, concurrently with traders also worried that the crude supply glut could linger.  Therefore, the oil volatility shocks are a major source of instability for the world economy, and they particularly impact the future economic health of oil-exporting countries that depend on oil exports for most of their revenues.  Under these circumstances, these countries have had to dip into their foreign reserves and thereby have seen their credit ratings drop signiﬁcantly, while the premiums on their credit default swaps (CDS) have soared because these credit derivatives generally measure the expected credit risk, fear, default, greed and future economic performance of countries (Hammoudeh et al. , 2013a, 2013b.
