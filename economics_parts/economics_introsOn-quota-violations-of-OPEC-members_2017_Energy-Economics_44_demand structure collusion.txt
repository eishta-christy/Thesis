OPEC has a fragile cartel structure.  It does not have a formal
enforcement mechanism in place (except for the occasional price war)
to incentivize its members to comply with their quota allocations
(Alhajji and Huettner, 2000).  As a result, non-compliance to the quota
has become a norm among OPEC members over the past decades. 
In every single quarter from 1993 to 2005, total OPEC production
exceeded the sum of its members’ quotas.  In this period, an OPEC
member over-produced its quota by an average of 6. 7%.  In this paper,
we provide a framework to explain such a persistent non-compliance
pattern based on strategic interactions among members inside OPEC. 
Quota violations vary signiﬁcantly among different countries.  For
example, Saudi Arabia’s overproduction averaged around 3. 2% from
1995 to 2007 but Qatar’s overproduction averaged around 18. 5% during the same period.  In extreme cases, some members overproduce
their quotas by a large margin.  For example, in the second quarter of 1998, OPEC requested that Qatar cut its production to reach a
quota of 384 thousand bpd due to falling oil prices, but Qatar kept its
production level at 670 thousand bpd–a 75% quota non-compliance. 
Another extreme example is Algeria who overproduced its quota by
more than 50% in 13 out of 24 quarters between 2002 and 2006. 
Moreover, as suggested by a large body of theoretical literature1, the
diﬃculty of supporting collusion varies with the economic state of
the market.  Based on these preliminary observations, we ask the following.  is non-compliance related to oil market conditions.  If so, is
it a pro-cyclical or a counter-cyclical behavior.  How does the degree
of non-compliance differ for smaller vs.  larger producers.  To what
extent does OPEC rely on the quota system. 
There are a number of prominent empirical studies on OPEC
behavior, but the majority of them focus on whether OPEC behaves
as a cartel or not, rather than analyzing the nature of quotas and
violations.  To name a few, Griﬃn (1985), tests the market-sharing
hypothesis by looking at the co-movement of each country’s production with that of the rest of OPEC.  He concludes that “OPEC is a looser
cartel” given that market sharing considerations only partially affect
production decisions.  Gülen (1996) uses a similar intuition to test
for parallel movements in members’ output levels.  He ﬁnds evidence
of coordination among members, especially during the rationing
period, 1982–1993.  Dahl and Yücel (1991) ﬁnd no evidence in support of several hypotheses for OPEC behavior including dynamic
optimization, target revenue, cartel, competitive, and swing producers.  Therefore, they conclude that “loose coordination or duopoly” is
the closest description to OPEC behavior.  However, as pointed out
by Smith (2005), there are serious concerns regarding the low power
of the statistical tests employed in these studies and the extent to
which they are capable of distinguishing between collusive and competitive behavior within OPEC.  He describes OPEC as “much more
than a non-cooperative oligopoly, but less than a friction-less cartel. ”
Instead of calling this strand of literature inconclusive, we prefer
the conclusion that some of the studies reach—such as Geroski Name
(1987), Almoguera Name (2011) and Kaufmann Name (2008)—that
OPEC behavior cannot be ﬁtted into a single model, but rather it
follows a varying-conduct model that switches between collusive
and non-cooperative behavior over time.  We use the same notion
in our theory model by formulating the proposed framework as a
combination of a cooperative game and a non-cooperative behavior. 
Although the empirical evidence for OPEC’s collusion behavior
is mixed, the ﬁeld of industrial organization provides a sharp predictions for one of the factors affecting collusion.  the link between
market conditions and the incentive to cheat in a cartel.  The standard
approach in this literature is to repeat game models in which cartel members interact via their choice of production levels or prices. 
In this approach, members choose to cooperate or cheat in each
period by comparing the net value of cooperation vs.  that of deviation.  If they cooperate, they receive a moderate period payoff for
cooperation with a continuation of this payoff in the future.  However, if they decide to cheat, they will enjoy a high period payoff
but will face punishment in the future.  The prediction of this literature is that it’s harder to collude in booms because the incentive to
cheat is higher2.  For example, Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) show
that with an i. i. d.  demand structure collusion is harder to support in
booms, simply because the net gains of deviation are higher.  Assuming a cyclical demand, Haltiwanger and Harrington Jr (1991) show
that the incentive to cheat is stronger at the end of a boom when
the demand is about to fall.
