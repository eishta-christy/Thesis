 1.  Introduction The Transmission Network Expansion Planning Problem (TNEPP) is a classical problem in power electrical engineering and basically the problem consists in ﬁnding new transmission lines for an adequate operation over a planning horizon.  Traditionally, the problem was solved as a separate problem from the generation planning problem1, even though in the early days most electrical systems operated with a vertical structure and there was a central planner that somehow gave the conditions to coordinate the investment decisions in transmission and generation.  At the end of the 1970s competition was introduced in several electric utilities2.  In this competitive setting, no central planner is in charge of investments.  Instead, ﬁrst, generation companies decide their new capacity in function of their expected beneﬁts in the market.  Then, the transmission company decides the transmission capacity needed to transmit the energy from the new generators.  In mathematical terms, this interaction can be modeled by multilevel optimization problems.  In the specialized literature several multilevel models have been proposed.  an important remark is that the models implicitly assume that the opportunity cost of transmission capacity is determined by the price difference at the line endpoints 4.  This paper recognizes that the opportunity cost of transmission capacity not only depends on the difference of marginal costs at line endpoints, but also on the location of new generators.  Due to this, economic externalities arise when investment decisions are decentralized, so that the decentralized result does not lead to a Pareto optimal solution.  A good example of externalities in real power systems is the Peruvian case.  Before 2014, the Peruvian network consisted of two large areas (North and South) connected through a long transmission line (220 kV, 612 km).  The Southern area imports electricity from the North.  Moreover, the South has a large source of gas known as Camisea Gas and a gas pipeline was built in 2004 in order to deliver gas to the North.  After the entrance of the pipeline, many generation companies decided to invest in new capacity only in the North.  however, electricity demand in the South grew and no generation capacity was built there.  Due to this, a new transmission line (500 kV, 1000 km) between the North and South was placed in service in the year 2014.  Moreover, another line (500 kV, 1000 km) between the North and South is been constructed and will be placed in service by the year 2017.  Badly placed generators introduced negative externalities in the transmission planning.  Obviously, if generation companies had invested in the South, no transmission lines would have been needed.  In this context, we discuss how separating generation expansion from transmission planning can cause negative externalities to the transmission planning problem.  The organization of the paper is as follows.  in Section 2, we discuss how externalities can affect the TNEPP using a basic model.  in Section 3, we formulate a centralized multistage model for ﬁnding simultaneous optimal generation and transmission capacity.  The model is based on previous work of van der Weijde and Hobbs (2012) and O’Neill et al.  (2013).  The main purpose of the model is to show examples of externalities.  In Section 4, we present case studies for the 24-bus test system and the Peruvian system.  Finally, in Section 5 we present the conclusions of the article.  2.  A discussion about transmission capacity opportunity cost and externalities.  Some articles5 implicitly assume that the opportunity cost of transmission capacity is determined only by the price difference at the line endpoints.  That said, the work of the transmission company is reduced to ﬁnding the set of transmission lines that minimize the cost of investment added to the cost of operation, taking the future generation projects as an input.  The above does not take into account that relocating the future generators could have avoided the construction of additional lines.  This interdependence of transmission and generation capacity means that decisions in new transmission and generation capacity must be coordinated to achieve maximum total surplus.  To show our reasoning we use a two-bus system in which all the parameters are certain6.  Consider the example shown in Fig.  1, the generator at node A has a marginal cost cA = $4/MWh and the generator at node B has a marginal cost cB = $7/MWh.  Node B needs 1000 MW to meet its demand for a period of t = 105 h, this demand can be supplied either from a new line or a new generator.  Consider that 1000 MW of transmission capacity can be built with an investment cost of a = $1 × 106.  Also, 1000 MW of generation capacity can be built at node B with an investment cost of b = $200 × 106 and a marginal cost of cC = $3/MWh.  Let us ﬁnd the Pareto optimal solution.  The demand is modeled as depicted in Fig.  2.  in which electricity demand d is constant (inelastic) until the price reaches a certain value called the Value of Lost Load (VOLL).  Above the VOLL the consumers are not willing to pay and a load curtailment r must be considered.  This is an acceptable approximation for real-world electricity demand7.  The total surplus in the model is given by the area below the demand considering a t number of hours of operation minus the operation cost OC of running the generators and the investment cost IC of building new capacity in the electrical system.  Surplus = voll •(d − r)t − (OC + IC)The power ﬂow of the line is given by fAB (from A to B), power produced by generators A, B and C are given by gA, gB and gC respectively.  Then, at each node the sum of power ﬂows must be zero.  Node B.  d − r = gB + gC + fABWe represent the investment decision in the transmission line with a binary variable y, with investment cost a.  While the decision variable for investing in a generator is represented with the binary variable w, with investment cost b.  Note that gB and fab can be zero depending on the binary variables.  For the candidate generators we relate their production with their capacity limits multiplied by the binary variable w, if the generator is not built its production is zero.  The same reasoning is made for the transmission line, if the line is not built then power ﬂow is zero.  Let us simplify the objective function of the model.  Since d is a parameter for the problem it can be neglected from the objective function without changing the result.  Also, the maximization problem can be expressed as a minimization of the negative of the objective function.  Then, the objective function can be rewritten as follows.  The operation cost is given by the production of each generator multiplied by its respective marginal cost.  The investment cost is given by the investment cost in the transmission line plus the investment cost in the generator multiplied by their respective binary variables.  Finally, gathering the objective function with the restrictions we have the following optimization problem.  The time horizon is divided into a set of stages or years, YT.  each stage has an annual duration curve.  The investments in new transmission and generation capacity are made at the beginning of each stage and then the network operates with this new stock of equipment until the next stage (Fig.  3).  The variables of the problem are gA, gB, gC, fAB, w and y.  For this small electrical system, we simply compute with a spreadsheet the overall cost for each option considering dispatch of the generators in order of marginal cost.  The results are shown in Table 1.  Now, for the same problem consider that the investment cost in the new generator is reduced to $100 × 106, the new results are shown in Table 2.  It can be seen that the solution (investments) change from one case to another even if the marginal costs do not change.  Also, we see that it is always useful to compare the cost of a new line with the cost of a new local generator.  For large systems, this is equivalent to minimizing the investment costs in transmission and generation in the same problem.  In a decentralized market, generation companies make their investment decisions in generation capacity without taking into account the transmission investment cost nor the possible load curtailment.  After this, the transmission company makes its investments.  As a result of the process, the generation investment level introduces negative externalities to the transmission planning problem.  <Middle> A model for simultaneous optimal planning of transmission and generation capacity.  We formulate a centralized multistage stochastic model that ﬁnds the Pareto optimal solution for a considered planning horizon using a DC formulation of network ﬂows, the model is based in the work of van der Weijde and Hobbs (2012) and O’Neill et al.  (2013)8.  In Table 3 we present the notation used.  For each year, the annual duration curve (Fig.  4) is decomposed in a set of discrete blocks of demand YU, in where the width of each block is the associated number of hours tu and the height of the block represents the inelastic part of the curve demand depicted in Fig.  2.  We consider future demand as uncertain9, for each block of demand a number of scenarios could be possible,which is represented by the set of scenarios YS,where each scenario has a probability ps.  At this point we identify the recourse variables of the stochastic problem, which are the variables that change with the scenario.  All variables that are related to the operation of the network (production, power ﬂows of the lines, load curtailment, etc) are the recourse variables.  We will denote those variables with the s superscript.
