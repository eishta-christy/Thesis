 1.  Introduction.  All auditors (US and foreign) who audit US-listed companies are required to register with the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board (PCAOB) and be subject to PCAOB inspections.  In this study, we focus on foreign auditors and consider  whether audit quality for non -US-listed foreign public clients (non-US-listed clients) is higher following the initial PCAOB inspection.  Our study addresses the issue of positive externality, i. e. , whether the PCAOB international inspection program  improves audit quality for foreign auditors’ non-US-listed foreign clients even though investors in these particular foreign  companies are not the intended beneﬁciaries of the foreign auditor inspection program The impact of the PCAOB international inspection program on audit quality abroad is ambiguous.  Given the PCAOB’s  reputation for actively looking for auditor misconduct and taking follow-up disciplinary actions against deﬁcient auditors  ( DeFond, 2010.  Farrell and Shabad, 2005 ), the very act of registering with the PCAOB may exacerbate foreign auditors’ exposure to reputation loss and provide them with an ex ante incentive to strengthen their ﬁrm -level quality controls and  increase audit quality.  To the extent that audit deﬁciencies are discovered during the initial inspection, the auditor may  have an additional incentive to take appropriate remedial action and strengthen ﬁrm-level quality controls to avoid further  embarrassment on subsequent inspections.  The improvements in the foreign auditor’s ﬁrm -level quality controls could increase audit quality for all of the ﬁrm’s foreign clients US-listed or otherwise.  Moreover, because the starting point for audit  quality is potentially lower abroad than in the US ( Choi et al. , 2008.  Francis and Wang, 2008 ), the PCAOB inspection program  could have a greater impact abroad than in the US.   However, reasons exist to doubt the eﬃcacy of PCAOB inspections in improving audit quality.  Prior research ( DeFond,  2010.  Lennox and Pittman, 2010 ) indicates that PCAOB inspection reports are not useful for assessing audit quality because  they merely list audit deﬁciencies and do not provide a summary opinion about the auditor’s quality.  Moreover, the effectiveness of the PCAOB’s international inspections may be limited by geographic distance from the US, potential language  differences, or cultural barriers.  Finally, foreign auditors may follow an asymmetric approach to their US-listed and nonUS-listed clients.  Given that the PCAOB is primarily interested in protecting investors in US-listed companies (selecting only  US-listed client engagements for inspection) and the fact that auditor litigation exposure is lower for non-US-listed clients  than for US-listed clients, foreign auditors may be less incentivized to improve audit quality for their non-US-listed clients.   Foreign auditors may override their ﬁrm-level quality controls and utilize less effective audit programs or assemble less  qualiﬁed audit teams for their non-US-listed clients (which may be less costly).  To the extent that foreign auditors follow  an asymmetric approach in servicing their US-listed and non-US-listed clients, any PCAOB inspection-related improvements  in ﬁrm-level quality controls may not necessarily beneﬁt their non-US-listed audit clients.  For all these reasons, the overall  effectiveness of the PCAOB international inspection program in improving audit quality for foreign auditors’ non-US-listed  clients is far from obvious and remains an open empirical question.   Because the quality of ﬁnancial reporting is a joint outcome of manager and auditor decision making, audit quality is  best viewed as a continuum with higher audit quality providing greater assurance of ﬁnancial reporting quality ( DeFond and  Zhang, 2014 ).  Still, beyond the notion that better audit quality leads to better ﬁnancial reporting quality, little or no consensus emerges in the extant literature as to how best to measure audit quality.  Hence, given that all audit quality proxies have  their limitations, we use multiple ﬁnancial reporting quality measures (such as discretionary accruals, the propensity to just  meet or beat earnings expectations, and accruals quality) that capture different dimensions of the audit quality construct.   In addition, we employ a measure of auditor independence.  the likelihood of the auditor issuing a modiﬁed opinion for  non-US-listed clients as a proxy for audit quality.  For non-US-listed clients, this metric is similar to the propensity to issue  a going-concern opinion for US-listed clients, and it is generally viewed as a measure of the auditor’s ability to withstand  client pressure to issue a clean audit opinion ( DeFond et al. , 2002.  Chen et al. , 2010.  Fung et al. , 2016 ).   Our study covers a 13-year period (2002–2014) and includes a total of 61,612 non-US-listed client-year observations with  PCAOB-registered foreign auditors from 55 non-US countries.  Our sample includes observations from countries that allow  as well as those that prohibit PCAOB inspections.  In our difference-in-differences (DID) research design, we control for the  threat of PCAOB inspections based not only on whether the observation is from a country that allows (or prohibits) PCAOB  inspections (consistent with Lamoreaux (2016) ) but also on a model that captures the likelihood of the client-year observa3 Our ﬁndings suggest that initial inspections have an incremental  tion being audited by a PCAOB-inspected foreign auditor.   effect on the audit quality of the foreign auditor over and above the effect of the threat of such inspections.  These ﬁndings  are of particular interest because some countries (such as China) continue to disallow PCAOB inspections.  Our ﬁndings are  consistent with those of Aobdia and Shroff (2017) who suggest that PCAOB oversight of non-U. S.  auditors with US-listed  clients increases the perceived assurance value of their audits and is reﬂected in an increase in their market share in their  home countries.   All of our results continue to hold when we re-estimate our tests using a matched sample based on the propensity score  of a non-US-listed foreign client having a PCAOB-inspected foreign auditor.  Further, we examine whether the strength of  the positive relation between PCAOB inspections and audit quality metrics for foreign auditors’ non-US-listed clients (the  externality effect) varies cross-sectionally over a number of factors.  The ﬁndings from our cross-sectional analyses suggest  that, controlling for the threat of inspections, the impact of the initial inspection is stronger when the likelihood of a foreign  auditor being inspected by the PCAOB is lower, in countries without a substantive increase in ﬁnancial reporting enforcement, in countries with lower liability standards for accountants, for earlier (versus later) initial inspections, and for foreign  auditors aﬃliated with one of the six global audit ﬁrm networks (GNs).  Consistent with the notion that PCAOB inspectors  share their ﬁndings and suggestions for improvement with the auditor at the time of the inspection itself without having  the auditor wait for the formal inspection report ( Aobdia, 2016 ), in additional analyses we ﬁnd that the improvement in  audit quality for foreign auditors’ non-US-listed clients is observable in the year the initial inspection report is issued and  that the improvement has persistence beyond the ﬁrst year.   Our paper contributes to the literature in several ways.  First, our study, to our knowledge, is the ﬁrst to examine whether  the PCAOB’s international inspection program (which is intended to improve audit quality for foreign auditors’ US-listed  clients) has a positive externality effect, i. e. , also improves audit quality for foreign auditors’ non-US-listed clients.   Our study complements studies by Lamoreaux (2016) and Krishnan et al.  (2017) who examine the direct audit quality effect of  PCAOB inspections, i. e. , focus on foreign auditors’ US-listed clients.  We contribute by documenting a positive externality in  that non-US listed audit clients beneﬁt from their audit ﬁrms’ PCAOB inspections.   Second, we contribute to the literature on auditor incentives and reputation concerns outside the US.  With respect to  incentives, prior research (e. g. , Lennox, 1999 .  Khurana and Raman, 2004 ) suggests that litigation exposure, not reputation  protection, is a driver of audit quality outside the US.  Along the same lines, Francis and Wang (2008) propose that audit  quality abroad is a function of investor protection.  The stronger the country-level legal institutions, the higher the auditor  incentive to provide a quality audit.  However, Weber et al.  (2008) and Skinner and Srinivasan (2012) argue that reputation  loss imposes actual costs on an auditor (in the form of lost market share) in Germany and Japan, respectively, and thereby  incentivizes audit quality even in countries with little or no legal exposure.  Pertinent to reputation concerns, the PCAOB’s  international inspections have the potential for embarrassing the foreign auditor through adverse publicity by disclosing  engagement-level audit deﬁciencies and for not remediating ﬁrm-level quality control deﬁciencies on a timely basis.  Our  ﬁndings are consistent with the notion that auditor reputation matters outside the US in that the initial PCAOB inspection has an incremental salutary effect on the foreign auditor’s audit quality over and above the effect of the threat of an  inspection itself.   Finally,  our  study  contributes  to  the  inquiry  of  the  eﬃcacy  of  the  PCAOB  international  inspection  program  in  improving  audit  quality.   As  noted  by  Carcello  et  al.   (2010) ,  US-listed  companies  audited  by  foreign  auditors  account  for  more  than  $650  billion  in  US  market  capitalization.   Further,  foreign  auditors  play  a  substantial  role  in  the  audit  of  US  domestic  companies  by  auditing  foreign  subsidiaries  that  are  material  to  the  consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements  of  US  multinationals.   For  these  reasons,  the  PCAOB  views  inspections  of  foreign  auditors  as  a  priority  and  devotes  substantial  resources  to  its  international  inspections  program.   Still,  the  board  faces  a  diﬃcult  challenge  in  this  area  because  a  number  of  countries  (such  as  China)  have  barred  PCAOB  inspections  within  their  borders  (on  national  sovereignty  grounds),  thereby  increasing  the  risk  of  substandard  audit  quality  for  investors  in  US-listed  companies.   We  document  that  the  PCAOB  international  inspection  program  generates  a  positive  externality,  as  it  not  only  improves  audit  quality  for  foreign  auditors’  US-listed  clients  (as  shown  in  concurrent  studies  by  Lamoreaux  (2016 )  and  Krishnan  et  al.   (2017 )),  but  also  for  their  non-US-listed  clients,  thereby  improving  investor  protection  from  substandard  audits  for  US  investors and foreign investors in non-US-listed foreign public companies.  These ﬁndings potentially allow foreign countries  and  regulators  to  better  assess  the  desirability  (in  terms  of  the  favorable  audit  quality  impact  for  their  own  domestic  investors  in  non-US-listed  public  companies)  of  allowing  the  PCAOB  to  conduct  inspections  in  their  home  countries.   The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 provides background information and develops our hypotheses.  Section 3 presents the research methodology and data description.  A discussion of empirical results follows in  Section 4 .  Section 5 provides concluding remarks.   2.  Background and hypothesis development.  2. 1.  Background.  The PCAOB was established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX.  PL 107-204) with the objective of improving audit  quality for companies listed in US public securities markets.  To achieve this objective, the board is vested with broad powers  to oversee and discipline auditors (US and foreign) of US-listed companies and to conduct mandatory inspections of these  auditors as a new channel for improving audit quality.  Inspections for US auditors began in 2004.  Inspections for foreign  auditors commenced the following year, on a staggered basis, as the PCAOB sought to build its international inspection staff and obtain the necessary permission from foreign governments to conduct inspections of foreign auditors in their home  countries.  Also, while large auditors (those with more than 100 US-listed public company clients) are subject to annual  inspections, small auditors are inspected triennially.  Overwhelmingly, foreign auditors, including those aﬃliated with the six  global audit ﬁrm networks, are small auditors.   Prior research on the eﬃcacy of PCAOB domestic inspections in improving audit quality for US auditors indicates that  the  threat  of  inspections  drove  nearly  half  of  the  small  US  audit  ﬁrms  out  of  the  market  for  public  company  audits  and  thereby  increased  average  audit  quality  for  small  auditors  ( DeFond  and  Lennox  2011 ).   Other  studies  ( Abbott  et  al. ,  2013.  Gunny and Zhang, 2013.  Gramling et al. , 2011 ) show that audit quality (as measured by clients’ lower discretionary  accruals  and  auditors’  increased  propensity  to  issue  going-concern  opinions)  improved  for  small  US  auditors  following  inspections.   With respect to large US auditors, some limited evidence exists that PCAOB inspections improve audit quality.  Carcello  et al.  (2011b) report that, for a sample of US-listed clients audited by Big 4 ﬁrms, the initial PCAOB inspections were associated with an improvement in audit quality as measured by a decline in abnormal accruals.  By contrast, Boone et al.   (2015) indicate that each of the Big 4 auditors in the US have received inspection reports identifying audit deﬁciencies  every year since the beginning of inspections in 2004, but that these large ﬁrms have been largely blasé about adverse  inspection reports because the PCAOB ﬁndings are based on “second-guessing” by “government bureaucrats” ( Norris, 2011a,  6 Further, although the PCAOB’s censure of Deloitte in December 2007 (the ﬁrst-ever PCAOB censure of a Big 4  2011b, 2011c ).   ﬁrm for not remediating ﬁrm-level quality control deﬁciencies on a timely basis) inﬂicted losses on the auditor in the form  of increased risk of client loss and lower audit fees, Boone et al.  (2015) report that Deloitte’s audit quality was not different  from that of other Big 4 ﬁrms during a three-year window either before or after the PCAOB censure.  More recently, Gipper  et al.  (2016) examine increases in short-window earnings response coeﬃcients (ERCs) around earnings announcements for  US-listed domestic clients following PCAOB inspections of their US auditors and report signiﬁcant ﬁndings for both Big 4  and non–Big 4 auditors.  Finally, regarding the eﬃcacy of PCAOB domestic inspections, we are not aware of any studies on  US auditors with non-US-listed foreign public clients or of any studies pertaining to PCAOB inspections of US auditors with  non-US-listed clients.   With respect to the eﬃcacy of PCAOB international inspections in improving audit quality for foreign auditors’ US-listed  clients (the direct effect of the inspections), two studies address this issue.  Lamoreaux (2016) suggests that the threat of  PCAOB inspections (as proxied by whether or not the foreign auditor is located in a country that allows PCAOB inspections)  is associated with improved audit outcomes, such as an increased propensity on the part of the foreign auditor to issue  going-concern opinions for US-listed clients.  By contrast, Krishnan et al.  (2017) investigate the effect of the initial inspection  of foreign auditors and report a decrease in abnormal accruals as well as an increase in the value relevance of accounting  numbers for their US-listed clients.  In examining the audit quality impact of the initial inspection, they do not control for the  threat of a PCAOB inspection preceding the inspection.  Separately (and possibly as a means of putting pressure on countries,  such as China, that disallow PCAOB inspections), the Board in 2010 disclosed the names of US-listed companies with foreign  auditors located in countries that do not allow PCAOB inspections.  Carcello et al.  (2011a) ﬁnd that the stock market reacted  adversely to these disclosures, that is, investors reacted negatively to the news that the PCAOB is not allowed to inspect the  foreign auditors of US-listed clients in their home countries.  Our study controls for the threat of a PCAOB inspection and  examines the incremental audit quality impact of the initial PCAOB inspection for foreign auditors’ non-US-listed clients, i. e. ,  we examine the externality effect associated with the PCAOB international inspection program.   2. 2.  Hypothesis development.  The PCAOB  utilizes a risk-based (instead of a random or representative) sample approach to identify US-listed audit  engagements to review and is known to be actively looking for auditor misconduct.  Also, during inspections, the PCAOB  evaluates the  design and  effectiveness of  the  auditor’s  ﬁrm- level quality  control  systems  ( Center  for  Audit  Quality  CAQ,  2012 .  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, 2012 ).  The underlying motivation for assessing the effectiveness of the  auditor’s ﬁrm-level quality controls is to increase audit quality for all of the auditor’s US-listed audit clients, not just the  sample of  US-listed  clients  (engagements) selected  for  review.   In  the  case  of  the  PCAOB’s  international inspections,  the  improvements in the foreign auditor’s ﬁrm - level quality controls could beneﬁt not only its US-listed clients but also its non US-listed clients.  Further, the PCAOB can issue inspection reports that publicly disclose engagement-level deﬁciencies, albeit  without identifying the client involved, and censure the auditor (i. e. , impose ﬁnes or bar the auditor from continuing to audit  US-listed clients) for ﬁrm-level quality control weaknesses that are not remediated on a timely basis (typically within 12  months) to the satisfaction of the board ( Center for Audit Quality CAQ, 2012 .  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,  2012 ).   The public disclosure of audit deﬁciencies and possible censure by the PCAOB could embarrass the audit ﬁrm and damage  its reputation.  Prior research ( Boone et al. , 2015.  Klein and Leﬄer, 1981.  Schmalensee, 1978.  Shapiro, 1982.  Smallwood and  Conlisk, 1979.  Von Weizsacker, 1980 ) suggests that such reputational harm can inﬂict economic losses on the auditor by  triggering  a  decline  in  the  demand  for  the  ﬁrm’s  services  or  by  lowering  its  selling  price  and  that  the  threat  of  these  economic losses incentivizes the ﬁrm to maintain its service quality.  Consistent with this argument, recent studies ( Weber  et al. , 2008.  Skinner and Srinivasan, 2012 ) ﬁnd that auditor reputation matters outside the US, too.  Reputational harm can  result in loss of audit clients and market share.  Further, other research ( Choi et al. , 2008.  Francis and Wang, 2008 ) shows  that audit quality is lower outside the US due to extant lower levels of auditor litigation exposure and investor protection  abroad.  Because PCAOB standards require the auditor to have strong ﬁrm-level quality control systems and the inspections  essentially represent a new channel for identifying auditor misconduct, it is reasonable (consistent with DeFond (2010) ) to  expect the threat of PCAOB inspections to provide PCAOB-registered foreign auditors (at least in countries that allow PCAOB  inspections) with an ex ante incentive to improve audit quality.  To the extent that the initial inspection identiﬁes deﬁciencies  in the auditor’s ﬁrm-level quality control systems, the inspection may be expected to be associated with higher audit quality.   For these reasons, our expectation is for both the threat and the initial PCAOB inspection to be associated with an increase  in audit quality.   However, several considerations could mitigate or negate the effect of PCAOB inspections (threatened or actual) on audit quality for foreign auditors.  First, as noted by Palmrose (2006) , PCAOB inspections appear to trade off independence  for expertise.  Although PCAOB inspectors are independent of the profession, they may lack cutting-edge audit knowledge  because they cannot be practicing certiﬁed public accountants.  Others (e. g. , Glover et al. , 2009 .  Lennox and Pittman, 2010 )  have expressed concerns about the quality and expertise of the inspection staff, the effectiveness of the feedback system,  the timeliness of the inspection reports, and the usefulness of the information in the inspection reports.  Second, the audit  deﬁciencies revealed in PCAOB inspection reports may reﬂect no more than differences in professional judgment between  the inspector and the auditor about what constitutes appropriate evidence and documentation, i. e.
