 Introduction The auditor's report is the primary channel through which auditors communicate with financial statement users information discovered during the auditing process.  Financial analysts and regulators have criticized the existing auditor's reporting model as having little communicative value, and additional disclosures have been proposed to enhance the value of the audit report (Church et al. , 2008.  PCAOB, 2013). 1 Under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement and Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), the auditor's reporting options are to issue either an unqualified opinion or an unqualified opinion with explanatory language, commonly called a modified audit opinion (MAO). 2 This inclusion of discretionary explanatory language, such as citing a lack of accounting consistency, emphasizing a material uncertainty, or expressing a going concern (GC) opinion, is the only difference between a standard clean opinion and an MAO. 3 In fact, an MAO is the sole way for auditors to communicate audit-specific information to outsiders. 4 There is still debate, however, about the extent to which the auditor's report communicates relevant information to financial statement users (Church et al. , 2008.  DeFond and Zhang, 2014).  In this study, we empirically investigate the relevance of MAOs in private debt contracting.  A large portion of the prior research that studied modified opinions focuses on the market reaction to the auditor's report and provides evidence that equity investors react negatively to the issuance of a nonstandard opinion, especially to a GC opinion (e. g.  Loudder et al. , 1992.  Fleak and Wilson, 1994.  Menon and Williams, 2010).  We investigate the relevance of auditor reporting from the perspective of debtholders for several reasons.  First, accounting information is often a direct input in debt contracting.  for example, debt covenants may rely on accounting numbers to monitor firm performance.  If an MAO indicates low financial reporting quality, lenders will change the relative use of accounting-based covenants and general covenants in loans issued after MAOs.  Second, debt contracts provide multi-dimensional information about borrowers.  loan contracts allow us to investigate the effects of audit opinions on both price and non-price costs of debt, including loan covenants, loan size, loan maturity, and collateral requirements.  Finally, debtholders, whose payoffs are concave in relation to firm value, demand a timely shift of control rights in order to discipline managers in the case of poor firm performance (Dewatripont and Tirole, 1994.  Ball et al. , 2008).  This implies that debtholders should react to information in MAOs for both pricing and monitoring purposes, because MAOs are likely to communicate negative news about clients’ financial reporting quality and credit worthiness.  Thus, examining lenders’ responses to MAOs can enhance our understanding of the usefulness of auditor reporting.  Lenders are likely to find the audit report relevant and useful in two ways.  First, through the audit opinion and associated explanatory language, the auditor communicates information about the quality of financial reports for debt contracting purposes.  The relevance of MAOs in debt contracting depends on the severity of the auditor's concern as expressed in the explanatory language.  Second, MAOs communicate private information about clients’ credit risk to lenders that is not available elsewhere.  Therefore, we expect the relevance of MAOs to lenders varies with the risks conveyed in the MAO.  To analyze the relevance of MAOs in debt contracting, we first categorize audit opinions into clean and modified opinions.  If an MAO indicates low financial reporting quality and potential credit risk, we predict that loans issued to firms after an MAO will be associated with a higher cost of debt, reflected across different contract terms.  To examine the incremental relevance of explanatory language, we classify MAOs into two general types, which we further partition into four groups by their cause.  Inconsistency opinions are caused by an Accounting Change or a Restatement.  and Inadequacy opinions are caused by Material Uncertainty or a GC Opinion. 5 MAOs issued because of an accounting Inconsistency alert financial statement users about the incomparability of data contained in the financial statements.  MAOs issued for Inadequacy reasons express auditors’ more serious concerns about the quality of the financial statements because of unrecognized losses or risk.  Material uncertainty concerns are related to the resolution of future economically relevant unknowns (e. g. , contingent liabilities, litigation risk, and business uncertainty), and GC opinions indicate that a key assumption of the accounting model is violated (i. e. , that the firm will continue as a going concern for at least one year).  The severity of the auditor's concern is greater in Inadequacy opinions than in Inconsistency opinions.  Among the four types of MAOs, GC opinions require the most auditor judgment and, therefore, are likely to convey more of auditors’ private information than other types of MAOs. 6 We find that loans initiated after MAOs have higher loan spreads (on average, 17 basis points higher) compared to loans initiated after clean opinions, controlling for other determinants of the interest rate.  In addition, the effects of MAOs on loan spreads vary significantly depending on the type of explanatory language.  The loan spread effect increases from 0 basis points after an Accounting Change to 25, 49, and 107 basis points, on average, after Restatement, Material Uncertainty, and GC Opinions, respectively.  These results support our prediction that interest rates increase after an MAO and that the effect varies with the type of MAO.  We also find that lenders decrease the use of financial covenants and increase the use of general covenants in loans initiated after an MAO.  Specifically, lenders decrease the use of financial covenants by 3. 8% and increase the use of general covenants (such as restrictions on dividend payouts or on the uses of borrowed funds) by 4. 2%, on average, after an MAO.  Again, the relevance of an MAO depends on the type of modification.  We find that Inconsistency MAOs have a smaller, but still significant, effect on the use of financial and general covenants than do Inadequacy MAOs.  Within Inadequacy MAOs, Material Uncertainty opinions are associated with an average increase of 18. 2% in the use of general covenants but have no effect on the use of financial covenants.  In contrast, GC opinions are associated with an average decrease of 9. 1% in the number of included financial covenants and an average increase of 12. 3% in the number of included general covenants.  The results from the debt covenant tests suggest that MAOs convey relevant information to lenders and that the use of the financial reports in debt contracting varies with the type of concern expressed by the auditor in the MAO.  We provide further evidence on the relevance of MAOs on other loan terms including loan size, the likelihood of requiring collateral, and loan maturity.  Consistent with our predictions, we find that lenders reduce loan sizes and increase the likelihood of requiring collateral following an MAO.  The results on loan maturity show a significant decrease in loan maturities after a GC opinion, which is consistent with GC opinions communicating the auditor's information about the client's credit risk to lenders.  The overall decrease in loan term favorability and the variation of the effects of MAOs suggest that MAOs communicate information useful to lenders in negotiating debt contracts.  Following our main empirical analysis, we perform two separate analyses on our sample of observations with GC opinions.  First, following Menon and Williams (2010), we classify GC opinions as being related to firm performance, financing concerns, or other issues and investigate the effects of each type of GC opinion on the loan contract terms previously tested.  We find that each type of GC opinion has a unique effect on loan spread and other loan terms.  this finding reinforces the usefulness of information provided in the auditor's report.  Second, we test whether GC opinions communicate private information about a client's credit risk that is not available elsewhere.  We do so by matching firms with GC opinions to similar firms based on the determinants of receiving a GC opinion using variables from prior studies (DeFond et al. , 2002), but that received clean opinions in their audit reports.  If GC opinions simply capture the probability of financial distress or bankruptcy, as predicted by publically observable information, they should have no incremental effect on loan contract terms in the matched-sample specifications.  We find, however, that GC opinions continue to have a significant effect on all of the loans terms examined except financial covenants.  Overall, these results are consistent with a GC opinion communicating the auditor’ private information regarding the client's credit risk to lenders.  It stands to reason that managers of firms preparing to secure financing are likely to be in contact with potential lenders preceding a loan issuance, but we are unable to directly control for information that managers privately provide to lenders.  To alleviate the concern that our empirical results regarding the association between MAOs and loan terms may pick up unobservable public and private communication channels, we include a new indicator variable, Before_MAO, that takes a value of 1 if a loan is issued in the 12 months preceding an MAO, and zero otherwise.  If the private information conveyed by the auditor is actually preempted elsewhere (by managers communicating to lenders or other public information) before an MAO, then we would expect a significant coefficient on this new variable.  In tests of each of the contract terms we investigate, however, Before_MAO is insignificant, which provides further support that our results capture the effects of audit opinions.  Our study makes several contributions to the existing literature.  First, our study investigates the usefulness of the audit report to lenders in debt contracting by incorporating the auditor's explanatory language.  The empirical results provide evidence that MAOs are informative to lenders in negotiating loan agreements, but more importantly, that the different types of MAOs communicate different concerns to lenders about financial reporting quality and credit risk.  While prior studies show that the voluntary use of auditing or the employment of Big N auditors is associated with a lower cost of debt (Fortin and Pittman, 2007.  Lennox and Pittman, 2011.  Minnis, 2011), we provide evidence on the incremental value of audit reporting to lenders.  For regulators, our empirical results may be useful in informing the current debate on regulatory initiatives to include disclosures of “critical audit matters” in the audit report (PCAOB, 2013.  DeFond and Zhang, 2014).  Second, our study is related to the literature on the role of financial reporting quality in debt contracting.  Bharath et al.  (2008) provided evidence that the quality of a borrower's accounting information can affect their access to the private versus public debt market and the included loan terms.  Costello and Wittenberg-Moerman (2011) documented that lenders alter debt contracts when a borrower reports an internal control weakness.  These studies, however, do not address the specific role of the audit report within financial reporting.  Our study provides empirical evidence that audit opinions are incrementally informative to lenders in the private debt market.  Lastly, our empirical results on the usefulness of GC opinions in debt contracting contribute to the vast auditing literature on GC opinions.  Prior studies report evidence that GC opinions are useful in predicting subsequent bankruptcies and are associated with negative stock market reactions (Hopwood et al. , 1989.  Raghunandan and Rama, 1995.  Chen and Church, 1996.  Menon and Williams, 2010.  Kaplan and Williams, 2013), but these studies examine the relevance of GC opinions independent of other MAOs.  Our empirical results on the effect of GC opinions on various loan terms, relative to the effect of other MAOs, shed light on the unique value of the auditor's information that is not available in the financial statements or through other channels accessible to sophisticated lenders (Mutchler, 1985.  Menon and Schwartz, 1987).  In the next section we develop our hypotheses.  We describe the sample selection procedures and variables used in this study in Section 3.  Section 4 presents the main empirical results, and Section 5 presents the results of additional analyses.  A summary and conclusions are provided in Section 6.  2.  Background and hypothesis development.  As capital providers, lenders are interested in ensuring the timely repayment of the loan and interest that are claims on the borrower's future cash flow and assets.  When contemplating a potential loan recipient, banks and other lenders analyze the risk of default, estimate the market value and liquidation values of assets, and evaluate the management's character and ability (Tirole, 2007).  If lenders decide to initiate a loan after the credit analysis, they negotiate the price and non-price terms of the debt contract, which compensate them for risk and allow them to monitor the borrower's performance over the life of the loan.  Audited financial statements provide important information to lenders for evaluating the borrower's credit worthiness and default risk (e. g. , Beaver, 1966.  Altman, 1968.  Ohlson, 1980), and auditors play an important role in this process. 7 The audit report is the primary means by which the auditor communicates to users their degree of assurance that the financial statements reflect the firm's economic activities.  To arrive at an opinion, the auditor amasses a large body of evidence and offers insights into the estimates and assumptions underlying the financial reports prepared by managers.  The auditor uses explanatory language in the audit report to communicate material concerns discovered during the auditing process that may be relevant to users.  These include Inconsistency concerns, arising from an accounting change or restatement, and Inadequacy concerns, relating to material uncertainty or an outright GC opinion.  The severity of the auditor's concern is reflected in the content of explanatory language included in the report, which is useful to lenders when negotiating debt agreements.  Since Inconsistency opinions refer to accounting changes or restatements that are usually disclosed in the notes of financial reports, they may not be incrementally informative to lenders.  Auditors, however, have some discretion in whether to include these items, rather than being required to include them in the audit report as a form of mechanical compliance with accounting standards. 8 In addition, Inconsistency opinions may turn a lender's attention to the issue of incomparable information in financial statements when contemplating a debt contract. 9 Prior work (Czerney et al. , 2013) provides evidence that explanatory language mentioning accounting changes and restatements is associated with a higher probability of subsequent misstatements.  Graham et al.  (2008) find that earnings restatements are associated with increases in price and non-price costs of debt, which is consistent with financial restatements leading to higher information uncertainty. 10 These studies suggest that Inconsistency opinions may still affect the direct or indirect cost of debt.  Another reason that audit opinions may be relevant in debt contracting is through auditors’ communication of private information about a borrower's credit risk and financial health.  For lenders, Inadequacy opinions (especially GC opinions) are particularly relevant because they convey an auditor's judgment about potential losses or default risks that might not be reflected elsewhere in the financial report.  Therefore, the effect of MAOs related to Inadequacy opinions should be greater than the effect of Inconsistency opinions.  With respect to GC opinions, prior studies find that these opinions are associated with a higher probability of bankruptcy (Mutchler, 1985.  Menon and Schwartz, 1987.  Hopwood et al. , 1989.  Raghunandan and Rama, 1995.  Mutchler et al. , 1997).  These findings are consistent with the effectiveness of SAS 59 which provides guidance to auditors in evaluating a client's ability to continue as a going concern.  We predict that the effect of GC opinions on price and non-price loan terms will be greater than the effects of the other MAO opinions. 11 If MAOs communicate relevant information about the quality of financial reports or about a client's credit risk, then lenders should respond with higher interest rates to reflect borrowers’ greater credit risk and the additional costs of monitoring using alternative mechanisms.  Furthermore, we predict that the effect on interest rates varies with the severity of issues identified in the MAO.  This leads to our first empirical hypothesis, stated as follows.  H1.  Compared with loans issued in the year after a clean opinion, loans in the year after an MAO have higher loan spreads.  In addition, the effect on spread is greater for GC opinions than for other MAO types.  The monitoring of a borrower's behavior through debt covenants to mitigate agency conflicts between shareholders and debtholders is an important part of debt contracting (Jensen and Meckling, 1976.  Smith and Warner, 1979).  In the case of covenant violation, control rights can be transferred quickly to lenders.  Accounting information and financial ratios are widely used to monitor borrowers’ performance in debt covenants.  A pre-condition for using financial covenants is the assurance that the accounting information reflects the borrower's actual performance.  If accounting numbers are of questionable quality, lenders may use general covenants that do not rely on accounting information.  General covenants often specify events that would require the borrower to pay down the balance of their loan, whether dividends may be paid, or the allowed uses of borrowed funds.  If lenders view an MAO as decreasing the value of including financial covenants, then they may compensate by increasing the number of general covenants.  Alternatively, if financial and general covenants are independent in purpose, the optimal number (and type) of included general covenants may already be included and no change will be observed.  The implications of an MAO for debt covenants vary by the type of modified opinion.  If Inconsistency opinions are indicators of a high likelihood of subsequent misstatements, then financial covenants become less effective as a monitoring tool (Czerney et al. , 2013).  Further, the effects of Inadequacy opinions on covenant choices should be stronger than the effects of Inconsistency opinions, because Inadequacy MAOs convey an auditor's greater concern regarding potential losses or default risk not reflected in financial statements.  In particular, GC opinions may indicate that a basic assumption of the accounting model (i. e.  that the firm will persist as a going concern) is violated, undermining the usefulness of the financial statements to lenders as an effective monitoring tool.  To protect their investments, lenders will identify alternative measures for liquidation values of assets.  We expect the effect on the use of debt covenants in loan contracts to be strongest for GC opinions.  Stated in the alternative form, our second hypothesis is H2.  Compared with loans issued in the year after a clean opinion, loans issued in the year after an MAO are associated with a decrease in the number of financial covenants and/or an increase in the number of general covenants.  In addition, the effect of GC opinions is stronger than those of other MAO types.  To assess the total effect on the contract design of an MAO, it is important to consider the many different contract provisions from which lenders can choose (Gigler et al. , 2009).  Up to this point, we have considered only the use of spread and covenants in contract design.  In reality, lenders also consider other loan terms to protect themselves.  We consider the effects of an MAO on three additional contracting terms.  loan size, the requirement of collateral, and the maturity of the loan.  If lenders view an MAO as a disclosure event that communicates a negative signal about the borrower's financial reporting quality and credit risk, we predict that lenders will be more likely to reduce loan size, require collateral, and shorten the loan maturity after an MAO.  As before, the relevant effects should vary for different types of MAOs.  Therefore, we expect that Inadequacy MAOs have a greater effect on these loan terms than Inconsistency MAOs.  Economic theory on credit rationing (see, e. g. , Jaffee and Russell, 1976.  Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981) proposes that loan size is not a linear function of the signaled default risk, because credit risk may increase if the loan size can only finance riskier small projects.  As a result, rather than reducing the loan size, lenders may simply deny the loan application after an MAO, especially after a GC opinion.  Similar to loan size, Diamond's (1991) theory suggests that debt maturity is a non-monotonic function of a firm's default risk, with low risk firms obtaining both short- and long-term debt, while high risk firms are forced to borrow at maturities shorter than they desire because of the moral hazard of asset substitution.  Finally, we expect GC opinions to have a stronger effect than the other three types of MAOs on the likelihood of a loan requiring collateral.  Stated in the alternative form, we predict that H3.  Compared with loans issued in the year after a clean opinion, loans issued in the year after an MAO are smaller in size, more likely to require collateral, and shorter in maturity.  In addition, the effect of GC opinions is larger than those of other MAO types.  <Middle> Research design and sample selection.  3. 1.  Research design.  To examine the relevance of audit opinions in debt contracting, we select those firms with at least one MAO in our sample period so that we can isolate the effects attributable to MAOs.  We perform empirical tests of the effect of an MAO on the contract terms of loans issued in the year after an MAO by estimating the following model, where Loan Term is a variable representing the specific contracting terms of the loan agreement that we investigate including.  interest spread, number of financial covenants, number of general covenants, loan size, whether or not a loan requiring collateral, and maturity length of a loan.  MAO is an indicator variable equal to one if the loan is initiated in the year after the borrower receives an MAO, and zero otherwise.  To examine whether there is any lingering effect on contract terms for loans initiated beyond the first year after an MAO, we include After_MAO to capture any continuing effect of an MAO after a borrower receives a clean opinion.  After_MAO is an indicator variable equal to one if a firm currently has a clean opinion but had an MAO in at least one of the previous three years, and zero otherwise.  We expect MAO to have a positive (β1) effect on loan spread, use of general covenants, and likelihood of requiring collateral, but a negative (β1) effect on the use of financial covenants, loan size, and maturity length.  To investigate the differential effects of different types of MAOs on debt contracts, we replace the generic MAO with the types of MAOs.  We first examine the relevance of MAOs for loan spreads after controlling for the other known determinants of interest rates.  We control for firm size, because small firms have greater information asymmetry and higher default risk (Pittman and Fortin, 2004.  Bharath et al. , 2007).  We control for loan size, because larger loans are priced at lower interest rates (Booth, 1992.  Beatty et al. , 2002).  We include a number of controls related to financial distress found in the prior literature.  Z-score, market-to-book, leverage, cash flow volatility, tangibility, and credit and term spreads (Graham et al. , 2008).  We include a measure of abnormal accruals which have been shown to affect interest rates (Bharath et al. , 2008), as well as, a control for revolvers, because these loans have a lower loan spread than term loans (Zhang, 2008).  Institutional loans, relative to bank loans, have a higher loan spread because of the higher information symmetry with the borrower.  We control for the existence of performance pricing provisions, because they reduce adverse selection and moral hazard costs for lenders (Asquith et al. , 2005).  We also control for the number of lenders in the loan.  A larger number of participants in the loan syndicate indicate a higher quality borrower and less information asymmetry between syndicate participants.  Last, we control for other contracting devices available to lenders.  loan maturity, collateral, number of financial covenants, loan purpose, and year fixed effects. 12 To mitigate the influence of outliers, we winsorize all continuous variables at the top and bottom 1% of their respective distributions.  We also adjust standard errors using two-way firm and year clusters in all regressions.  To test H2 we include a similar set of control variables in testing the effects of MAOs on the use of financial and general covenants.  In these empirical models, we include loan interest rate as a control variable, because agency theory on debt covenants predicts a negative relation between loan spread and the use of covenants (Jensen and Meckling, 1976.  Smith and Warner, 1979).  We select other control variables similar to those in prior studies on the determinants of covenants in debt contracting (Beatty et al. , 2002.  Sufi, 2007.  Graham et al. , 2008.  Costello and Wittenberg-Moerman, 2011).  In testing H3, we follow a similar procedure to include control variables when we examine the effects of MAOs on loan size, likelihood of requiring collateral, and loan maturity.  3. 2.  Data sources and sample selection.  We obtain data on MAOs in audit reports from COMPUSTAT (variable name AUOP) for the period from 1992 to 2009. 13 We match our MAO sample with public firms in the Dealscan database, which contains contractual terms such as interest rate, size, collateral requirement, and covenants, of loans issued in the United States. 14 To be included in our sample, we require borrowers to obtain a loan during the window just after an MAO (in either the year of MAO or within the three years following the first clean opinion after an MAO) and outside of the MAO window (either before the MAO or more than three years after the first clean opinion following an MAO).  This requirement is to ensure that our results are not attributable to differences between MAO and non-MAO borrowers.  After eliminating observations with missing data needed in our analyses, our final sample includes 8473 loans issued to 5377 borrowers during the 1992–2009 period. 15 To classify MAOs based on the stated reasons for modification, we read the explanatory paragraph section of the audit report for each MAO identified above from the borrower's 10-K on EDGAR or LexisNexis.  Following Butler et al.  (2004), we classify the reason for each MAO into one of two broad categories.  Inconsistency and Inadequacy. 16 Inconsistency MAOs refer to a lack of consistency according to GAAP accounting principles (AU Section 508), and we break down Inconsistency into Accounting Change and Restatement depending on whether the auditor mentions accounting changes or restatements in the explanatory paragraph. 17 Likewise, we decompose Inadequacy MAOs into two types.  Material Uncertainty and GC Opinion.  We classify an MAO as Material Uncertainty if the auditor mentions a business uncertainty, litigation risk, or contingent liability in the audit report, and we classify an MAO as GC Opinion if the auditor mentions going concern, bankruptcy, financing difficulty, or distress.  4.  Empirical results.  4. 1.  Audit opinions and loan spreads.  Table 3 presents the effects of modified opinions on loan spreads.  We regress loan spread on MAO, After_MAO, and a set of control variables.  Our first hypothesis predicts that if lenders view the auditor's MAO as a negative indicator of financial reporting quality and/or of the borrower's credit risk, then loans issued after an MAO will have a higher interest rate than loans issued after a clean audit opinion.  In addition, if an MAO has a lingering effect, even after the MAO has been removed, then debt issued during the after-MAO period will have a higher spread as well.  In Column 1, the coefficient on MAO is positive and statistically significant.  loans initiated after an MAO have a spread over LIBOR 17. 31 basis points higher than loans issued during a non-MAO period.  This represents an increase in the interest spread of 8. 6%. 18 In Column 2, we report a significant incremental effect on loan spreads for Inadequacy modifications, 92. 14 basis points, but no effect for Inconsistency modifications.  Column 3 reports that firms with GC Opinion, Material Uncertainty, and Restatement MAOs experience significant increases in their loan spreads of 107. 13, 49. 37, and 25. 27 basis points, respectively.  The result that MAOs issued because of an accounting change have no effect on the borrower's interest spread is consistent with these modifications being less of a concern to lenders and resulting in no interest spread effect for borrowers.  In contrast, the significant coefficients of the other three types of MAOs suggest that they raise the cost of loans to the borrower, increasing with the severity of the MAO.  The incremental effect on spread of GC Opinion is significantly larger than any of the other three MAOs, and it represents a 53. 4% increase relative to the non-MAO period. 19 These results support H1.  Many of the included control variables are statistically significant.  Spreads are negatively associated with whether or not the loan is a revolver, loan size, loan maturity, inclusion of a performance pricing provision, firm size, market-to-book, borrower profitability, and Z-score.  Spreads are positively associated with whether or not the loan is institutional, whether or not the borrower provides collateral, leverage, cash flow volatility, abnormal accruals, and credit spread.  After_MAO is positive but not statistically significant across all specifications, providing no evidence that lenders continue to charge higher interest rates to borrowers who recently received MAOs.  Generally, control variables are significant in the predicted direction.  one notable exception is the coefficient on maturity, which is negative and statistically significant.  It is opposite to the predicted relation between loan maturity and interest rate for a given borrower.  However, the negative coefficient is consistent with theory work which predicts that loans with long maturity are issued to firms with the lowest credit risk, and that high credit risk firms can only borrow at short or medium maturity terms (Diamond, 1991).  This is because the increase in interest spread in long maturities induces high risk borrowers to take on riskier projects despite their desire to secure loans with long maturity.  As a result, we may observe a less positive or even negative coefficient on loan maturity in a pooled sample of loans to borrowers with differential credit risk.  4. 2.  Audit opinions and use of financial and general covenants.  Table 4 presents the effects of MAOs on the use of financial and general covenants.  H2 states that lenders will be less willing to rely on financial covenants in debt contracts after the quality of the financial statements is brought into question by a modified opinion from an auditor.  The first column in Table 4 provides evidence that the number of financial covenants included in a debt contract is lower in the MAO and after-MAO periods.  The coefficient on MAO is  0. 10 and statistically significant, representing a decrease in the use of financial covenants by 3. 8%.  Column 2 shows a decrease in the use of financial covenants after MAOs related to both Inadequacy ( 0. 17) and Inconsistency ( 0. 10).  Column 3 provides the results for each type of MAO and shows that decreases in the use of financial covenants are driven by GC Opinion and Accounting Change.  In contrast, the coefficients on Restatement and Material Uncertainty are not statistically significant.  The coefficient on After_MAO is negative and significant across all three specifications, which indicates that lenders are reluctant to include financial covenants for up to three years after a clean opinion is restored to the borrower.  This suggests a lingering effect of MAOs on the use of financial covenants.  H2 also predicts that lenders will increase the use of general covenants in loans after an MAO.  Column 4 of Table 4 provides evidence consistent with this hypothesis.  The coefficient on MAO is 0. 22 and statistically significant, and it indicates an average increase in the use of general covenants of 4. 2%.  This finding provides evidence consistent with our prediction that when lenders cannot rely on accounting numbers in debt contracts, they increase their use of the nonaccounting debt covenants.  In contrast to the use of financial covenants, the coefficient on After_MAO is insignificant.  Column 5 shows that the use of general covenants increases after both Inadequacy and Inconsistency modifications, and Column 6 provides evidence that the use of general covenants increases after all MAOs except those related to restatements.  The largest effect (0. 95) relates to material uncertainty MAOs, those modifications in which the auditor mentions business uncertainty, litigation risk, or contingent liability issues.  This result provides evidence that one way that lenders respond to a potential loss/liability conveyed by an MAO is through the increased use of general covenants.  As in tests of H1, many of the control variables are as predicted and statistically significant.  Overall, our empirical results regarding the effects of MAOs on the use of financial and general covenants are consistent with H2.  4. 3.  Audit opinions and use of additional loan terms.  H3 predicts that lenders will include more stringent non-accounting loan terms after an MAO.  We investigate three nonaccounting mechanisms that lenders can include in debt contracts.  loan size, requirement of collateral, and loan maturity length, and we report the results in Table 5.  Columns 1–3 of Table 5 provide evidence that lenders decrease the loan sizes offered to borrowers with all types of MAOs except those related to material uncertainties.
