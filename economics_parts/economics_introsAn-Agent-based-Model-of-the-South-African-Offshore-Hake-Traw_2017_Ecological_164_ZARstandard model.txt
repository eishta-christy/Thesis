The most valuable component in South Africa's ﬁshing industry is its
hake ﬁshery, which targets two species, the shallow-water (Merluccius
capensis) and deep-water (M.  paradoxus) Cape hakes.  It accounts N50%
of overall ﬁsheries value in the country (Butterworth and Rademeyer,
2005.  Powers Name, 2010), with landed catch worth approximately
ZAR (South African Rand) 2. 5 billion in 2008 (Petersen Name, 2010),
and is presently estimated at ±ZAR 5 billion (Durholtz, 2014, personal
communication). 
It also generates approximately 30,000 jobs
(Rademeyer Name, 2008a), and is estimated to comprise as much as
half of all ﬁsh eaten in the country (Bacela Name, 2003).  The largest sector of the hake ﬁshery is offshore demersal trawling, which lands 85% of
the catch (Field Name, 2013), and is an important contributor to the large
post-1990 export market for South African hake (Crosoer Name, 2006). 
It is known that when ﬁsheries are managed for long-term sustainability and only the ecological context is considered, while human aspects are ignored, failure of management often results.  Therefore, the
international literature generally acknowledges that ﬁsheries need to
be managed with economic and social objectives in addition to ecological
ones (Browman and Stergiou, 2005.  Folke Name, 2007.  Garcia and
Charles, 2008.  Pitcher and Lam, 2010).  A better understanding of the
economic structure and function of the hake industry and its interaction
and connection to the ecological system, will serve to inform management.  Successful actions related to sustainability are underpinned
through the linkages of ecosystems to social and economic systems
(Folke Name, 2007).  Furthermore, a current scientiﬁc challenge is to ﬁnd
coherence among the economic, social, ecological and institutional sectors of ﬁsheries through the utilization of all pertinent knowledge
(Garcia and Charles, 2008).  As a step towards this, modelling provides
a means to assist in understanding the dynamics of the economic system
and identify potential links to the ecological system.  Modelling is an approach that can be used to test understanding, synthesize knowledge and
make predictions.  Blackford Name (2010), and Starﬁeld and Jarre (2011)
suggest that it is a useful means of conducting interdisciplinary research. 
In the hake industry, several economic factors are known to have importance for the hake ﬁshing industry.  Exchange rate and market value
of ﬁsh affect the ZAR price of hake, fuel price and catch per unit effort reﬂect the cost to companies to catch hake, and industrial organization affects company operations (see for example BCLME, 2004, 2006).  Many of
these factors, such as fuel price (Sumaila Name, 2008) and exchange rate
(Asche, 2014) are known to be important internationally for ﬁsheries
proﬁtability.  The interaction of these and other variables affect company
behaviour, and proﬁts.  To understand the function of the South African
offshore hake trawl industry, it is therefore valuable to produce a novel
prototype model to examine the effect on and relative importance of
these and other factors for the industry.  The aim of this study is to develop and describe an agent-based model that captures a variety of these
important drivers for the industry (Fig.  1).  This model is designed within
the framework of ultimately linking it to an ecosystem model of the
Southern Benguela. 
There is much complexity involved in the industrial structure of companies and company clusters in the offshore hake industry, as well as variability in the types of product that they sell and their ﬂeet compositions
(Cooper Name, 2014).  Given this complexity and the heterogeneity of ﬁshing vessels, companies and markets involved in the industry, agent-based
modelling is particularly well suited for modelling it.  Agent-based models
(ABMs) capture complex systems comprised of heterogeneous, autonomous entities, ‘agents’, that interact with each other and their modelled
environment through behaviours governed by simple rules, and which
give rise to the behaviour of the system as a whole (Macal and North,
2010).  ABMs allow the capturing of individual-level information, complexity, interdisciplinary and cross-scale perspectives, giving greater predictive and explanatory power (An Name, 2005), particularly in the
broader ecological-economic context within which the present model is
developed.  Computational models like ABMs have the advantages of
being able to deal with complex, stochastic systems, and of being able
to model how the activities of elements at one scale have impacts on patterns observed at another scale (Levin Name, 1997).  They allow the modelling of heterogeneous economic agents and therefore represent a new
and alternate way of modelling and understanding economic systems
(Deissenberg Name, 2008).  This may be especially advantageous in modelling the economics of resource-extraction systems, such as ﬁsheries,
where not only are the economic agents heterogeneous but where
environmental heterogeneity also plays an important role (Nolan Name,
2009).  Despite these advantages ABMs have not often been applied to
economic aspects of ﬁsheries, and this represents a signiﬁcant area for development.  Previous applications in ﬁsheries have often centred around
the topic of understanding ﬂeet dynamics and ﬁshing strategies
(Bastardie Name, 2010.  Boschetti and Brede, 2009.  Cabral Name, 2010. 
Little Name, 2004.  Schafer, 2007.  Soulié and Thébaud, 2006.  Wilson Name, 2007.  Yu Name, 2009), where they have provided some useful insights
into ﬂeet behaviour and the way that resources are used.  Little Name
(2009), for example, has taken the ﬂeet effort allocation scenario a step
further and examined how individual transferable quotas affect a multispecies, multi-sector ﬁshery in terms of ﬁshing ﬂeet behaviour,
discarding, catch-levels, proﬁtability and so forth (Little Name, 2009). 
The present paper forms the ﬁrst of a two-part publication and will
describe the development and validation of an agent-based model of
the South African offshore hake trawling industry.  The second, upcoming
paper will explore a variety of scenarios with the model to examine interactions and trade-offs of external drivers and market organization. 
The layout of this ﬁrst paper is as follows.  ﬁrst, brief and relevant background information and how this informed the model design and development is described.  Then, in the results section the initial validation and
testing of the model, including its sensitivities, are described.  Finally, the
summary and conclusion section examines the contribution of the model
to the bio-economic modelling literature, the potential applications of
the model, its relevance to management and possibilities for linkages
to an ecological model in future.

2. 1.  The Offshore Trawl Fishery as It Relates to Model Design. 
Given the dominance of the offshore demersal hake trawl sector in
catch (85%) and exports of South Africa's ﬁnancially important hake ﬁshery (Butterworth and Rademeyer, 2005.  Field Name, 2013.  Powers Name,
2010), a detailed study was made of its industry.  Details of this study can
be found in Cooper Name (2014), but a brief and relevant summary is provided here in relation to the model structure.  The industry of the demersal hake ﬁshery is highly vertically integrated, with many of the
companies involved in most aspects of the value chain from catching
and processing of ﬁsh to its distribution.  Fishing rights are issued to individuals (henceforth “rightsholders”) in the hake industry rather than to
vessels or companies.  These rights have been allocated for 15 years (ending 2021) and are a ﬁxed percentage of the total allowable catch, which is
allocated annually on the basis of a two-species operational management procedure (Table 1.  Rademeyer Name, 2008b).  Horizontal consolidation of rights is important.  Although the industry comprises 52
rightsholders these are consolidated into seven company clusters
through various catch share and joint venture agreements1 (Cooper Name, 2014).  Each cluster effectively functions as a single company or ﬁshing business entity.  Based on their operations, four categories of company clusters can be deﬁned.  large, medium, small and super-cluster.  These
differ in the number and types of vessels owned, rights-shares, processing efﬁciency (i. e.  efﬁciency with which companies can convert whole,
raw ﬁsh to ﬁnished product) and business strategies (Cooper Name,
2014).  The ﬁrst agent class in the model is company clusters, and
based on the industry structure as at 2013, there are four types of these
agents.  small, medium, large and super-cluster agents. 
The company clusters operate and mostly possess their own ﬂeets of
trawlers (and normally employ the skippers and crews on a permanent
basis).  Vessels from the offshore trawl industry may be classiﬁed as a)
freezer stern trawlers and b) factory freezer trawlers, both of which
store the ﬁsh at sea in on-board freezers and consequently land frozen
ﬁsh, or c) wetﬁsh stern trawlers, which store ﬁsh chilled on ice and
land their catch fresh (unfrozen) within a few days (see Table 2).  These
three vessel types are represented as different types of the modelled vessel agent class.  Two types of hake are represented in the model, fresh and
frozen hake, to capture and distinguish the two ways it can be landed
and consequently processed and sold on.  Joint products (i. e.  other landed
species) are not considered in the model at this stage, since although
some can be high-value, they are non-target species and represent only
a small proportion of landings and exports. 
Depending on the vessel type the ﬁsh may be partially or completed
processed at sea.  In the case of unprocessed or partially processed, after
ﬁsh is landed it is processed ashore in large factories.  Processed ﬁsh
(i. e.  ﬁnal hake product) is sold to distributors and exporters.  Some of
the large companies that perform distribution and export also sell directly to clients.  Clients of ﬁshing companies are frequently domestic or international retail chains and wholesale distributors.  It is difﬁcult to
identify individual international clients and volumes of ﬁsh purchased. 
Markets for hake were therefore treated at the country level in the
model.  In a separate study by Cooper (2015), a comprehensive analysis
of TradeMap export data revealed the major international markets for
hake, i. e.  those markets who imported N500 t of South African hake per
annum for the data period (Fig.  2).  These countries were Spain, Italy, Portugal, United Kingdom (UK), Australia, France, Germany, the United
States of America (USA) and the Netherlands.  They were all represented
as client agents in the model, along with one substitute agent that collectively represented the total demand of all other small importing countries (those countries that imported b500 t of hake per annum) and
one agent that represented the South African domestic market. 
In summary, the agent-based model was informed by the industry
structure during 2013. 2 The model includes three types of vessel agents
that ‘catch’ and ‘land’ hake ﬁsh, four types of company cluster agents
that each operate as a single entity processing and marketing the hake,
and eleven types of client (i. e.  market) agents in the form of importing
foreign country markets and a domestic market for fresh and frozen
hake.  All agents can exchange hake, segregated as fresh and frozen ﬁsh
(in units of metric tonnes), and money (ZAR and Euros), which are all
consequently deﬁned as model currencies. 
2. 2.  Prototyping Approach. 
As part of the model development and implementation process, a
rapid prototyping approach was used.  Starﬁeld and Jarre (2011) suggest
this approach of building a ﬁnal model through a series of prototypes
with the ﬁrst built as fast and simply as possible, simplifying assumptions
listed and then the model tested.  Subsequent prototypes are then built in
much the same manner in incremental steps of complexity with full assumption listing and testing at each stage.  Rapid prototyping has several
advantages, including (i) not stalling the modelling process due to data
gaps or poor data and (ii) rapidly producing preliminary results that
allow an assessment of what the model is capable of, the direction the
model development could/should take, and reﬁnement or reconsideration of the model objectives (Starﬁeld and Jarre, 2011). 
As part of this process a thorough assumption analysis was carried
out.  Assumptions are created when something is omitted while creating
a simpliﬁed, purpose-built model of the real world (Starﬁeld and Jarre,
2011), and core behavioural assumptions, for example, often underpin
the mechanistic explanations of a model and it is therefore important
to test them (Tsang, 2006).  Pelletier and Mahévas (2005) state that
models for policy-related applications should be designed to allow for
the inclusion of various combinations of policy designs, parameter values
and model assumptions to ensure that the models are not overly dependent on any parameter value or model assumption.  A sound design and
thorough sensitivity analysis cover the ﬁrst two points, but an assumption analysis is essential to ensure that model behaviour is not overly dependent on any one assumption.  Assumption analysis can involve
examining whether observations from the real world are commensurate
with the assumptions made (Tsang, 2006).  Starﬁeld and Jarre (2011) explain that a thorough assumption analysis is as important as a sensitivity
analysis and should involve testing key assumptions through making
basic modiﬁcations to the model to determine how each assumption
might affect the models' results.  The assumption analysis for HakeSim
tests the effects of relaxing a variety of fundamental assumptions made
in the choice of model design to determine the full effect of the assumption.  This helps with the choice of the best model structure through a
process of elimination of assumptions, some of which might signiﬁcantly
affect model function while others may not.  It is essentially looking at a
trade-off between producing the simplest model possible and not making over-simplifying assumptions that would negatively affect model behaviour and usefulness (Starﬁeld and Jarre, 2011). 
During rapid prototyping, as each new procedure was added the
model was debugged and tested by varying inputs and examining outputs and model behaviour, until the ﬁnal prototype described in the
present manuscript was arrived at.  Procedures were independently tested and some of the sub-models were also independently implemented in
Microsoft Excel to verify their outputs, e. g.  the equation for vessel fullness after catches. 
Ad hoc testing was completed on the ﬁnal model prototype, in order
to test that the model was functioning.  Extreme values were used as inputs to the basic model interface, such as extremely low or high fuel
prices, unrealistic vessel numbers, all frozen or fresh ﬁsh situations, and
zero values for inputs, to determine whether the model behaved erratically.  Finally, a full sensitivity analysis was undertaken, and scenario
analyses were also conducted to examine whether the model had interesting and realistic behaviours.  These served as a foundation to more
complex analyses (Cooper and Jarre, 2017). 
2. 3.  Model Procedures. 
The model operates on a monthly time step, to match export and
landings data.  Individual years are also marked to update annual ﬁshing
allocations, e. g.  total allowable catch (TAC), and one complete model run
is ten years.  Since companies own and operate a particular ﬂeet of vessels, a suite of vessel agents are linked to a particular company agent
for the entire model run.  The number and types of vessel agents that
are linked to (i. e.  ‘operated’ by) each company agent are speciﬁed as a
model input in the initialization phase. 
In each time-step of the model a range of procedures occur.  These
sub-models and procedures have been categorized as three broad steps
below, for ease of explanation. 
2. 3. 1.  Vessel Activation and Fishing. 
Companies check whether there is a market demand for fresh or frozen ﬁsh and then activate fresh and/or freezer vessels one by one according to a randomly assigned rank number until all of the company's quota
weight assigned for that month is caught.  The maximum quantity of
hake that one company can catch in a single time step, Q, in tonnes per
month, is calculated as,
where R is the company's allocated ﬁshing right which is a ﬁxed percentage of the TAC.  TAC is the maximum quantity of hake (tonnes) allowed to
be caught in that year, it updates at the start of each modelled year and is
based on real time-series (appended Table A. 1).  Once activated, each
vessel executes a ﬁshing procedure, which determines the total landings
of that vessel for the monthly time step, as follows,
where L is the quantity of hake caught and landed by one active vessel on
a single ﬁshing trip (i. e.  in one monthly, time-step).  M is the maximum
capacity for hake (tonnes) that a ﬁshing vessel can land in one month. 
In the standard model run input values of M per vessel type are based
on the average number of trips vessels make per month and the average
maximum storage capacity per vessel type in the real South African ﬂeet
(c.  2013), see Table 2.  Depending on whether the vessel is a fresh-ﬁsh or
freezer vessel the landings will be separated as fresh (LFR) or frozen (LFZ)
hake in the model.  The SC is the stochasticity of catching ﬁsh and CPUE is
the catch per unit effort based on a transformed scale (from 0 to 1) of real
CPUE values (appended Table A. 2).  The deviation in CPUE is determined
by a number drawn from a random distribution between 0 and the SC. 
The vessel's monthly landing is determined by the ‘catchability’ of ﬁsh,
captured as CPUE and SC, a proxy for the environmental variability that
can affect individual catches.  Since recruitment and natural mortality of
hake are not well understood for the Southern Benguela (Nel Name,
2007), this crude proxy was the best ﬁrst attempt at capturing environmental variability that could be made. 
Once a company's monthly quota has been caught, a total operating
cost to the company of all active vessels for that time-step can be calculated.  Running costs and catch costs per landed tonne of fresh/frozen ﬁsh
differ between vessel types.  Given limited data, fuel consumption per
vessel type is assumed to be directly related to engine size (HP).  It is further assumed to be determined by daily fuel usage (with 265 days ﬁshing
per year) spread evenly across the 12 months of the year (based on company interviews that indicated ﬁshing activity to be almost consistent
through the year),
where FM is the vessel's fuel usage (l·month−1).  N is vessel engine size
(HP) and FD is daily fuel consumption per horsepower (l·HP−1·day−1). 
values for these in the standard model run are based on South African
offshore hake trawling industry data (see Table 3). 
The FM is used to calculate the fuel cost of an active ﬁshing vessel for a
one month time-step (AVCF) in South African Rands (ZAR),
where D is the fuel price (ZAR. l−1).  For a standard model run the average
diesel price paid by the offshore ﬁshing industry for the 2000–2012 time
series was used (Table 4). 
An active vessel accrues other costs (AVCO) in addition to fuel, such as
crew salaries and wages and additional variable costs directly related to
ﬁshing.
