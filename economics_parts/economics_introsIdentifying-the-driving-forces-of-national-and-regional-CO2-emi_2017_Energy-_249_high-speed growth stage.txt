In recent years, climate change has aroused worldwide attention,
and in-depth international discussions have been held to mitigate
climate change.  Since 2007, China has surpassed the US to become the
world's largest CO2 emitter, and thus becomes a focus of global efforts
to reduce CO2 emissions.  As one of the Parties to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, China has always been
promoting the implementation of the Convention and fulﬁlling its obligations.  Chinese government committed to reduce CO2 emissions per
unit of gross domestic production (GDP) by 40–45% towards 2020 at
2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Conference and by 60–65% towards
2030 at 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference.  To achieve such
challenging emission-reduction targets, China has attempted to adopt
effective policy instruments, such as the deployment of renewable
energy, the establishment of national carbon emission trading market. 
China has experienced a signiﬁcant increase in CO2 emissions in the
past decades (Liu Name, 2015).  Large variations in the growth pattern of
China's CO2 emissions at the regional level exist due to uneven distribution of initial resource endowment, economic scale, industry structure,
development stage etc.  (Meng Name, 2016).  CO2 emissions per capita
and CO2 emissions per unit of GDP among China's 30 regions also vary
sharply (Shan Name, 2016).  Emission-reduction targets for each region
should be set in considering the characteristics of socio-economic
development (Wang Name, 2016).  Therefore, it is necessary to explore
the driving forces of the variations of national and regional CO2 emissions of China in order to set accurate emission-reduction targets and
take effective measures from the perspective of national and regionalThis study explores the changes of national and regional CO2
emissions using temporal decomposition analysis model, and analyzes
the differences of CO2 emissions between China's 30 regions and the national average using spatial decomposition analysis model.  In addition,
this study evaluates the potential of emission-reduction of China's 30
regions.  The study did not only contribute to the energy saving and
emission reduction of China's CO2 emissions but also provide some
targeted suggestion for emission-reduction at regional and sectoralThe remainder of this study is organized as follows.  Section 2 reviews some existing literature.  Section 3 presents the models including
temporal and spatial decomposition analysis models and data sources
used in this study, and the overview of the national and regional CO2
emissions in China.  Section 4 depicts the decomposition results and
evaluates the potential of emission-reduction in China's 30 regions. 
Section 5 details further discussion of the deep-rooted reasons of key
factors with larger effect on CO2 emissions and the future tendency of
contribution of key factors.  Section 6 shows conclusion of the analysis,
with summary and policy implications. 
2.  Literature review. 
Existing studies have been conducted to analyze the driving forces of
the variations of national and regional CO2 emissions from the perspective of temporal and spatial level. 
First, tracking changes of CO2 emissions and quantifying the driving forces of the changes over time have long been a focus area of
researchers and policymakers.  Intensive studies have analyzed the
CO2 emissions and the driving forces of the change of CO2 emissions
at national (Wu Name, 2005.  Jung Name, 2012.  Cortés-Borda Name,
2015.  Sumabat Name, 2016.  van Ruijven Name, 2016), regional (Liang
Name, 2007.  Geng Name, 2013.  Wang Name, 2017) and industrial
level (Lin and Moubarak, 2013.  Xu and Lin, 2016a.  Talbi, 2017) overSecond, growing interest among researchers in comparing regions in
terms of CO2 emissions emerges in recent years.  The comparison allows
variations among countries or regions to be revealed, the contributing
factors identiﬁed, and the scope for improvement better understood
(Ang Name, 2016).  Many studies on analyzing the differences in CO2
emissions among different countries (Sun, 2000a, 2000b.  Zhang and
Ang, 2001.  Bataille Name, 2007), regions (Feng Name, 2009.  Su and Ang,
2016.  Xu and Lin, 2016b.  Wang Name, 2016.  Xu Name, 2016), and a speciﬁc sector among regions (Cui and Li, 2015.  Xu and Lin, 2016a, 2016c. 
Long Name, 2016) have also been conducted.  Besides, some studies are
also involved in the spatio-temporal analysis on the differences in regional CO2 emissions in recent years (Huang and Meng, 2013.  Kim
and Dall'erba, 2014.  Chen and Yang, 2015.  Ang Name, 2016).  Existing
literatures on the spatial analysis mainly focus on the differences in
CO2 emissions among regions from the perspective of production or a
speciﬁc production sector, and less literature are involved in householdDecomposition analysis is usually used to analyze the variations in
energy usage and emissions (Ang, 2015).  The model can not only
identify the main driving forces of the variations in an aggregation but
also show the clearly quantitative results of to what extent the driving
forces affect the variations (Su and Ang, 2012, 2015).  The logistics
mean Division index (LMDI) model is a preferred index decomposition
analysis approach because of the advantages of path independence,
residue free, ability to handle zero values, and consistency in aggregation (Ang, 2004).  Previous studies mainly adopted LMDI model to
study the determinants of variations of an aggregate based on the data
collected chronologically at different points in time for a speciﬁc region,
such as Ang and Liu (2001), Wang Name (2005), Mairet and Decellas
(2009), Wang and Li (2016), Shao Name (2016), Lin and Ahmad
(2017).  Therefore, this study uses LMDI method to conduct a temporal
decomposition analysis of the changes of national and regional CO2
emissions of China. 
Ang Name (2015) proposed a multi-regional (M-R) spatial decomposition model, which can be used to analyze why the differences in CO2
emissions exist among countries or among different regions within a
country.  The model shows an advantage in reducing decomposition
cases, avoiding subjectivity in benchmark region selection, maintaining
the property of circularity, and providing valuable information in terms
of the potential of energy-saving and emission-reduction.  Therefore,
this study adopts the M-R spatial decomposition model to compare
the CO2 emission performance of China's 30 regions. 
This study explores the driving forces of the changes of national and
regional CO2 emissions using LMDI model, and investigates the driving
forces of the differences of CO2 emissions between China's 30 regions
and the national average using multi-regional M-R spatial decomposition analysis model.  Compared with the existing studies, the main contributions of this study are as follows.  (1) We carry out an in-depth
analysis to uncover the main driving forces of the changes of national
and regional CO2 emissions in China, and to analyze the dominant
driving forces of the differences in CO2 emissions among China's 30
regions.  The study provides deep insights into why and what degree
the key factors affect national and regional CO2 emissions of China
from the perspective of temporal and spatial dimensions, and offers
policymakers references to formulate and implement targeted mitigation policies at both national and regional level.  (2) The original M-R
spatial decomposition analysis model is improved in this study.  On
one hand, household sector is introduced into the M-R spatial decomposition model for the ﬁrst time, and thus this study quantiﬁes the effects
of urbanization, income improvement and population.  On the other
hand, economic output and economic structure are introduced into
the model in aspect of production sector.  The improved temporal and
spatial decomposition analysis models in this study can be employed
to analyze the variation of an aggregation, such as energy, water,
waste, pollutants etc. , from the perspective of both production sector
and household sector.

3. 1.  Decomposition model. 
3. 1. 1.  Kaya identity. 
In the decomposition analysis framework, energy-related CO2
emissions are classiﬁed into two categories according to emission
sources.  energy-related CO2 emissions from production sector and
energy-related CO2 emissions from household sector.  National and
regional CO2 emissions in China can be decomposed into nine kinds of
driving forces, as shown in Eq.  (1). 
Where, i denotes each region in China.  j denotes the sectors involved in
this study (j=1,2,⋯,6 for agriculture, industry, construction, service,
urban residents and rural residents).  k denotes the energy type
consumed by each sector (k= 1, 2,⋯,12 for raw coal, coke, crude oil,
gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, LPG, reﬁnery gas, other petroleum
products, natural gas and electricity). 
The variables involved in the temporal and spatial decomposition
models are deﬁned in Tables 1 and 2. 
3. 1. 2.  Temporal decomposition analysis. 
Based on additive LMDI model proposed by Ang (2005), the
aggregate changes of CO2 emissions for each region of China between
the base year 0 and the target year T are decomposed into 9 driving
forces, see Eq.  (2), i. e. , carbon intensity effect, energy intensity effect
in the production sector, energy intensity effect in the household sector,
energy structure effect, industrial structure effect, urbanization effect,
economic scale effect, population scale effect and household income
improvement effect. 
The effects of various driving forces of regional CO2 emissions
between the base year 0 and the target year T for region i are calculated
using the following equations. 
3. 1. 3.  Spatial decomposition analysis. 
Spatial decomposition analysis is a popular useful in comparing
differences in energy consumption, energy efﬁciency or CO2 emissions
among regions within a country in a particular year (Su and Ang,
2016).  This study adopts the M-R spatial decomposition analysis
model to analyze the differences of CO2 emissions among different
regions in China.  In this spatial decomposition framework, each
targeted region is chosen to compare with a reference entity given by
the arithmetic average of the entire group.  In this study, China's 30
regions are ranked according to the descending order of the CO2
emissions, and the national average is chosen as the benchmark
reference for comparison for each pair.  The differences of CO2 emissions
between the regions i and the national average (∗), denoted as ΔCtot
(Ri−R∗), can be decomposed to give. 
Notably, carbon emission factors are constant for different fossil
energy, and carbon intensity effect including ΔCi, CIare always zero in the decomposition analysis.  Therefore, this study
considers the effects of other eight kinds of driving forces of national
and regional CO2 emissions in the following analysis. 
3. 2.  Data source, processing and variables. 
The study period is from 2000 to 2015, and is divided into 4 subperiods, i. e. , 2000–2005, 2006–2008, 2009–2012 and 2013–20,015 in
the temporal decomposition analysis.  The spatial scale includes China's
30 regions, which consists of 30 provinces and municipalities in mainland3. 2. 1.  Energy consumption (E) and CO2 emissions (C). 
The data for energy consumption and CO2 emissions of each region
in mainland China are derived from China Emission Accounts and
Datasets (CEADs). 2 National energy consumption and CO2 emissions
are the aggregation of China's 30 regional to ensure data consistency. 
The data for national and regional energy consumption are from
Energy Inventories for China and its 30 regions and cities in CEADs
(Seen Table A. 1).  The amount of energy consumption is measured by
million tons of standard coal equivalent (Mtce).  Twelve types of energy
resource are included in this study, i. e. , raw coal, coke, crude oil,
gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, LPG, reﬁnery gas, other petroleum
products, natural gas and electricity. 3
CEADs also publishes the latest CO2 emission inventories for China
and its 30 regions and cities, and two approaches are used to calculate
the CO2 emissions.  apparent emission accounting approach and the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sectoral approach. 
In this study, the data for CO2 emissions of each region are from
emission inventories by IPCC sectoral approach.  CO2 emissions for fossil
fuel consumption and for industrial processes by IPCC sectoral approach
are calculated based on Energy consumption data and Emission factors,
seen Eqs.  (22) and (23). 
Where, CEij represents the CO2 emissions of different sectors and energy
' represents the adjusted energy consumption.  NCVj repretypes.  ADij
sents the net caloriﬁc value of different energy types.  EFj refers to the
emission factors.  and Oij refers to the oxygenation efﬁciency of different
sectors and energy types. 
CEt represents the carbon emissions of industrial products, ADt
represents output of each industrial product and EFt represents the
emission factors for each industrial product. 
In addition, this study considers CO2 emissions from both fossil fuel
consumption and industrial processes when conducting overview
analysis of the national and regional CO2 emissions of China in
Section 2, and focuses on CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption
in the temporal and spatial decomposition analysis in Section 4. 
Energy-related CO2 emissions at national and regional level are
shown in Table A. 2. 
3. 2. 2.  Variables in socio-economic development. 
GDP, value-added of various sectors, disposable income and population in each region used in this study are obtained from China
Statistical Yearbook (NBSC, 2000-2015).  The multiple sectors are classiﬁed into two categories.  production sector (i. e. , agriculture, industry,
construction, and service sector) and household sector (i. e. , urban and
rural household sector) in our decomposition analysis framework. 
To study the driving forces of CO2 emissions of China, the variables including energy structure, energy intensity by sector, GDP, industrialization rate, urbanization rate, population, and urban and
rural disposable income per capita are chosen in this study. 4 The
details are as follows. 
3. 2. 2. 1.  Energy intensity.  During 2000–2015, most regions experienced
an inverted U-shaped evolution trend in energy intensity.  However, energy intensity in Ningxia showed a continuing increase trend.  In 2015,
Ningxia has the highest energy intensity of 273. 56 kg ce/1000 yuan,
followed by Shanxi, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, and the energy intensity of industrial sector reached 1034. 28 kg ce/1000 yuan which was
much higher than other regions in China.  Energy intensity of Beijing in
2015 is lowest among regions.  Energy intensity by sector of China's 30
regions in 2015 are shown in Table A. 3 in Appendix. 
3. 2. 2. 2.  GDP.  The data for GDP and value-added of various sectors from
2000 to 2015 are converted to the 2000 constant price to eliminate
the effect of inﬂation.  Compared with that of 2000, China's GDP in
2015 increased by 4. 08 times.  In general, Guangdong has the largest
scale of GDP, while Ningxia has the lowest scale of GDP.  During 2000–
2015, average annual growth rate of GDP for each region exceed 10%,
in which it reached 14. 79% in Inner Mongolia.  GDP of China's 30 regions
are shown in Table A. 4 in Appendix. 
3. 2. 2. 3.  Industrialization.  Industrial sector consumes large amount of fossil energy resource, and thus emits large amount of CO2.  Value-added of
industrial sector affects CO2 emissions severely.  This study uses industrialization rate, i. e. , the ratio of industrial value-added to total GDP, to
measure the change of industrial structure.  Industrialization rate of
Heilongjiang and Tianjin are larger than other regions in China, whereas
Hainan is the lowest during 2000–2015.  Due to the development of
service sector, the share of industrial value-added in most regions
declined in recent years.  Industrialization rate of China's 30 regions
are shown in Table A. 5 in Appendix. 
3. 2. 2. 4.  Urbanization.  Urbanization is the important factor to inﬂuence
energy consumption and CO2 emissions because residential income
and energy efﬁciency would improve in the process of urbanization. 
This study employs the ratio of urban population to total population
to measure the level of urbanization.  Generally, urbanization rate of
China has been growing from 35. 50% in 2000 to 55. 44% in 2015. 
Shanghai and Beijing are the two regions with highest urbanization
rate of 88. 62% and 86. 42% in 2015, respectively.  However, urbanization
rate in Guizhou remained 41. 01% in 2015.  Urbanization rate of China's
30 regions are shown in Table A. 6 in Appendix. 
3. 2. 2. 5.  Population.  Since NBSC provides the data on year-end population
in urban and rural area, this study takes the average of population at the
beginning and end of the year.  Population in most regions increased
slowly during 2000–2015, with an average annual growth rate of
0. 58%.  However, affected by labor transfer, growth rate of population
reached 4. 33% in Tianjin, 3. 22% in Beijing and 2. 69% in Shanghai. 
Notably, population in Anhui declined during 2000–2015.  Population
of China's 30 regions are shown in Table A. 7 in Appendix. 
3. 2. 2. 6.  Disposable income per capita.  As income rises, more energy resources are consumed to support the use of electrical appliances, and
then more CO2 are emitted.  In this study, disposable income per capita
by eliminating inﬂation is used to measure the real level of income.  During 2000–2015, most regions in China showed high-speed increase in
disposable income per capita, with an average annual growth rate of
8. 85% in urban region and 8. 56% in rural region.  Shanghai and Beijing
are two regions with highest disposable income per capita of both
urban and rural residents.  However, Qinghai has lowest urban disposable income per capita and Gansu is the region with lowest rural disposable income per capita.  Urban and rural disposable income per capita of
China's 30 regions are shown in Tables A. 8 and A. 9 in Appendix. 
3. 3.  Overview of the national and regional CO2 emissions in China. 
This section analyzes the performance of China's CO2 emissions at
both national and regional levels.  First, the evolution trends of national
CO2 emissions in China during 2000–2015 are investigated, and then
the whole study period is divided into different time intervals in
considering the evolution trends of national CO2 emissions.  Second,
CO2 emissions of China's 30 regions and three big regions between
2000 and 2015 are compared. 
3. 3. 1.  National CO2 emissions. 
There has been a signiﬁcant increase in China's CO2 emissions from
3397. 62 million tons (Mt. ) in 2000 to 9403. 00 Mt.  in 2015 at an average
annual growth rate of 7. 02%.  As shown in Fig.  1a, the changes in national
CO2 emissions mainly runs through four stages.  high-speed growth
stage (2000–2005), decreasing-speed growth stage (2006–2008),
steady growth stage (2009–2012) and transition stage (2013–2015). 
During 2000–2005, growth rate of national CO2 emissions increased
from 4.
