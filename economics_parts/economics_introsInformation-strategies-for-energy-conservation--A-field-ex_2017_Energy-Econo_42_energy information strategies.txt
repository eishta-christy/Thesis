 1.  Introduction Strategies that provide information about the environmental impact of activities are increasingly seen as an effective way to encourage conservation behavior (Evans et al. , 2009).  The environmental impact of everyday activities is often invisible to consumers who cannot gauge the impact of their actions.  Information strategies that aim to correct this information asymmetry are increasingly common (Foulon et al. , 2002.  Kennedy et al. , 1994).  These include mercury and air pollution advisories (Cutter and Neidell, 2009.  Shimshack and Ward, 2010.  Shimshack et al. , 2007.  Zivin and Neidell, 2009).  mandatory and voluntary corporate disclosure (Bennear and Olmstead, 2008.  Delmas et al. , 2010.  Evans et al. , 2009.  Khanna, 2001.  Konar and Cohen, 1997.  Lyon and Maxwell, 2007.  Powers et al. , 2011) and ecolabels (Hallstein and Villas-Boas, 2013.  Teisl et al. , 2002).  Such strategies are based on the principle that more and better information about the environmental impact of activities will encourage consumers to conserve.  Electricity conservation has been an especially active context for the deployment of information strategies.  Electricity and heat generation accounts for over 40% of greenhouse gases across the world (International Energy Agency, 2014) and effective conservation programs could contribute to signiﬁcant environmental improvements.  A large number of energy conservation experiments have been conducted using various information strategies to reduce energy use (Allcott, 2011.  Allcott and Rogers, 2014.  Asensio and Delmas, 2015.  Delmas and Lessem, 2014.  Jessoe and Rapson, 2014).  These include providing users with energy saving tips, historical individual usage, real time energy usage, peer usage, etc.  Meta-analyses of these ﬁeld experiments ﬁnd these strategies to be effective for conservation (Delmas et al. , 2013), although effectiveness varies with the type of message provided.  However, until very recently (McRae, 2015.  Pellerano et al.  2015), there have been no ﬁeld experiments in developing countries that focus on information strategies for energy conservation behavior.  Indeed, a recent meta-analysis based on 156 ﬁeld trials published in peer-reviewed journals from 1975 to 2012 found that 100% of the studies were conducted in developed countries, mostly Europe and the United States (Delmas et al. , 2013).  Developing countries differ in many characteristics from developed countries, including income and education levels, and information technology infrastructure, and it is unclear how energy information strategies would perform in such contexts.  For example, conducting ﬁeld experiments in developing countries could allow researchers to provide meaningful monetary gains and losses with the same amount that would be considered trivial in developed countries (Harrison and List, 2004.
