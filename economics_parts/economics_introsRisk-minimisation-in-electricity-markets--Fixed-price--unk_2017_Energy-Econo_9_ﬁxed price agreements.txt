 1.  Introduction 1. 1.  The problem.  A popular product sold by energy companies to medium-to-large customers is one where an unspeciﬁed amount of power can be bought at a ﬁxed price during a certain time-interval.  We call this a ﬁxed price, unspeciﬁed consumption contract or simply a ﬁxed price agreement.  The business-to-business electricity market in Denmark in 2014 was 23. 1 TWh, about MEUR 800 million in monetary terms.  60% was sold as ﬁxed price agreements in some form.  Having entered into the ﬁxed price agreement, the energy company must asses and manage the risks associated with the obligations of the contract.
