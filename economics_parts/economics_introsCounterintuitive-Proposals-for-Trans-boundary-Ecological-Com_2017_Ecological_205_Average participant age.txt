 1.  Introduction 1. 1.  No Net Loss.  Environmental policies and legislation that incorporate a ‘no net loss’ (NNL) of biodiversity objective have been widely adopted over recent decades (Maron et al. , 2016).  The theoretical assumption underlying all approaches to NNL is that if the negative biodiversity impacts associated with economic development are quantiﬁed, and commensurate biodiversity gains correspondingly achieved through additional conservation interventions, then losses and gains can be summed to demonstrate a neutral net outcome for nature (Bull et al. , 2013a).  Normally, when seeking NNL, it is required that the impacts predicted to occur as a result of a given development project are mitigated through a sequential ‘mitigation hierarchy’ of preferred measures.  A widespread framing of the mitigation hierarchy is ‘avoid, minimize, remediate, offset’ i. e.  predicted impacts are ﬁrst avoided or minimized wherever possible, then remediated immediately if they are only temporary, and ﬁnally, all residual predicted impacts are compensated for through biodiversity offsets (Gardner et al. , 2013.  Bull et al. , 2016).  The most controversial component of the mitigation hierarchy is biodiversity offsetting (Apostolopoulou and Adams, 2017.  Maron et al. , 2016).  Biodiversity offsets (henceforth, offsets) involve the implementation of conservation actions, such as habitat creation, that provide quantiﬁed biodiversity gains which would not have been achieved otherwise – thereby fully and demonstrably compensating for any unavoidable impacts from the associated development project.  Out of this simple premise, a large body of theoretical literature has emerged, detailing what form and magnitude the biodiversity gains that constitute offsets must take in order to ensure that the overarching NNL objective is met (Calvet et al. , 2015).  Widely held theoretical principles of good practice for biodiversity offsetting include that.  offset gains should be realised in close proximity to development losses (Pilgrim et al. , 2013).  gains must be larger than losses by some factor, to account for restoration uncertainties and other considerations (Moilanen et al. , 2009).  and, NNL should be explicitly calculated against some counterfactual capturing background biodiversity trends (Bull et al. , 2014).  The ﬁrst of these principles, the proximity requirement, can also be interpreted as meaning ‘functional’ proximity e. g.  a wetland offset being implemented in the same watershed as the development for which it compensates.  In the case of either spatial or functional proximity, the assumed preference for proximity means that offsets in different countries to the associated development have not widely been countenanced.  Environmental policies involving trade-offs can be difﬁcult to implement if local stakeholders do not view the trades favourably (Daw et al. , 2015).  Furthermore, in addition to technical requirements, the amount of ecological compensation necessary to achieve NNL is thought to require consideration as to what local stakeholders are willing to accept (Bull et al. , 2017).  For both reasons, the potential perception of biodiversity offsets held by laypeople should be an important consideration in NNL policy development.  Survey methods have previously been employed to understand perspectives on the effectiveness of offsetting as a process from those involved in NNL trades (Coggan et al. , 2013.  Vaissière and Levrel, 2015), and to understand perceived offset needs from other local stakeholders (Burton et al. , 2016.  Kermagoret et al. , 2016).  However, to date, there has been no study that determines whether, or to what extent, basic principles underlying NNL are generally intuitive to those with little prior experience of the concept.  Consequently, in this article, we focus upon stated choices for biodiversity compensation requirements from survey participants who are not NNL experts, and compare this with the logic underlying offsetting.  In particular, we are interested in the application of NNL in a trans-boundary conservation context, how much compensation participants consider necessary, and how this amount is inﬂuenced by different background biodiversity trends.  1. 2.  Trans-boundary Biodiversity Conservation.  Nature conservation is always challenging across socio-political boundaries, and interventions must be designed in such a way as to acknowledge differences in societal values (Dallimer and Strange, 2015).  It has been shown that people are generally willing to contribute more towards conservation in their own country than elsewhere (Dallimer et al. , 2015).  That ﬁnding has been replicated for NNL by Burton et al.  (2016), who show that offsets implemented to compensate for development impacts are more acceptable the closer they are to the development site, and can become unacceptable if proposed for implementation in another country.  We should therefore not be surprised if the public is less likely to accept NNL policies when the outcome of the policy is trans-boundary conservation interventions, and indeed, such an idea is controversial (Žydelis et al. , 2009).  But it has been shown that trans-boundary offsets might be necessary to achieve NNL in the case of some highly mobile biodiversity conservation targets e. g.  migratory species (Wilcox and Donlan, 2007.  Bull et al. , 2013b).  Therefore, it is important to clarify whether there are any conditions under which trans-boundary offsets might be considered acceptable, and by1. 3.  Multipliers and Counterfactuals.  A fundamental component of NNL is deciding to what extent ‘multipliers’ are necessary.  Multipliers are factors applied to predicted losses, to determine how large gains must be in order to ensure that NNL is achieved once restoration uncertainties and other technical considerations are accounted for (Pilgrim and Ekstrom, 2014).  Beyond such standard uses, multipliers could feasibly be employed to incorporate social considerations such as human risk aversion into NNL schemes (Bull et al. , 2017).  However, there has been no previous empirical study that surveys people's perceptions as to how large a multiplier they would instinctively deem reasonable.  Accounting purely for ecological considerations and time preferences, it is considered that achieving NNL always requires multipliers to be greater than or equal to unity, and often in the tens or hundreds (Moilanen et al. , 2009.  Overton et al. , 2012.  Laitila et al. , 2014).  Achieving NNL also requires an understanding of the background biodiversity trends in the policy region, as these then act as one counterfactual against which any losses and gains can be evaluated.  That is to say, biodiversity gains realised under NNL policy do not necessarily have to be absolute gains, but rather, gains against what would have happened in the absence of the NNL policy (Ferraro and Pattanayak, 2006.  Bull et al. , 2014.  Maron et al. , 2015).  So, if the background biodiversity trend providing the counterfactual for evaluation is one of decline, then a smaller absolute conservation gain can be considered to have achieved NNL than the case in which the trend is for stability (so-called ‘averted losses’.  Maron et al. , 2015).  Counterfactuals are not a straightforward concept, and no one has yet explored how the layperson might vary their stated compensation requirements under different counterfactual biodiversity change scenarios.  1. 4.  Non-expert Perception of No Net Loss.  Here, we use the results of an international study conducted across three countries (Denmark, Ghana, and Spain) to explore perceptions of what might constitute NNL on the part of certain ‘non-experts’.  We consider an NNL expert to be someone who has either published peerreviewed literature on NNL, or who has speciﬁcally worked on delivering NNL projects on the ground.  Anyone else, including experienced or even highly educated ecologists, is unlikely to have much technical understanding of delivering NNL.  Since our survey respondent group was almost entirely undergraduate students (see Sections 2, 3), we assume likely to have included very few, if any, NNL experts.  Consequently, we did not expect participants to consider compensation requirements for NNL on technical grounds.  Rather, the survey was employed to elicit stated choices as to the amount of ecological gains considered appropriate to compensate for development impacts (from which we could calculate the implicit multiplier), where these should be implemented, and the inﬂuence upon offset requirements of different background habitat trends (i. e.  counterfactual scenarios).  In the survey itself, we made no mention of the phrases “biodiversity offset” or “no net loss” to avoid priming participants, as such phrases can be highly loaded (e. g.  Apostolopoulou and Adams, 2017.  Bull et al. , 2016).  The survey left open to participants the possibility of proposing offsets in different countries, allowing us to consider whether and when trans-boundary offsets might be deemed reasonable.  The main scenarios investigated were those in which losses and gains were achieved in terms of forest cover (an important habitat for nature conservation activities).  We also included a scenario in which forest creation could provide incidental beneﬁts for a migratory bird species, allowing us to consider how conservation preferences might change if offset gains explicitly beneﬁtted more than one component of biodiversity and therefore had greater conservation value.  Finally, we link the elicited conservation offsets to preferences of risk, trust, collaboration, and other beliefs of the participants about the other countries named in the survey.  Given the context discussed throughout Section 1, our hypotheses are that.  1.  Participants will on average overwhelmingly prefer compensation (in the form of absolute area of proposed forest creation) in their own country, rather than abroad.  2.  Proposed multipliers, constituting an average gain. loss ratio in forest area, will be equal to or greater than unity, for losses and gains within the participant's own country.  3.  Participants will require equal or less compensation if the background trend in forest habitat cover trend is one of decline, than if it is stable or increasing.  and, 4.  Participants will require less compensation if forest creation provide incidental beneﬁts for other components of biodiversity.  <Middle> Materials and Methods.  2. 1.  Survey Methodology.  We designed and implemented a survey simultaneously at universities in Denmark, Spain and Ghana, as part of a broader series of economic experiments conducted in these countries from April to May 2016.  The inclusion of these three countries in our study was arbitrary and based upon the availability of experimental resources, rather than due to the countries having any speciﬁc type of NNL policy framework.  Although Denmark and Spain are covered by European Directives featuring an NNL objective, none of the three countries are considered to have well-established offset policies (Maron et al. , 2016).  This was beneﬁcial from our perspective.  our focus here was not upon the ﬁner details of NNL legislation, but upon general perceptions of what constitutes sufﬁcient biodiversity compensation from respondents with little prior experience of NNL policy.  Survey participants in Denmark and Spain were recruited at random using the ORSEE software (a web-based online recruitment system, containing a database of students voluntarily willing to participate in economic experiments and surveys.  Greiner, 2015) whilst voluntary participants in Ghana were recruited using ﬂyers and in-class advertisements.  All survey participants signed a consent form (Appendix A).  These experiments were conducted at the University of Copenhagen (Denmark), Pompeu Fabra University (Spain), and the University of Ghana (Ghana).  All participants were undergraduate students from these universities, and they were all national citizens of the country for which they were answering the survey.  Whilst the use of student respondents in economic experiments could feasibly deliver ﬁndings that generally representative (Exadaktylos et al. , 2013), we consider our results here to relate to students as a subset of NNL non-experts only.  The survey questionnaire was originally written in English, translated to Danish and Spanish and then retranslated back to English, as is standard (Buchan et al. , 2002).  Anonymity for each survey participant is ensured.  names were not collected, and participants were known only by Subject ID numbers.  When answering the survey, participants in Denmark and Spain were divided by a partition, whilst participants in Ghana sat with two seats between them.  Individuals conducting the surveys were nationals of the country they were assigned to, but all were trained in survey protocols together in Denmark.  In total, we conducted 20 survey sessions in each country.  Each survey session had 12 participants each.  The relevant components of the survey forms were not completed by 7 participants in Denmark, by 5 participants in Spain, and by 17 participants in Ghana.  One limitation of our method was that a speciﬁc opt-out question was not included, although those who did not complete our survey were assumed to have opted out.  This left a total of 691 (of a maximum possible 720) survey participants who did not opt out.  233 from Denmark, 235 from Spain and 223 fromThe survey was composed of demographic questions (Appendix A), questions on beliefs and perceptions (Appendix B), and a stated preference survey to elicit respondent preferences for biodiversity offset requirements given a development scenario under NNL policy (Appendix C).  In the questionnaire for beliefs and perceptions, we solicited participant beliefs regarding themselves, individuals with nationalities similar to theirs, and individuals with nationalities different to theirs.  We measured risk, like/dislike, trust, cooperativeness, care for nature, desire for environmental conservation, desire to protect the habitat of migratory birds, wealth, and whether others care for the participant and the participant's country.  All metrics were measured on a Likert Scale, from 1 to 10 for individual risk preferences and from 1 to 4 for everything else.  2. 2.  Scenarios.  We outlined a hypothetical scenario in which a road development was planned, involving the clearance of 100 ha of existing forest in the participants' own country.  We then asked what area of biodiversity compensation (in this case, the creation of a new area of forest) participants would consider reasonable, as compensation for the impacts of the road.  There was no constraint upon in which of the three countries the compensatory forest could be planted, nor upon how large an area of compensation could be selected.  Whilst, as discussed, we avoided priming the participants with controversial phrases such as “biodiversity offset”, we did specify that developers were required to plant at least 100 ha of new forest, ensuring that the survey implied an overall NNL objective.  This same question was asked to each respondent for four different scenarios.  In the ﬁrst, forest habitat in all countries was considered stable in condition over time.  In the second scenario, forest cover was decreasing in the participant's own country, and stable or increasing in the other two countries.  The third scenario reﬂected the actual situation in the three countries with regards to current trends in forest cover (increasing in Denmark and Spain, decreasing in Ghana).  Finally, we asked participants to respond to the ﬁrst scenario again, but this time they were told that blackcap Sylvia atricapilla populations would also be impacted by the development, and beneﬁts to blackcaps would be larger (per hectare of new forest created) in Africa than in Europe.  Blackcaps were chosen for the study despite being of low conservation concern, because they met our criteria of being.  migratory birds.  present across all three countries.  and, dependent upon forest habitat.  The proposed scenario that the beneﬁts of conservation action for blackcaps would be larger in Africa than Europe was purely hypothetical, but participants were not informed that this was the case.  The four scenarios are summarized below.  Scenario 1.  forest cover stable in all three countries.  Scenario 2.  forest cover decreasing in the participant's country, but stable or increasing in the other two countries.  Scenario 3.  forest cover increasing in Denmark and Spain, decreasing in Ghana.  Scenario 4.  as for Scenario 1.  In addition, blackcap populations would beneﬁt more from forest creation in Ghana than in Spain and Denmark.  Scenario 1 was used to test Hypotheses 1 and 2, Scenarios 2 and 3 were used to test Hypothesis 3, and Scenario 4 was used to test Hypothesis 4 (see Section 1).  2. 3.  Test Statistics.  We analysed all data using two standard data analysis techniques.  Student's t-test and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression (note that throughout Section 2. 3, we draw from Wooldridge, 2002.  Moffat, 2016).  The Student's t-test is a commonly used technique for testing a hypothesis concerning the difference between sample means.  It determines a probability that two populations are the same with respect to the variable being tested.  In our case, ‘populations’ are countries of origin, and the test variable is the amount of reforestation an individual required to offset forest loss.  Our data satisfy the assumptions underlying the Student's t-test.  (1) the scale is continuous and ordinal.  (2) data were collected from a randomly selected portion of the student population in the surveyed universities.  (3) by the central limit theorem and given that the sample sizes in each our three countries are N50, our means approach a normal distribution regardless of the distribution of the population.  and, (4) our dataset is reasonably large, containing 200+ observations per population.  We ran the OLS regression in order to identify the magnitude and direction of the above effect, and determine whether this remained consistent when controlling for possibly confounding socio-demographic factors.  An OLS regression describes the linear relationship between the dependent variable (hectares of forest) and the independent variable (country of origin).  Whilst the only assumption needed to obtain an estimator in OLS regression is (1) for explanatory variables not to be perfectly collinear with one another, there are four other assumptions that make the OLS estimator the best linear unbiased estimator.  (2) linearity in parameters.  (3) random sampling of observations.  (4) conditional mean is zero.  and, (5) homoskedasticity.  Our data satisfy all 5 assumptions.  None of our dependent variables are perfectly collinear with our independent variables.  If they were, our coefﬁcient would be 1 and we would not have been able to derive standard errors and pvalues.  Since we thought it likely that our errors were heteroskedastic given the sample size, we used robust standard errors.  3.  Results.  All survey participants were at least 18 years of age at the time of the survey.  Average participant age in Denmark was 24 (max = 53).  average participant age in Spain was 21 (max = 56).
