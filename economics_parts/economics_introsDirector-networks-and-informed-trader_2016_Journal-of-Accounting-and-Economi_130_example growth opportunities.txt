Corporate directors have access to material non-public information, which makes them a potential information source for
professional traders.  Directors are, of course, required to keep sensitive material private: Delaware law recognizes a director's
duty of conﬁdentiality, and corporations have comprehensive policies in place to prevent leaks.  Investors, too, face regulatory
scrutiny and reputational costs if they use inside information in traceable manners, and these safeguards seem to be effective
in some institutional settings (Grifﬁn Name, 2012).  However, sensitive information can travel through education networks from
senior corporate ofﬁcers to mutual fund managers and sell-side analysts (Cohen Name, 2008, 2010).  This raises an important
question: to what extent do director networks transmit information that sophisticated traders are able to exploit. 
We investigate whether the breadth of directors' professional connections systematically affects the likelihood of
information leakage to sophisticated traders.  Well-connected directors interact with scores of people, and unguarded
conversations can easily reveal sensitive facts.  In addition, Larcker Name (2013) show that ﬁrms beneﬁt from more connected
boards because board connections are a conduit of information exchange.  Yet an important competitive advantage of
connected directors stems from their ability to provide insights that would otherwise be inaccessible to less connected
colleagues.  Fulﬁlling this role might require some deliberate sharing of sensitive material.  Sophisticated traders, who gather,
analyze and interpret data from multiple sources, have a comparative advantage when piecing together information about
ﬁrms with highly connected directors.  We therefore study possible information transmission from corporate directors to
sophisticated traders by examining the relation between board connectedness and the informativeness of trades made by
short sellers, option traders, and institutional investors. 
Our results indicate that these investor groups are indeed more informed when trading stocks of companies with more
connected boards.  We measure informed trading as the monthly level of short interest, the ratio of monthly option volume
to stock volume, and weekly order imbalances of institutional traders.  From BoardEx, we obtain the number of ﬁrst-degree
connections for each director, which includes links through educational institutions attended, current and previous employers,
military service and civic institutions.  To ensure that our measure of board connectedness is not driven by factors that
have been documented to affect the ﬁrm's information environment, we ﬁrst aggregate the connections of all board members
and then orthogonalize them with respect to ﬁrm size, board size, ﬁrm age, the number of analysts and institutional
ownership.  We examine portfolios sorted by board connectedness and each of the three measures of informed trading
and ﬁnd that the annualized return difference between the highest and lowest quintile of informed trading in highly connected boards is signiﬁcantly more pronounced compared to the same return difference in ﬁrms with less connected boards. 
The economic magnitude ranges from 4% for option volume and 5. 4% for short interest, to 7. 2% for institutional order
imbalance. 
Next, we examine whether the trades of sophisticated investors predict changes in ﬁrm fundamentals.  Our results indicate
that a higher fraction of negative earnings news is embedded in prices of highly connected ﬁrms ahead of the announcement,
and that sophisticated traders better anticipate earning surprises in ﬁrms with highly connected boards.  Indeed, their trades
predict ﬁrm-speciﬁc news content more broadly, as our analysis of Thompson Reuters' public news data shows.  Changes in
board connectedness are also positively associated with changes in measures of adverse selection costs, such as the probability
of informed trading (PIN), bid–ask spreads and the price impact measure of Amihud (2002).  In a series of robustness checks
we establish that neither family ownership, corporate governance quality, nor asset tangibility, drive our ﬁndings. 
Our study contributes to several strands of the literature.  First, we add novel insights to recent studies examining the
role of director networks in ﬁnancial markets.  Among directors these networks contribute to higher ﬁrm performance
(Larcker Name, 2013), the dissemination of CEO compensation practices (Wong Name, 2015), stock option backdating (Bizjak
Name, 2009), and earnings management (Chiu Name, 2012).  Board members and their social networks inﬂuence which
companies become targets in change-of-control transactions (Stuart and Yim, 2010).  Directors of Finnish ﬁrms earn sizable
abnormal returns by trading stocks where they have information advantages through their board connections (Berkman Name, 2014).  We build on these insights by documenting that board connections in general affect the external corporate
information environment, increase the potential for informed trading, and facilitate the dissemination of information into
stock prices.  While prior research suggests that analysts, media outlets and managers have incentives to convey positive
news (McNichols and O'Brien, 1997; Kothari Name, 2009), we show that negative news, in particular, ﬂows through director
networks. 
Second, we contribute to research into the information sources of sophisticated traders.  Short sellers predict the outcome
of earnings surprises (Christophe Name, 2004), detect ﬁnancial misconduct (Karpoff and Lou, 2010), and uncover hidden bad
news in high levels of accruals (Hirshleifer Name, 2011).  Short sellers excel in processing publicly available news (Engelberg
Name, 2012) and receive tips ahead of analyst downgrades (Christophe Name, 2010).  Option trades (Pan and Poteshman, 2006;
Johnson and So, 2012) and institutional trades (Grifﬁn Name, 2003; Campbell Name, 2009; Puckett and Yan, 2011) also predict
future stock prices.  Our ﬁndings suggest that more connected directors contribute, directly or inadvertently, to the information set of short sellers, option traders, and institutional investors.  More generally, we advance an emergent literature
that examines how a ﬁrm's organizational structure affects its information environment.  Anderson Name (2012) report that
family ownership increases informed trading.  We complement their ﬁndings by directly linking the governance structure of
the ﬁrm to sophisticated trading in the ﬁrm's stock. 
<Middle> Identiﬁcation strategy and hypotheses development. 
How does material non-public information ﬂow from corporate insiders to sophisticated investors.  What organizational
characteristics restrain or exacerbate the magnitude of information transmission.  How does this affect trading and security
prices.  These questions, while essential to understand, are difﬁcult to answer.  Insiders can be found on every level of the
corporate hierarchy, the sophistication of traders is not readily apparent, both groups have incentives to keep their conversations about privileged information secret, and traders frequently disguise trades that could trigger regulatory attention. 
In light of these challenges, we develop a novel identiﬁcation strategy that focuses on the possible information transmission
between two important groups of people: we investigate whether patterns in trading behavior and securities prices suggest
that privileged information ﬂows from corporate directors to sophisticated traders. 
By focusing on the board of directors, we study a group of clearly identiﬁable corporate insiders with privileged information about their ﬁrms.  Unfettered access to material, non-public information is necessary to monitor and advise management, the social networks of directors are observable, and recent studies suggest that these networks are important
conduits of information exchange.  We argue that sophisticated traders can obtain privileged information from directors and
trade proﬁtably on that information before it becomes available to the broader market.  If information is channeled towards
sophisticated traders, their proﬁtability will be high.  In contrast, if connected directors disseminate sensitive information
broadly, prices will quickly incorporate it, leaving smaller proﬁt opportunities for sophisticated traders.  As possible transmission channels we consider inadvertent information leakage, deliberate sharing of sensitive information, and “mosaic”
information gathering.  We discuss each channel in turn. 
The risk of inadvertent information leakage increases with the size of the network of people who are privy to material
non-public information. 1 Steele (1989) formalizes this idea, and models the likelihood of disclosing a secret as proportional
to the square of the number of people who know the secret.  More connections increase the difﬁculty of guarding against the
unintended disclosure of private information.  We therefore expect that inadvertent information leakage will be more
pronounced for companies with more connected boards. 
Directors also face incentives to share sensitive information deliberately.  After all, an important competitive advantage of
broadly connected directors stems from their ability to obtain and share insights that would otherwise be inaccessible to
less connected colleagues.  Molm (2003) suggests that reciprocal information sharing increases the status and inﬂuence of an
individual within a network.  Fisman Name (2012) remark that “board membership more broadly creates a context for a kind
of reciprocal attraction and friendship among a fraternity of individuals. ” While SEC enforcement actions allege that
directors have deliberately provided information to traders,2 our study does not assess the legality of directors' actions. 
Reciprocal sharing of sensitive material by connected directors does not necessarily harm shareholders; the beneﬁts of
connectedness may outweigh the costs.  Incentives related to reciprocal sharing simply suggest that highly connected
directors are more likely to divulge some sensitive information. 
More connected directors may increase the amount of publicly available information in ways that favor “mosaic”
information gathering by sophisticated investors.  Jarrell (2011) argues: “Securities analysts and investment managers legally
gather, analyze and interpret large quantities of information from multiple sources.  From this information, investment
recommendations and decisions are routinely made.  Not until the ‘bits and pieces’ of stray information are compiled
together into a ‘complete picture of the company’ does it sometimes reveal material, non-public information.  It is my
understanding that under the ‘mosaic theory,’ analysts and investment managers are free to act on this compilation of
information without risking liability under the insider trading laws. ”3 Due to their extensive networks, more connected
directors provide better access to these “bits and pieces”: they are members of clubs, societies, and other ﬁrms, they are
often invited to give speeches, and frequently interpret publicly available information about their ﬁrm.  While most investors
lack the resources to piece together this kind of public information, sophisticated traders physically track directors,4 comb
through public records of their large consumer and asset purchases and attend their invited speaking events.  Some directors
are even spied on. 5 The more connected the members of corporate boards are, the greater the amount of difﬁcult-to-process
information that sophisticated trades might be able to access. 
While inadvertent information leakage, deliberate tipping, and “mosaic” information gathering are three possible
channels of information transmission, it is not clear that companies with more connected directors are indeed associated
with more informed trading: Federal regulations prohibit selective disclosure, Delaware law recognizes the duty of conﬁdentiality as part of a director's duty of loyalty, and corporate lawyers have developed comprehensive conﬁdentiality
policies to prevent leaks.  In addition, Grifﬁn Name (2012) argue that institutional investors are reluctant to use inside
information in traceable manners.  Our null hypothesis is that there is no systematic link between board connectedness and
informed trading. 
Banerjee and Eckard (2001) , however, doubt that insider trading regulations effectively limit informed trading.  Many
studies document informed trading among short sellers, option traders and institutional investors, and more connected
boards might increase the information ﬂow to these sophisticated traders.  The information channels that we identify are not
the only possible ones, they are not necessarily illegal or mutually exclusive, and we are not assessing their relative
importance.  Our alternative hypothesis simply states that sophisticated investors' trades are more informed when they trade
shares in ﬁrms with more connected boards. 
3.  Sample selection, variables and descriptive statistics. 
3. 1.  Sample selection. 
The BoardEx database tracks connections of corporate directors and executives from 2002 onward.  Since we rely on
BoardEx to quantify board connections, our sample period begins in January 2002 and ends in December 2011.  Stock prices,
trading volume and shares outstanding are from CRSP, book-to-market ratios, leverage, ROA, R&D, industry segments, and
other accounting variables are from COMPUSTAT, options data come from Ivy OptionMetrics, institutional ownership and
insider trading data are provided by Thomson Financial, and analysts' forecasts by I/B/E/S.  We limit our analysis to common
stocks (share code 10 or 11) of non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms traded on AMEX, NYSE, or NASDAQ and require stocks to have at least 12
months of past return data, at least 10 days per month with available trades and return data, a month-end stock price above
one dollar, and sufﬁcient data from COMPUSTAT to compute accounting ratios as of December of the previous year. 
3. 2.  Measures of informed trading
In our analysis we use three measures of informed trading.  Our ﬁrst measure is the monthly level of Short Interest,
deﬁned as current shares sold short divided by total shares outstanding.  Monthly short interest data are available for the
entire sample period for which we have board characteristics and options data.  Several studies, including Asquith Name
(2005), Desai Name (2006) and Karpoff and Lou (2010) use monthly short interest as a measure of short selling activity, and
document that short interest contains negative information about stock prices and future ﬁrm fundamentals.  Boehmer Name
(2010) argue that absence of short interest can be viewed as a signal of good news.  Thus, short interest can signal bad news
by its presence, or good news by its absence. 
Our second measure of informed trading is the ratio of total monthly put and call trading volume to stock trading
volume, or Option/Stock volume.  Pan and Poteshman (2006) provide evidence of informed trading by using proprietary
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) option market data.  More recently, Johnson and So (2012) report that Option/Stock
volume contains negative information about future stock prices. 
Our third measure of informed trading is institutional trading order imbalances.  Grifﬁn Name (2003), Campbell Name
(2009), and Puckett and Yan (2011) document that institutions are informed traders whose trades predict stock returns.  To
measure institutional trading, we use the weekly trading order imbalance of institutional traders in each stock.  The trading
order imbalance, Institutional OIB, measures whether the observed weekly trading volume is dominated by institutional
buying or selling.  We obtain transaction level data on institutional trading from Ancerno Ltd.  for the period from 2002 to
2011.  For each stock, we calculate order imbalance as buyer minus seller initiated institutional trading over a week, normalized by total institutional trading activity measured as the total number of shares traded.  A positive institutional trading
order imbalance indicates that institutions are net buyers, and a positive relation between weekly order imbalance and
future returns suggests that institutions are informed traders.  We expect this relation between Institutional OIB and subsequent returns to be more pronounced for ﬁrms with more connected boards.  Following Johnson and So (2012), we
transform all informed trading measures into decile ranks and use the decile ranks of these variables in multivariate
regressions that feature the particular informed trading measure. 
3. 3.  Measuring board connectedness
We obtain connections for each director from the BoardEx database and aggregate them at the board level.  This
straightforward measure of board connections merely enumerates the number of ﬁrst-degree links for all directors on the
board.  This includes connections through educational institutions attended, current and previous employers, military service as well as civic institutions like non-proﬁt boards. 6 Yet this simple aggregation suffers from two obvious drawbacks. 
First, by construction, this aggregation increases mechanically with the number of directors, leading to a Spearman rank
correlation of more than 0. 6 between board size and aggregate connections. 
Second, several factors have been identiﬁed in the literature to affect the ﬁrm's information environment and the
potential returns from informed trading, which are also correlated with aggregate director connections.  For example, ﬁrm
size affects the quality and quantity of information that can be exploited by informed traders (Hong Name, 2000), but
directors of larger ﬁrms tend to be more connected within the BoardEx universe.  Similarly, Zhang (2006) argues that ﬁrm
age captures differences of opinion related to future events, but directors of older ﬁrms have more aggregate connections. 
Firms with more analyst following are also likely to have more connected directors, but the amount of analyst coverage
directly affects the information available about the ﬁrm (Hong Name, 2000).  Finally, D'Avolio (2002) provides evidence that
institutional ownership measures shorting costs because it affects the supply of lendable shares, and Cohen Name (2007)
document that the ability to exploit information depends on the ability to access loaned shares.  At the same time, directors
of ﬁrms with more institutional investors also tend to have more connections. 
To ensure that our measure of board connectedness is not driven by any of these factors, we regress the natural logarithm
of aggregate board connections on the natural logarithms of ﬁrm size, board size, ﬁrm age, number of analysts, and on
institutional ownership, and use the residual values from these year-end cross-sectional regressions, which we term Connectedness, to categorize ﬁrms in our sample. 
3. 4.  Additional control variables
Beyond orthogonalizing our Connectedness measure with respect to factors that have been shown to jointly affect
opportunities for informed traders and aggregate director connections, we account in our multivariate regressions for
characteristics of the ﬁrm's information and contracting environment that might affect board characteristics or the measures of informed trading.  For example, growth opportunities (book-to-market) are an important proxy of the corporate
information environment that has been shown to affect a ﬁrm's governance choices.  However, ﬁrms that are growing more
slowly are less opaque, have less information uncertainty, and hence, lower opportunities for informed trading (Hong Name,
2000; Zhang, 2006).
