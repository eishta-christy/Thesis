 1.  Introduction  The information contained in earnings announcements plays an important role in the determination of stock prices.   Despite its importance, numerous studies show that stock prices do not immediately and fully incorporate all of the information in earnings announcements and that various accounting-based measures and ﬁnancial statement components have  the ability to predict future stock prices.  Among the reasons offered for these apparent ineﬃciencies are limits on investor  attention, which lead investors to focus on subsets of information, and investors’ inability to fully understand the complexities of the information contained in earnings reports (e. g. , Bartov et al. , 20 0 0 .  Hirshleifer et al. , 2011 .  Doyle et al. , 2006 .   DellaVigna and Pollet, 2009 .  You and Zhang, 2009 ).   Prior research has shown that bond prices, like stock prices, react to earnings news.   This literature, though, does not examine whether corporate bonds incorporate earnings news more eﬃciently than stocks.  The reason why they might is that  the bond market is more heavily dominated by sophisticated investors than is the stock market ( Bessembinder et al. , 2009 .   De Franco et al. , 2009 .  Ronen and Zhou, 2013 ).  These investors have greater resources at their disposal to analyze earnings  reports and are arguably less constrained than are individual investors by either limited attention or diﬃculties in interpreting the information in earnings announcements.  This is supported by Bartov et al.  (20 0 0) and Doyle et al.  (2006) who  show that greater sophisticated investor presence enhances the ability of share prices to quickly incorporate the information  contained in earnings announcements and to mitigate the post-earnings announcement drift.  Consistent with this, Campbell  et al.  (2009) show that institutions trade aggressively to exploit the post-earnings announcement drift.  These results suggest  that if sophisticated investors are more dominant in the bond market than in the stock market, then earnings news would  be incorporated more quickly into bond prices than into stock prices.  Consequently, the bond price reaction to earnings  announcements would, similar to a number of accounting-based measures, have predictive power for future stock returns.   Counterbalancing this is the fact that bonds are typically less liquid and less actively traded than stocks.   Lower levels of liquidity could lead to an increase in the cost of trading and a reduction in the speed with which sophisticated bond  investors trade to their new positions, reducing the relative eﬃciency of the bond market.  For the equity market, the link  between liquidity and the speed of price adjustment has been well documented.  For example, Chordia et al.  (2008) show  that return predictability diminishes in the presence of greater liquidity, while Bhushan (1994) ﬁnds liquidity to be inversely  related to the magnitude of the post-earnings announcement drift.  Evidence for a link between liquidity and bond market  eﬃciency is reported in Ronen and Zhou (2013) .  If lower levels of liquidity in the bond market impede the eﬃciency of  bonds prices, then the ability of bond returns to predict post-announcement stock returns may be restricted to ﬁrms whose  bonds are more liquid.  Testing whether, and under what circumstances, the bond price reaction to earnings announcements  has predictive power for future stock returns is the central focus of this study.   For my tests I use the TRACE database to calculate raw and abnormal bond returns around 19,518 quarterly earnings  announcements of 770 unique ﬁrms between the years 2005 and 2014.  As a ﬁrst step in my analysis I partition ﬁrms each  quarter into deciles according to the bond price reaction to that quarter’s earnings announcement.  For a ﬁrm with multiple  bonds, the ﬁrm’s bond price reaction is the value-weighted average of the ﬁrm’s individual bond returns.  For each decile I  then calculate the average buy-and-hold abnormal stock return over the 60 days subsequent to an earnings announcement.   For the decile with the highest raw (abnormal) bond price reactions, the average buy-and-hold abnormal stock return is 1. 07  (1. 11) percent.  This compares to −1. 70 (−0. 96) percent for the lowest decile.  The difference of 2. 77 (2. 08) percentage points  is signiﬁcantly positive and provides preliminary evidence that the reaction of a ﬁrm’s bonds to its earnings announcements  has predictive power for the ﬁrm’s post-announcement stock return.   Next,  I  test  whether  bonds’  predictive  ability  is  stronger  in  bonds  of  non-investment  grade  ﬁrms  than  for  those  of  investment-grade ﬁrms.  I conjecture that this will be true because bonds of investment-grade ﬁrms are in little danger  of default, and so earnings news is unlikely to have much of an effect on their prices.  In contrast, the prices of bonds of  non-investment grade ﬁrms, which are riskier, should be more sensitive to earnings information.  This is consistent with  existing empirical evidence that the price sensitivity to ﬁrm-speciﬁc information is greater for non-investment grade bonds  than for investment-grade bonds (e. g. , Easton et al. , 2009 and Defond and Zhang, 2014 ).   Applying  the  same  univariate  analysis  above,  I  ﬁnd  that  the  difference  between  the  average  buy-and-hold  abnormal  stock returns of the highest and lowest raw (abnormal) bond return deciles of the bonds of non-investment grade ﬁrms is  a positive and signiﬁcant 7. 49 (6. 35) percentage points, while it is insigniﬁcant for the subsample of bonds of investmentgrade ﬁrms.  These results suggest that the ability of bond returns to predict stock prices comes exclusively from the bonds  of non-investment ﬁrms, consistent with my conjecture.  Moreover, these results also show that, within non-investment  grade ﬁrms, the predictive ability is driven mostly by bonds that have a negative price reaction to earnings announcements,  consistent with bond investors being more sensitive to downside risk.   I next test whether the ability of the bond price reaction to earnings announcements is incremental to that of unexpected  earnings and accruals.  To do so, I ﬁrst sort my sample into quintiles according to standardized unexpected earnings ( SUE)  every quarter.  Within each of these quintiles, I again sort into quintiles based on the bond price reaction.  I ﬁnd that for  the lowest SUE quintile the difference between the 60-day average buy-and-hold abnormal stock return of the highest and  lowest quintile of the raw (abnormal) bond price reaction is a signiﬁcant 2. 95 (2. 55) percentage points.  The difference is  a signiﬁcant 2. 64 (2. 01) percentage points for the highest SUE quintile.  These results provide evidence that the predictive  ability of the bond price reaction to earnings announcements for future stock prices is incremental to that of unexpected  earnings.   Separately analyzing the investment-grade and non-investment grade ﬁrm subsamples shows that bonds’ incremental  predictive ability over unexpected earnings is driven by the subsample of non-investment grade ﬁrms, consistent with the  prior univariate results.  Focusing on the subsample of non-investment grade ﬁrms, we see that in the lowest SUE quintile,  where we would expect negative future stock returns, the mean return is actually positive when the bond price reaction to  the earnings announcement is high.  Similarly, in the highest SUE quintile, where we would expect future stock returns to  be positive, the mean stock return is actually negative when the bond price reaction to the earnings announcement is low.   In these cases, the bond price reaction, not the SUE , predicts the sign of the future stock return.   Next, I repeat the previous analysis using accruals, rather than unexpected earnings, as the initial partitioning variable.   I ﬁnd that for the lowest Accruals quintile the difference between the 60-day average buy-and-hold abnormal stock return  of the highest and lowest quintile of the raw (abnormal) bond price reaction is a signiﬁcant 3. 30 (3. 76) percentage points.   The difference is a signiﬁcant 2. 19 (1. 71) percentage points for the highest Accruals quintile.  These results provide evidence  that the bond price reaction to earnings announcements has predictive ability for future stock prices incremental to that of  accruals.   Separately analyzing the investment-grade and non-investment grade ﬁrm subsamples shows that bonds’ predictive ability is again driven by the subsample of non-investment grade ﬁrms.  Focusing on the non-investment grade ﬁrms subsample,  we see that in the lowest Accruals quintile, where we would expect positive future stock returns, the mean return is actually  negative when the bond price reaction to the earnings announcement is low.  In this case, the bond price reaction, not the  level of accruals, predicts the sign of the future stock return.   Having established that bond returns around earnings announcements can predict future stock returns, I next examine  factors that affect the strength of their predictive ability.  Since my results thus far show that the predictive ability of bond  returns is concentrated in the non-investment grade ﬁrms, the remainder of my analysis focuses on this subsample.  I turn  ﬁrst to an examination of the effect of institutional share ownership on bonds’ predictive ability for post-announcement  stock returns.  This analysis is motivated by the conjecture that the greater level of investor sophistication in the bond market relative to the stock market is a driving force behind bonds’ ability to predict future stock returns.  Consistent with this  conjecture, I ﬁnd that the ability of bond returns at the time of earnings announcements to predict post-announcement  stock returns is stronger in ﬁrms with lower institutional share ownership.  This result is consistent with that of Bartov et al.   (20 0 0) and Doyle et al.  (2006) who ﬁnd that the level of investor sophistication, as proxied for by institutional stock ownership, is negatively correlated with the magnitude of the post-announcement drift and with that of Collins et al.  (2003) who  ﬁnd that the returns on an accrual-based hedge portfolio are signiﬁcantly smaller for ﬁrms with more sophisticated investors.   Next, I turn to bond liquidity.  If a lack of liquidity in the bond market negatively impacts bond price eﬃciency, then  the ability of bond returns to predict post-announcement stock returns should be stronger for ﬁrms whose bonds are more  liquid.  To test this, I split the non-investment grade ﬁrms subsample into two subsamples based on bond liquidity.  For  the subsample of bonds with above-average liquidity I ﬁnd evidence that bond returns can predict post-announcement  stock returns.  there is no evidence of predictive ability in the subsample of bonds with below-average liquidity.  This is  consistent with Ronen and Zhou (2013) who ﬁnd that institutional bond trading following earnings announcements is highly  concentrated in the more liquid bonds.   My study makes three main contributions.  First, to the best of my knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst to provide evidence  that bond prices can predict post-announcement stock returns using information released in earnings announcements.  By  doing so, it complements existing research which shows that accounting information released in earnings announcements is  useful in predicting stock returns.  Second, and more importantly, my study provides a better understanding of when bond  prices have a greater ability to predict future stock returns.  Speciﬁcally, the paper shows that bonds’ predictive ability is  stronger in more liquid bonds.  Third, it is also the ﬁrst study to examine the impact that sophisticated stock traders have on  the relative eﬃciency of bond and stock prices, ﬁnding that the predictive ability of bonds is weaker for ﬁrms with greater  institutional shareholdings.  Previous work concentrated on investigating the relation between sophisticated traders in the  equity market and the eﬃciency of stock prices ( Bartov et al. , 20 0 0 .  Doyle et al. , 2006 ).   2.  Prior research on the lead-lag relation between stock and bond returns.  Several prior  studies  have examined  the  lead-lag relation  between stock  and  bond  returns.   An  early  study  by  Kwan  (1996) examines the correlation between weekly returns on individual stocks and the weekly yield changes of individual  bonds issued by the same ﬁrm, using a sample of 702 corporate bonds issued by 327 ﬁrms and a sample period of 1986– 1990.  He ﬁnds that lagged stock returns have explanatory power for current bond yield changes, but that lagged bond yield  changes are unrelated to current stock returns.  The study obtains bid yields from dealer quotes from Merrill Lynch.  These  quotes consist of weekly closing bid yields calculated from the bid prices of the last transaction quotes on each Friday  between January 1986 and December 1990 for a sample of corporate bonds quoted in Bloomberg.   Using a sample of about 1700 corporate bonds issued by approximately 430 ﬁrms and a sample period of 1973–1996,  Gebhardt et al.  (2005) show that stock returns over a six month period predict bond returns over the following six months.   For their study, they employ the Lehman Brothers Fixed Income database, where returns are calculated from month-end bid  prices of a single market maker, instead of from transaction prices.  They exclude non-investment grade bonds from their  sample because there is a lack of data on these bonds in the Lehman Brothers database before 1992.   Using the TRACE database, Downing et al.  (2009) analyze hourly and daily bond returns.  They focus on 30 0 0 bonds  issued by 439 ﬁrms and their associated stocks for a relatively short sample period beginning in October 2004 and ending  in December 2005.  They ﬁnd evidence that hourly stock returns lead bond returns for non-convertible junk and BBB-rated  bonds, and that stock returns lead bond returns for convertible bonds in all rating classes.   In  a  more  recent  study  that  also  uses  the  TRACE  database  and  covers  the  seven-year  period  from  2002  to  2008,  Bittlingmayer and Moser (2014) test whether bond prices lead stock prices.  Employing a sample of 1167 corporate bonds  issued by 442 ﬁrms, they ﬁnd evidence of bond prices leading stock prices (speciﬁcally, they ﬁnd that a decline of 10% in a  ﬁrm’s bond prices over a three month period is associated with a subsequent decline of 3% –6% in its stock price).  Further,  they show that this effect is stronger among lower rated bo nds and for bonds with greater trading volume.   None of these papers examine the relation between bond and stock prices at the time of earnings announcements, when  there is evidence of an increase in the level of bond trading and liquidity, especially among large investors (see Easton et al. ,  2009 .  Ronen and Zhou, 2013 , and Table 1 in the following section).  One paper that does focus on earnings announcements  is Hotchkiss and Ronen (2002) .  Employing a small sample of 34 high-yield bonds for 26 ﬁrms, and using prices recorded  on NASD’s Fixed Income Pricing System (FIPS) for the year 1995, they ﬁnd that corporate news are quickly incorporated  into both bond and stock prices.  However, their small sample size and short sample period make it diﬃcult to draw ﬁrm  conclusions from their ﬁndings.  Another paper that focuses on earnings announcements is Ronen and Zhou (2013) .  Using a  small sample of 66 ﬁrms, they identify factors that affect the speed with which bond and stock prices react to the news in  earnings during the minutes and hours (up to ten hours) after an earnings announcement.  While these papers do focus on  earnings announcements, they do not examine whether, and under what circumstances, the bond price reaction to earnings  announcements has predictive ability for future stock returns, which is the central question addressed in this paper.   <Middle> Sample selection, variable deﬁnitions, and descriptive statistics.  My initial sample consists of all quarterly earnings announcements contained in the CRSP-Compustat quarterly ﬁle for  ﬁrms  with  at  least  one  traded  bond  available in  the  TRACE  database  of  corporate  bond  trades.   I  use  the  Mergent  Fixed  Income Securities ( FISD ) database to obtain bond-speciﬁc information (including bond issue size, issue date, bond features,  bond ratings, coupon rate, and frequency of payment).  My sample spans the period January 2005 through December 2014.  I  choose January 2005 as the beginning of my sample period because this is when TRACE extended its coverage from a small  subset of bonds to 99% of the U. S.  corporate bond market.   I exclude observations for which the earnings announcement date recorded in I/B/E/S differs by more than ﬁve trading  days from the date recorded in Compustat .  If the dates differ by between one and ﬁve trading days, then the earlier of  the two is used as the earnings announcement date for my analysis (e. g. , DellaVigna and Pollet, 2009 ).  If the precise time  of the earnings announcement is also available and is after trading hours, I advance the earnings announcement date by  one trading day.  Additionally, I exclude bonds denominated in foreign currency, convertible bonds, rule 144A issues, bonds  5 To establish the link between the Mergent FISD  that are privately placed, and bonds with less than one year to maturity.   6  My ﬁnal sample consists of 19,518  and Compustat databases I use the linking table employed in Kerr and Ozel (2015) .   ﬁrm-quarter observations for 770 unique bond issuers.   Table  1  provides  descriptive  statistics  on  bond  and  stock  trading  activity  on  earnings  announcement  days  and  nonearnings announcement days.  Consistent with the notion that bond trading is relatively infrequent, the mean (median) number of bond trades per day is 6. 57 (1. 00) on earnings announcement days and 5. 59 (1. 00) on non-earnings announcement  days.  While the economic magnitude of the difference in trading activity between earnings announcement and non-earnings  announcement days is relatively small, it is still statistically signiﬁcant for both the mean and median.  The mean daily trading volume for bonds and stocks on earnings announcement days is relatively similar ($8. 18 million for bonds and $7. 28  million for stocks).  However, since bond trades reported in TRACE are capped at $5 ($1) million for investment-grade (noninvestment grade) bonds, mean daily trading volume for bonds is actually likely to be signiﬁcantly higher than for stocks.   The distribution of daily bond trading volume is more positively skewed (the median daily volume is $320,0 0 0) than the  distribution of daily stock trading volume (the median daily volume is $2. 5 million).  The mean (median) daily dollar trading volume relative to the total dollar amount of bonds outstanding is 23 basis points (2 basis points) around earnings  announcements compared to 19 basis points (0 basis points) on non-earnings announcement days.  The corresponding numbers for stocks are much higher.  mean (median) daily dollar trading volume relative to the total dollar amount of shares  outstanding is 115 basis points (30 basis points) around earnings announcement days and 80 basis points (20 basis points)  on non-announcement days.  Again, the bond numbers are downwardly biased due to the capping of bond trades in TRACE .   To compute daily bond returns, I ﬁrst calculate daily prices for each traded bond.  In order to do so, I eliminate cancelled,  corrected, and commission trades, as well as special trades.  The top and bottom 1% of the remaining clean trade prices  TRACE database.  Following the recommendation of Bessembinder et al.  (2009) , I also exclude all trades whose values are  8 Bessembinder et al.  (2009) provide  less than $10 0,0 0 0 and weight each of the remaining bond trades by its dollar value.   evidence that this method minimizes the noise in computed bond prices.  I denote by P ijt  the computed price of bond issue j of ﬁrm i on date t .   Using the Mergent FISD database, accrued interest for bond issue j of ﬁrm i as of date t, AI ijt  , is computed as follows, where C ij is the coupon payment for bond issue j of ﬁrm i, D ijt  is the number of days between date t and the date of  the prior coupon payment, and freq ij  is the number of coupon payments per year for bond issue j of ﬁrm i .  The dates of  the coupon payments are determined by coupon frequency and by the date of the ﬁrst coupon payment (both reported in  Mergent FISD ).  The bond return for date t is then given by, where C ijt  is the coupon payment (if any) on date t .  In the case of a ﬁrm that has more than one traded bond, I aggregate  the individual bond returns at the ﬁrm-level by taking a value-weighted average over all of the ﬁrm’s bonds.   Treating each bond as a separate observation would have biased the sample toward larger ﬁrms with many bonds.  More importantly, with  bond returns for the same ﬁrm being correlated, it would have led to biased test statistics (e. g. , Bessembinder et al. , 2009 ).   The bond price reaction to the announcement of ﬁrm i ’s earnings for quarter q, Bond iq −1,1), is then calculated as the value(  weighted average of the cumulative returns of the ﬁrm’s bonds over the three-day announcement window of the earnings  for quarter q (days  −1, 0, and 1, where day 0 denotes the date of the earnings announcement).   In addition to computing the raw bond price reaction, I estimate the abnormal bond price reaction to the announce−1,1).  Estimating  ment of ﬁrm i ’s earnings for quarter q over the three-day announcement window, denoted by AR_Bond iq abnormal bond returns presents some unique challenges that do not arise when estimating abnormal stock returns.
