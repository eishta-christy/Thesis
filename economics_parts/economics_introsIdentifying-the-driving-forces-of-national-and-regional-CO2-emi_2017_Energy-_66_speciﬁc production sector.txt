 1.  Introduction In recent years, climate change has aroused worldwide attention, and in-depth international discussions have been held to mitigate climate change.  Since 2007, China has surpassed the US to become the world's largest CO2 emitter, and thus becomes a focus of global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.  As one of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, China has always been promoting the implementation of the Convention and fulﬁlling its obligations.  Chinese government committed to reduce CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic production (GDP) by 40–45% towards 2020 at 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Conference and by 60–65% towards 2030 at 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference.  To achieve such challenging emission-reduction targets, China has attempted to adopt effective policy instruments, such as the deployment of renewable energy, the establishment of national carbon emission trading market.  China has experienced a signiﬁcant increase in CO2 emissions in the past decades (Liu et al. , 2015).  Large variations in the growth pattern of China's CO2 emissions at the regional level exist due to uneven distribution of initial resource endowment, economic scale, industry structure, development stage etc.  (Meng et al. , 2016).  CO2 emissions per capita and CO2 emissions per unit of GDP among China's 30 regions also vary sharply (Shan et al. , 2016).  Emission-reduction targets for each region should be set in considering the characteristics of socio-economic development (Wang et al. , 2016).  Therefore, it is necessary to explore the driving forces of the variations of national and regional CO2 emissions of China in order to set accurate emission-reduction targets and take effective measures from the perspective of national and regionalThis study explores the changes of national and regional CO2 emissions using temporal decomposition analysis model, and analyzes the differences of CO2 emissions between China's 30 regions and the national average using spatial decomposition analysis model.  In addition, this study evaluates the potential of emission-reduction of China's 30 regions.  The study did not only contribute to the energy saving and emission reduction of China's CO2 emissions but also provide some targeted suggestion for emission-reduction at regional and sectoralThe remainder of this study is organized as follows.  Section 2 reviews some existing literature.  Section 3 presents the models including temporal and spatial decomposition analysis models and data sources used in this study, and the overview of the national and regional CO2 emissions in China.  Section 4 depicts the decomposition results and evaluates the potential of emission-reduction in China's 30 regions.  Section 5 details further discussion of the deep-rooted reasons of key factors with larger effect on CO2 emissions and the future tendency of contribution of key factors.  Section 6 shows conclusion of the analysis, with summary and policy implications.  2.  Literature review.  Existing studies have been conducted to analyze the driving forces of the variations of national and regional CO2 emissions from the perspective of temporal and spatial level.  First, tracking changes of CO2 emissions and quantifying the driving forces of the changes over time have long been a focus area of researchers and policymakers.  Intensive studies have analyzed the CO2 emissions and the driving forces of the change of CO2 emissions at national (Wu et al. , 2005.  Jung et al. , 2012.  Cortés-Borda et al. , 2015.  Sumabat et al. , 2016.  van Ruijven et al. , 2016), regional (Liang et al. , 2007.  Geng et al. , 2013.  Wang et al. , 2017) and industrial level (Lin and Moubarak, 2013.  Xu and Lin, 2016a.  Talbi, 2017) overSecond, growing interest among researchers in comparing regions in terms of CO2 emissions emerges in recent years.  The comparison allows variations among countries or regions to be revealed, the contributing factors identiﬁed, and the scope for improvement better understood (Ang et al. , 2016).  Many studies on analyzing the differences in CO2 emissions among different countries (Sun, 2000a, 2000b.  Zhang and Ang, 2001.  Bataille et al. , 2007), regions (Feng et al. , 2009.  Su and Ang, 2016.  Xu and Lin, 2016b.  Wang et al. , 2016.  Xu et al. , 2016), and a speciﬁc sector among regions (Cui and Li, 2015.  Xu and Lin, 2016a, 2016c.  Long et al. , 2016) have also been conducted.  Besides, some studies are also involved in the spatio-temporal analysis on the differences in regional CO2 emissions in recent years (Huang and Meng, 2013.  Kim and Dall'erba, 2014.  Chen and Yang, 2015.  Ang et al. , 2016).  Existing literatures on the spatial analysis mainly focus on the differences in CO2 emissions among regions from the perspective of production or a speciﬁc production sector, and less literature are involved in householdDecomposition analysis is usually used to analyze the variations in energy usage and emissions (Ang, 2015).  The model can not only identify the main driving forces of the variations in an aggregation but also show the clearly quantitative results of to what extent the driving forces affect the variations (Su and Ang, 2012, 2015).
