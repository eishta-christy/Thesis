 Introduction Corporate directors have access to material non-public information, which makes them a potential information source for professional traders.  Directors are, of course, required to keep sensitive material private.  Delaware law recognizes a director's duty of conﬁdentiality, and corporations have comprehensive policies in place to prevent leaks.  Investors, too, face regulatory scrutiny and reputational costs if they use inside information in traceable manners, and these safeguards seem to be effective in some institutional settings (Grifﬁn et al. , 2012).  However, sensitive information can travel through education networks from senior corporate ofﬁcers to mutual fund managers and sell-side analysts (Cohen et al. , 2008, 2010).  This raises an important question.  to what extent do director networks transmit information that sophisticated traders are able to exploit.  We investigate whether the breadth of directors' professional connections systematically affects the likelihood of information leakage to sophisticated traders.  Well-connected directors interact with scores of people, and unguarded conversations can easily reveal sensitive facts.  In addition, Larcker et al.  (2013) show that ﬁrms beneﬁt from more connected boards because board connections are a conduit of information exchange.  Yet an important competitive advantage of connected directors stems from their ability to provide insights that would otherwise be inaccessible to less connected colleagues.  Fulﬁlling this role might require some deliberate sharing of sensitive material.  Sophisticated traders, who gather, analyze and interpret data from multiple sources, have a comparative advantage when piecing together information about ﬁrms with highly connected directors.  We therefore study possible information transmission from corporate directors to sophisticated traders by examining the relation between board connectedness and the informativeness of trades made by short sellers, option traders, and institutional investors.  Our results indicate that these investor groups are indeed more informed when trading stocks of companies with more connected boards.
