 1.  Introduction Aedes albopictus is the most invasive mosquito in the world (Medlock et al. , 2012).  It is an aggressive biter, active all-day long (Caglioti et al. , 2013) and feeds on humans and a variety of other vertebrate hosts.  It is relatively long lived and lays its desiccation resistant eggs in natural and artiﬁcial containers (Charrel et al. , 2007.  Pardigon, 2009).  Originally of Asian origin, it is now widely distributed across Europe, Africa, the Americas and the Paciﬁc (Tsetsarkin et al. , 2007).  It has recently colonized the islands of the Torres Strait (Ritchie et al. , 2006) where a limited control program costs over AU$1 M per annum (Muzari, 2015).  Ae.  albopictus is a vector of more than 20 arboviruses, is recognised as a secondary vector of dengue (Bonizzoni et al. , 2014.  Gratz, 2004.  Lambrechts et al. , 2010) and is the major vector of many recent chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreaks including the La Reunion epidemic (200,000 cases and 203 deaths.  Renault et al. , 2007).  In that instance, a single point mutation within the CHIKV genome led to a dramatic increase in transmissibility by this mosquito.  Aedes albopictus, at least in a laboratory context, is also capable of transmitting four major Australian endemic arboviruses.  Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), West Nile virus Kunjin strain (KUNV), Ross River virus (RRV), and Barmah Forest virus (BFV) (Nicholson et al. , 2014c).  Ae.  albopictus now has a signiﬁcant urban presence around the globe (Caglioti et al. , 2013.  Medlock et al. , 2012.  Powers and Logue, 2007.  Rezza et al. , 2007.  Tsetsarkin et al. , 2007.  Weaver and Barrett, 2004) and, in some settings, feeds almost exclusively on humans (Ponlawat and Harrington, 2005).  In those instances, Ae.  albopictus can transmit viruses with a human reservoir (i. e.  dengue, chikungunya) very efﬁciently (Weaver and Barrett, 2004).  Ae.  albopictus is likely to assume an increasingly prominent role in the transmission of human arboviruses in the future.  Australia is made vulnerable to that threat by a busy transport and travel network that links it to regions where both Ae albopictus and the diseases it transmits are endemic.  Exotic mosquito incursions at Australia's ports are on the increase (van den Hurk et al. , 2016) as are the number of imported cases of viruses such as dengue (Huang et al.
