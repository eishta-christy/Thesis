(M&A) demonstrates how variation in tax rates ( Scholes and Wolfson, 1990, Arulampalam Name, 2010 ) and in tax systems 
( Huizinga and Voget, 2009 ; Feld Name, 2016 ) impact the market for corporate control.  As a result, ﬁrms under a worldwide 
tax system are tax-disadvantaged acquirers .  Furthering this line of inquiry, we posit that ﬁrms under a worldwide tax system 
are also tax-favored targets of foreign acquirers.  We ﬁnd that U. S.  ﬁrms with locked-out earnings are tax-favored to foreign 
acquirers (or equivalently tax-disfavored to U. S.  acquirers).  
Foreign earnings “lockout” results when ﬁrms avoid or delay foreign earnings repatriation.  Under the U.
