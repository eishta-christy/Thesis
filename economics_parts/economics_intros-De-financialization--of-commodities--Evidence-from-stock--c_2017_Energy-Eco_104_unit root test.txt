 1.  Introduction After the equity market collapsed in 2000, many institutions considered commodities a new asset class after the widely publicized discovery of a negative correlation between commodity returns and stock returns by Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2006) and Erb and Harvey (2006).  As a result, billions of investment dollars ﬂowed into commodity markets from ﬁnancial institutions, insurance companies, pension funds, foundations, hedge funds, and wealthy individuals (Wang et al. , 2015.  Mi et al. , 2017).  A sharp increase in the popularity of commodity investing in the past decade has triggered an unprecedented inﬂow of institutional funds into commodity futures markets, referred to as the ﬁnancialization of commodities (Basak and Pavlova, 2016).  In recent years, many experts have noticed the inﬂuence of ﬁnancialization on commodity markets or the correlation between commodity markets and ﬁnancial markets.  As stated by Tang and Xiong (2012), the large index investment ﬂow precipitated a fundamental process of ﬁnancialization among commodity markets, and the vast inﬂows led to a process of integration of commodity futures markets with other ﬁnancial markets in which portfolio rebalancing of index investors can cause volatility spillovers from outside to commodity markets.  Speciﬁcally, they document that the co-movement between oil and other commodities has risen dramatically following the inﬂow of institutional investors starting fromRecently, Adams and Glück (2015) show that large inﬂows into commodity investments, i. e. , ﬁnancialization, has changed the behavior and dependence structure between commodities and the general stock market, and predict that the spillovers between commodities and the stock market to remain high in the future, given that institutional investors continue to target funds into commodities.  Basak and Pavlova (2016) ﬁnd that with ﬁnancialization, i. e. , in the presence of institutional investors, the prices and volatilities of all commodity futures go up, but more so for the index futures than for non-index ones.  Meanwhile, the correlations among commodity futures as well as in equitycommodity correlations also increase, with higher increase for index commodities.  Some authors focus on the ﬁnancialization related with oil markets.  Based on the empirical results, Juvenal and Petrella (2015) support the view that the recent oil price increase is mainly driven by the strength of global demand but that the ﬁnancialization process of commodity markets also plays a role.  Yin and Yang (2016) conﬁrm that the predictive power of technical indicators outperforms the wellknown macroeconomic variables, and their ability to predict the oil price stems in part from its ability to predict changes in sentiment, suggesting the ﬁnancialization of oil markets.  Besides, stronger investor interest in commodities may create closer integration with conventional asset markets (Babcock, 2012.  Silvennoinen and Thorp, 2013.  Yao et al. , 2017).  as a result, the ﬁnancialization process also enhances the correlation between commodity markets and ﬁnancial markets.  In order to assess how commodities and ﬁnancial markets are inter-related during 1983–2013, Aboura and Chevallier (2015) introduce a ‘volatility surprise’ component into the asymmetric DCC with one exogenous variable (ADCCX) framework, and ﬁnd that return and volatility spillovers do exist between commodity and ﬁnancial markets and that in turn, their relative impact on each other is very substantial.  Silvennoinen and Thorp (2013) estimate sudden and gradual changes in correlation among stocks, bonds and commodity futures returns, and ﬁnd that most correlations begin the 1990s near zero but closer integration emerges around the early 2000s and reaches peaks during the recent crisis, and higher volatility index (VIX) also increases commodity returns correlation with equity returns for about half the pairs, indicating closer integration.  Due to the wide openness and free movement for investment funds in the U. S.  stock market, international crude oil and natural gas markets, a large number of investment funds can swarm into and out of these markets with limited restrictions and the dynamics of stock market volatility becomes a crucial impetus for crude oil and natural gas price ﬂuctuations and investment decisions.  Meanwhile, crude oil and natural gas play strategic roles in social economic development around the world, and the extreme volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices tends to signiﬁcantly affect the economic situation and stock market returns (Aboura and Chevallier, 2016).  As a result, there can be found close interaction among these markets.  in particular, the inﬂuence of stock market instability on crude oil and natural gas markets has received extensive attention from academics, practitioners and government (Zhang and Wei, 2011.  Mohanty et al. , 2011.  Broadstock and Filis, 2014.  Bianconi and Yoshino, 2014). 1 Moreover, the degree of investor risk appetite has proven to affect the volatility of stock market returns (Kim et al. , 2014), and caused the ﬂuctuations of crude oil and natural gas markets.  Consequently, some authors ﬁnd that stock market investment risk appetite may have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on crude oil and natural gas markets (Sari et al. , 2011).  The volatility index (VIX) of stock markets is often regarded as a proxy for risk aversion or investor sentiment (Bekaert et al. , 2011.  Silvennoinen and Thorp, 2013).  Speciﬁcally, the higher of the VIX becomes, the more uneasy investors would feel about the stock markets.  Conversely, the lower the VIX appears, the smoother the changes of stock market index will be.  Among the empirical studies, Kurov (2010) shows that the market investors' sentiment (using VIX as one of the proxies) plays a signiﬁcant role in the impact of the monetary policies on the stock markets, and monetary policy shocks have strong impact on investors' sentiment in bear markets.  To dig further on this analysis, we study the relationship and correlation dynamics between crude oil, natural gas and stock market risk aversion or investor sentiment as captured by the VIX and VSTOXX indexes in this paper.  Namely, we investigate whether the crude oil and natural gas market volatility is inﬂuenced by the VIX in the stock market or whether these different variables move all together.  Our objective lies in answering the following research questions.  What are the interactions between crude oil, natural gas and stock market VIX.  Do some of these markets move together over time.  Whether the de-ﬁnancialialization in energy commodities occurs after the 2008 global ﬁnancial crisis.  These questions are essential to understand whether crude oil and natural gas markets are driven only by their fundamentals, or whether there is also a systemic component inﬂuenced by the volatility present within the stock markets.  The empirical results indicate that the turbulent periods coincide with an increase in cross-market co-movements.  Our ﬁndings support the existence of contagion from stock market panic on crude oil and natural gas markets, and show that the ﬁnancialization of crude oil and natural gas markets remains after the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, while there is no de-ﬁnancialization after all.  The rest of the paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 presents the relevant literature review.  Section 3 gives research methods and data descriptions in this paper.  Section 4 provides the empirical results and analyses, and Section 5 concludes.  2.  Relevant literature review.  The VIX is a volatility index quoted on the Chicago Board of Option exchange since 1990 and uses the call and put option of different maturities with the S&P 500 index as an underlying.  It is computed as the weighted average on the price of these options (call and put) and represents the annualized volatility of the last 30 days of the S&P 500 with percentage.  The VIX has often been called the “investor fear” index.  In fact, it is deducted from the price of the option.  A high option price means a high price for uncertainty.  This is why the VIX has often been used as a proxy for market sentiment or as an “investor fear gauge” by practitioners (as mentioned by Whaley, 2000).  More generally, it is often used by traders and studies as an index for global risk perception on the ﬁnancial markets (Sari et al. , 2011).  A growing number of studies argue that there exists obvious impact of stock market VIX on crude oil and natural gas markets.  For example, Broadstock and Filis (2014) argue that stock market return is affected by the VIX and there is signiﬁcant time-varying linkage between crude oil price and stock returns.  In particular, since the VIX implies the market risk perception of investors, Sari et al.  (2011) ﬁnd the long-run equilibrium relationship between global risk perception and world crude oil price, and oil price may be affected by the short-term negative impact of the shocks on global investors risk perception.  The changes of stock market VIX prove to be often inﬂuenced by the uncertainties of ﬁnancial and economic situation, and then exert some shocks on crude oil and natural gas markets.  Some literature indicates that the interaction between the VIX and ﬁnancial risk variables proves signiﬁcant (Cochran et al. , 2012).  as a result, crude oil and natural gas prices would see signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations when ﬁnancial and economic environment changes (Kolodziej et al. , 2014), and then crude oil and natural gas market prices would be impacted by the increasing degree of VIX due to the uncertainty in investment environment.  During the recent ﬁnancial crisis, monetary policies have been adjusted meanwhile the VIX has also appeared signiﬁcant changes, which is consistent with the contagion effect and interdependence between crude oil and stock markets (Wen et al. , 2012).  speciﬁcally, when one market is impacted by some new information, the volatility in the other market would be inﬂuenced as well (Vo, 2011).  It should be noted that a body of studies have shed light upon the inﬂuence of the VIX on oil returns, but fewer have been conducted on the impact of the VIX on natural gas markets.  Panagioditis and Rutledge (2007) document over a period from 1996 to 2003 that UK crude oil and natural gas markets (Brent and NBP) are strongly interrelated and cointegrated.  Due to oilformula indexation present in gas contract, to the proximity of oil and gas reserves and to the substitutability of these two markets, it is often admitted that these both markets were strongly interconnected.  However, they have different pricing mechanisms.  therefore, it is imperative to examine the impact of stock market VIX on natural gas markets.  To sum up, the stock market VIX reﬂects the complexity of investors' psychological process, and is inﬂuenced by various factors simultaneously.  Meanwhile, it has signiﬁcant time-varying property, which causes the spillover effect of the VIX on crude oil and natural gas markets to be also time-varying.  However, little literature has shed light upon the time-varying spillover effect of stock market VIX (or VSTOXX from the European side) on crude oil and natural gas markets.  Besides, unexpected events are very common in stock markets to affect investors' returns, but little literature investigates its inﬂuence and considers the threshold volatility spillover between stock market VIX and crude oil and natural gas markets.  In fact, the results based on the volatility spillover will be helpful to foresee crude oil and natural gas market ﬂuctuations, so as to effectively design investment portfolios and address market extreme risks.  <Middle> Methods and data.  3. 1.  Methods.  In order to highlight the spillover effect between stock markets VIX on commodities, multivariate GARCH-type models have mostly been used in the literature on volatility transmission as they allow for the joint modeling of variances and covariances between different variables.  Among the different speciﬁcations of multivariate GARCH models, (i. e. , CCC, DCC, VECH and BEKK),2 we propose to use the methodological framework of the Volatility-Threshold Dynamical Conditional Correlation (VT-DCC) put forward by Kasch and Caporin (2013) in this paper.  The econometric procedures unfold for six daily time series taken from the American and European markets.  Speciﬁcally, WTI crude oil, Henry Hub natural gas, and the stock market VIX composes the U. S.  markets, while Brent price, Natural Gas Balancing Point and the VSTOXX form the European markets.  In order to determine which variables behave similarly, we ﬁrst apply the Zivot and Andrews (2002) unit root test with endogenous break detection on the raw series.  This test constitutes our ﬁrst attempt to understand the interactions at stake among these variables, and to detect clusters.
