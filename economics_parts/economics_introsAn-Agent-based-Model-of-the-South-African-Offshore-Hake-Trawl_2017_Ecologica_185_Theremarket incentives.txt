In South Africa, the hake ﬁshing industry is an important contributor
to income in coastal communities, generating some 30,000 jobs
(Rademeyer Name, 2008).  It is also the country's most valuable ﬁshery
(Butterworth and Rademeyer, 2005.  Petersen Name, 2010), generating
an estimated 5 billion South African Rand (ZAR) per year at present. 
The costs, revenues and proﬁts in this industry are much the same as
those incurred by ﬁsheries internationally, such as fuel and market
price for ﬁsh (e. g.  the target species Merluccius capensis and M. 
paradoxus).  It is, however, a highly consolidated and vertically integrated industry with heterogeneous business models and a high level of
complexity (Cooper Name, 2014).  This makes the relative importance
and complex interactions and trade-offs among different drivers like
fuel price and environmental variability for the industry and its proﬁts
hard to estimate at a glance. 
It is known that economic, ecological and social dimensions must be
appropriately considered to ensure successful management for the sustainability of ﬁsheries (Folke Name, 2007.  Garcia and Charles, 2008. 
Pitcher and Lam, 2010).  Effective policies for the sustainability of
human (social and economic) and natural systems are underpinned
by untangling the complexities of these systems, such as emergent
properties and reciprocal effects (Liu Name, 2007).  To be able to meaningfully incorporate ecological and human dimensions into management through appropriate objectives with measurable outcomes or
indicators for South Africa's hake ﬁshery, it is necessary to ﬁrst have insight into the functioning of the industry and how its proﬁts are affected
by changes in some of its major drivers.  Proﬁtability is a signiﬁcant incentive for commercial ﬁshing companies (Sumaila Name, 2008). 
A modelling approach can provide insight into this type of complex
system and its structure, function and dynamics (Liu Name,2007), particularly in a situation such as South Africa's where publically available
economic data on the ﬁsheries is scarce.  Scenario testing provides further understanding of how changes in external drivers affect the
industry's structure, function or dynamics.  Achieving insight into the
South African offshore demersal hake trawl ﬁshery was the impetus behind the building of HakeSim, an agent-based model (ABM) of the ﬁshery (Cooper, 2015.  Cooper and Jarre, 2017).  HakeSim captures the
complex industry structure, complete with heterogeneous company,
vessel and market agents, as well as important factors that affect the
industry's proﬁtability such as fuel price, total allowable catch, environmental variability (through a proxy), domestic and international market
price and demand for hake. 
Fuel price is one factor that majorly affects running costs and therefore proﬁtability of the offshore hake trawl industry.  It can account as
much as 60% of running costs for ﬁshing companies (Sumaila Name,
2008).  It is well known as a core issue affecting ﬁsheries economics
and dynamics worldwide and, for example, has been identiﬁed as particularly signiﬁcant for the proﬁtability of wetﬁsh trawlers that land
fresh ﬁsh in neighbouring Namibia (BCLME, 2006.  Gasalla Name, 2010. 
Sumaila Name, 2008).  Even where it accounts a lower percentage (10
or 25%), such as in other trawl industries, it can hinder ﬁsheries in the
case of a price increase (Sumaila Name, 2008).  Arnason (2007) point
out that increased fuel prices from 2004 meant signiﬁcant increases in
cost and reductions in proﬁt, which could push companies already not
making a proﬁt into exiting the ﬁshery.  Anecdotally, the South African
industry complained of critical interactions between fuel price and
catch per unit effort (CPUE) during high fuel price periods and that it
was difﬁcult to sustain proﬁts at these times.  Previous modelling scenario analysis with HakeSim demonstrated that prices above ZAR 18. 783
per litre, prices that could occur with a large fuel price increase or removal of fuel subsidies, caused all modelled companies to make a loss
and lower fuel prices than this could cause companies to make an unacceptably low return on investment to continue operations (Cooper and
Jarre, 2017).  Should such an increase occur in future, in light of a deteriorating currency (ZAR), a global fuel price rise or a decrease in fuel subsidy, it is possible that industry could offset losses by increasing revenue
streams.  It is unknown to what extent this is possible or how different
companies might cope with these kinds of challenges.  To be able to assess this it is useful to consider different types of costs and revenues for
companies and the variation between these variables at an individual
company or vessel level. 
Additionally, there may be other variable costs to the industry such
as labour or storage costs, and ﬁxed costs such as repairs and maintenance or insurance (Whitmarsh Name, 2000).  On the other hand, since
it is an export-dominated ﬁshery (Crosoer Name, 2006), market demand
and international price (in Euros or US dollars) for hake, as well as the
foreign exchange rate for the ZAR are important determinants of income
to local companies.  Indeed, exchange rate is known to be an important
factor for ﬁsheries and countries that export ﬁsh worldwide (Asche,
2014).  The changes to and interactions among these and other variables
that affect costs and revenue determine short-term gross proﬁts.  They
also determine economic proﬁts over the long term together with depreciation and opportunity costs (Whitmarsh Name, 2000).  Understanding how proﬁts of different types of companies might be affected is
signiﬁcant since changes to proﬁt not only affect companies and their
employees, but are also of social and environmental signiﬁcance, for example on government decisions for public support or subsidies
(Arnason, 2007). 
It is not just the overall proﬁt that is important to companies, but
also variance in proﬁt, which is a form of risk.  Since companies in the
South African offshore hake trawl industry differ in their rightsholdings,
the composition and numbers of vessels that they own, the products
that they sell and their core business structure (Cooper Name, 2014),
they might make different trade-offs between proﬁt and risk.  They can
also be quite differently affected by increased risk due to (environmental) variability in catches.  This type of individual level variability and the
collective, emergent properties at a ﬁsheries system level that result
from the interactions of these individual companies, vessels and markets are not captured in traditional economic models, but can be captured with an ABM. 
Furthermore, the overall ﬂeet size and composition of the entire
hake trawl industry has changed signiﬁcantly through time (Cooper Name, 2014), and this presumably reﬂects trade-offs between proﬁt (i. e. 
vessel costs balanced against revenue under different catch and market
conditions) and deviation in proﬁts.  Understanding how proﬁt risk
trade-offs affect ﬂeet structure help to inform management and policies
regarding what vessels companies can operate and how they operate
them.  For example, in Namibia government apportionment restrictions
enforce a certain composition of wetﬁsh to freezer trawlers (Kirchner
and Leiman, 2014), whereas the South African government has allowed
companies to allocate their catch between vessels as they see ﬁt. 
The objectives of the present paper are to use HakeSim to 1) examine trade-offs and interactions among industry drivers, such as fuel price
and environmental variability, for example to understand whether
losses due to high fuel price or low catches could somehow be offset
and 2) examine the trade-offs in risk (variation in proﬁt) and proﬁt
that companies experience for different company sizes and structures,
and different ﬂeet compositions and sizes in the South African context. 
it will provide insight into their different business strategies and how
these might fare under different levels of uncertainty.  As an ABM
HakeSim incorporates individual variability and interactions and how
these result in observable patterns (emergent properties) at the ﬁsheries system level, as well as qualitative data, it will provide a novel way of
examining these interactions and trade-offs in the absence of extensive
quantitative economic data.  It will also provide insights into why consolidation in the industry continues to happen despite governments attempts to divide up quota, as discussed in (Cooper Name, 2014), an
important point in light of upcoming long term rights allocations. 
<Middle> Methods. 
To test a variety of scenarios for the offshore demersal hake trawl industry of South Africa, the model HakeSim was used, as described in
Cooper and Jarre (2017).  The core features of its design are summarised
here for convenience.  It is an ABM of the industry that captures the individual variability of and interactions among companies, ﬁshing vessels and the domestic and international markets (‘clients’), which are
modelled as agents.  There are three types of ﬁshing vessel agents, four
types of company agents that represent the four types of consolidated
business entities described in Cooper Name (2014), and eleven client
agents (see submodels in Fig.  1).  Client agents represent the South African domestic market for hake as well as the major export markets for
hake that import on average 500 t or more of hake per annum from
South Africa (Spain, Italy, Portugal, United Kingdom, Australia, France,
Germany, the United States of America and the Netherlands) plus one
agent that represents the collective South African hake imports of all
countries that import on average less than 500 t per annum. 
As shown in Fig.  1, ﬁshing vessels are activated as appropriate by the
companies that own them to catch and land hake as fresh or frozen ﬁsh. 
The company's objective is to catch all of its monthly quota using the
minimum number of vessels and also to apportion catch between
fresh and frozen vessels depending on international demand.  As such,
each company ﬁrst determines whether there is an international market demand for fresh or frozen ﬁsh and then appropriately activates
fresh, freezer or both types of vessels.  Each company activates sufﬁcient
vessels from its own ﬂeet to capture the monthly proportion of the
company's quota (which is equal to the right multiplied by the total allowable catch averaged across months).  Type and quantity of landings
are therefore emergent.  Type of landings (fresh versus frozen) are
therefore determined by international market demand.  The quantity
of landings is determined by TAC, CPUE, an environmental variability
proxy (which operates to a prescribed extent on variability of the
CPUE) and the capacity of vessels available to each company.  The
model therefore assumes that TAC is reﬂective of hake population
levels, which is not an unreasonable assumption in the South African
context where TAC is calculated annually on the basis of an extensive
stock assessment modelling and review process (Field Name, 2013).  Unlike in many international contexts, the South African hake TAC is typically the amount recommended on the basis of the stock assessment
models.  Moreover, as TAC is the operational variable that limits catches
by vessels, in the context of questions asked of industry proﬁtability,
drivers and proﬁt-risk trade-offs, it was more relevant to use than population models, at least for this prototype version of the model. 
Landed ﬁsh is then processed by companies to end-product that is ﬁnally sold on to clients in this model.  The assumption is that all ﬁsh is
processed according to the individual company's fresh and frozen ﬁsh
processing efﬁciency coefﬁcients, giving a ﬁnal per-company volume
of processed product.  Clients have as their objective to satisfy their demand for fresh and frozen processed ﬁsh, and will buy from as many
companies as necessary to achieve this.  Final sales volumes and revenue
per company are emergent, as are ﬁnal product volumes bought and
money spent by clients. 
Joint product is not included in the model.  In all procedures, hake is
separated into fresh and frozen ﬁsh, including landings, processing in
companies, values and sales to clients.  Modelled companies generate
revenue from the sales of hake made to different clients, as an emergent
property.  Modelled clients purchase in foreign currency (Euros) and the
ZAR revenue equivalent is based on the foreign exchange rate.  Modelled
companies also accrue variable and non-variable costs.  these include
maintenance costs, stafﬁng and the running of active vessels.  Costs are
also an emergent property, as are ﬁnal proﬁts.  Model companies calculate short-term, gross proﬁts (ZAR) as the balance between total revenue and total costs.  The full details of these procedures, their
associated equations and how their values for a standard run were
calculated may be found in (Cooper and Jarre, 2017).  HakeSim was implemented in Netlogo 5. 0. 1 and successfully subjected to thorough testing, including assumption analyses, thorough sensitivity analyses and
independent implementation and testing of submodels (Cooper and
Jarre, 2017).  During model testing, and also for the scenarios that follow,
100 replicate runs were made in HakeSim using the BehaviorSpace tool
built into Netlogo 5. 0. 1.  output values were recorded at every time-step. 
3.  Scenario Analysis. 
3. 1.  Interactions Among Industry Drivers. 
Fuel prices beyond ZAR18. 783 per litre of diesel can rapidly drive
companies to make a loss and ultimately to exit the South African offshore hake ﬁshery (Cooper and Jarre, 2017), resulting in job losses in
vulnerable coastal communities.  A fuel price above this level is a possibility given that global fuel prices are likely to increase in future as fossil
fuel resources dwindle.  In general, fuel price is known to be a core issue
in ﬁshery economics and dynamics and to interact with other variables
including those that affect fuel consumption (e. g.  nature of target species or weather) and the value of landings, to affect costs and proﬁts
(Cheilari Name, 2013.  Gasalla Name, 2010.  Sumaila Name, 2008).  It will be
useful to understand how fuel price interacts with other key drivers to
determine proﬁtability in the industry and how losses resulting from
fuel price increases could be offset.  Scenarios that examine interactions
of high (ZAR18. 783 per litre) and low (ZAR1. 574 per litre, the minimum
price per litre from the 2000–2012 diesel time series.  Cooper and Jarre,
2017) fuel prices with CPUE, environmental stochasticity, exchange rate
and market price were examined (Tables 1–4). 
As was expected, there were clear interactions between CPUE and
fuel price in determining company costs and hence proﬁtability (Table
1.  Fig.  2a).  Irrespective of fuel price, all companies made a proﬁt when
CPUE was high and a loss when it was low.  The higher the fuel price,
the greater the loss.  CPUE had a greater overall effect on whether companies remained proﬁtable or not, due to the fact that CPUE has a twofold effect in the model.  Firstly, it inﬂuences the catch cost per tonne the lower the CPUE the greater the effort and the more fuel used.  Secondly, it inﬂuences the maximum catching ability of modelled vessels
– if CPUE is low, with all vessels active it may still be difﬁcult for companies to catch their entire quota, meaning reduced volumes of ﬁsh for
sale and hence proﬁts.  This suggests, given a raised fuel price, companies may seek to increase CPUE to offset losses. 
This is commonly observed elsewhere.  fuel price increases have
often resulted in changes to ﬁshing behaviour in an attempt to reduce
effort, improve gear and increase energy efﬁciency, all of which serve
to increase CPUE (Abernethy Name, 2010.  Cheilari Name, 2013.  Parente
Name, 2008).  Such changes to behaviour can have consequences, such
as concentrating ﬁshing effort in certain areas, generally closer to port
(Cheilari Name, 2013), and could ultimately compromise long term resource sustainability.  If it is difﬁcult to easily increase CPUE further
under a higher fuel price, ﬁshers might also reduce effort, as a strategy
for cost savings, which in turn would mean lower overall catches and
economic hardship for ﬁshers (Abernethy Name, 2010).  Because South
African companies wish to demonstrate their ability to catch their allocated quota to ensure reallocation of rights and to continue to meet client demands, they may often continue to ﬁsh irrespective of raised fuel
prices and lowered CPUE and take a short-term loss, so long as they
maintained proﬁts over a longer term.  It is likely companies would not
be able to survive long term losses due to sustained low CPUE, particularly if it were coupled with a high fuel price. 
On top of the interaction between fuel price and CPUE there is another component to the certainty of catching ﬁsh which is captured in the
model through the variable ‘stochasticity of catching ﬁsh’ (SF). 1 This variable allows some uncertainty in the catching of ﬁsh (i. e.  the ‘environment’) to be added, since it dictates how stochastic the CPUE is for
each ﬁshing trip.  It essentially creates a speciﬁed level of random variance in catches in an attempt to incorporate a proxy for environmental
uncertainty into the model.  Scenarios of average and high SF in situations where fuel price is low and high were explored (Table 2).  Low
SF scenarios were not considered, since they were considered uninformative as in reality there is always some variability in catches.  Fuel
price determined proﬁtability irrespective of SF (Fig.  2b), indicating
modelled fuel price was a more important determinant of cost and
hence proﬁt levels.  Nevertheless, increasing SF increased costs, reducing
proﬁts.  As such, uncertainty reduces proﬁts in favourable conditions,
and could under certain unfavourable conditions be the nail in the cofﬁn
that pushes companies to make unbearable losses. 
Local fuel price and exchange rate are usually linked.  when the ZAR
devalues, fuel price increases, since oil is priced in US dollars.  At the
same time, since hake is an export market, a higher ZAR value equivalent is obtained for the same Euro price of exported ﬁsh.  Thus changes
in exchange rate have multiple and complex effects on company proﬁts. 
To be able to explore the outcome of the complex interactions of companies with multiple markets, scenarios of different ZAR/Euro exchange
rates and fuel prices were explored in the model.  As fuel price (in
ZAR) and exchange rate are usually linked in South Africa, linked scenarios were explored to determine how exchange rate changes might
actually affect ZAR proﬁts through revenue and cost changes.  But
worst case, strengthened ZAR and high fuel price – presumably low
ZAR revenue and high US $ fuel cost, and best case (weakened ZAR
and low US $ fuel price) scenarios were also explored to see how the industry might fare when relative changes in the oil price and exchange
rate were decoupled (Table 3). 
The value of ﬁsh sold increased substantially when exchange rate increased (i. e.  when the ZAR devalued), and the costs to companies increased when fuel price increased, but to a lesser extent (Fig.  2c).  The
resulting interaction between costs and revenue determined proﬁts
for companies.  i. e.  at some break-even point fuel price and exchange
rates would intersect and proﬁts would be zero.  Analysis of scenarios
conﬁrmed that in the worst case scenario companies made a loss,
while in the best case scenario large proﬁts were made by companies. 
In the linked scenarios, which are more commonly observed in the
real world, companies maintained positive proﬁts whether exchange
rate and fuel price were both high or low.  Proﬁts were greater when
both fuel price and exchange rate were high than when both were
low.  Thus the increased value of ﬁsh with a devalued ZAR outweighed
the increased fuel cost, leading to a positive proﬁt.  This means that companies would likely be able to maintain proﬁtability in the face of higher
fuel prices (up to a point) if the ZAR was devalued.  Importantly these results also suggest that exchange rate, where CPUE and other variables
are average, can outweigh the effect of fuel price on proﬁt, which is signiﬁcant given the importance of fuel price interacting with CPUE described for this study and elsewhere (Abernethy Name, 2010.  Cheilari
Name, 2013). 
Given the scenario of a ﬁxed exchange rate and an increase in world
fuel prices, resulting in a higher ZAR cost of fuel, it is interesting to examine to what extent the Euro equivalent market value of ﬁsh would
need to increase to compensate the loss incurred by increased fuel
costs.  Scenarios of different price paid by countries for hake (i. e.  market
value of hake) with high fuel price were run to explore this (Table 4). 
As the price paid (pp) by countries increased the value of ﬁsh sold
and consequently company proﬁt increased (Fig.  2d).  For a ﬁxed average exchange rate and the average market value of ﬁsh, a high fuel
price resulted in losses being made.  at (current) average conditions
ﬁrms had a tight proﬁt margin.  This suggests that at the given exchange
rate should US $ fuel price increase and the international market price of
hake not increase, companies would make a loss.  However, even an increase of market value by 25% across the board for countries was
enough to cause model companies to make a proﬁt under high fuel
price and ﬁxed exchange rates.  Any increases in international market
value of hake above this further increased proﬁts through direct
increases in the value of ﬁsh sold by companies.  Therefore, companies
could offset increased costs, e. g.  fuel, by increasing the price paid for
products.  They of course have little ability to inﬂuence market value
for hake, as they are price takers in the current international market
where they compete with many other hake and whiteﬁsh suppliers
such as Spain, Portugal, Chile and Argentina (BCLME, 2004).  Additionally, many ﬁshermen worldwide have little control over market value, because of the price-making power of ﬁsh buyers (Abernethy Name, 2010). 
South African hake companies do, however, have the ability to valueadd their product and shift towards a product that yields a higher
Euro value per tonne, as this would have a similar effect to increasing
market value for hake.  Indeed, this type of product displacement towards a higher value (and lower catch cost value) product was seen
in an analysis of South African hake export data, where companies
switched from whole fresh ﬁsh towards value added frozen product,
which had a lower catch cost per tonne and a higher international market value per tonne (Cooper, 2015). 
3. 2.  Interactions of TAC and CPUE With Company Fleets. 
If mismatches between TAC and CPUE occur because of time lags in
CPUE being incorporated into hake population predictions and therefore TAC recommendation, it could lead to mismatched ﬁshing capacity
(i. e.  number of boats) and CPUE and consequently desynchronized investment in vessels.  During consultation the offshore hake trawl industry anecdotally reported that mismatches between TAC and CPUE can
make it difﬁcult for companies to downsize their ﬂeets or for companies
with downsized ﬂeets to catch their entire quota.  Companies may maintain larger ﬂeet sizes than are efﬁcient to be able to catch all quota in
years were TAC was high and CPUE was low, since demonstrating the
capacity to catch ones quota is a key factor in future reallocation of
rights.  (There are also market incentives to fulﬁl contracts with clients. )
This raised an interesting question in whether such ‘capacity to capture
quota’ policies could help to create perverse incentives for companies to
ﬁsh when lower CPUEs could be indicating poor performance of stocks.
