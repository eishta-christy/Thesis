Accounting research has long shown that managers face pressure to meet earnings benchmarks and that they react to
this pressure by manipulating accruals and real activities when their firm is at risk of missing benchmarks (e. g. , Dechow
Name 2010, §5. 5).  Survey evidence suggests that, in order to meet benchmarks, managers prefer taking real actions over
manipulating accruals (Graham Name, 2005).  Empirical studies provide strong evidence for real activities management (e. g. 
Roychowdhury, 2006; Cohen Name, 2008).  Importantly, real activities management is difficult for investors to detect in the
short run (Kothari Name, 2016) but potentially has negative consequences for firms’ long-run performance (e. g. , Bhojraj Name,
2009; Cohen and Zarowin, 2010).  In this study, we provide evidence of a previously undocumented consequence of real
activities management to meet earnings benchmarks – compromises in workplace safety.  In particular, we show that
benchmark beating is associated with higher workplace injuries and that the strength of this association varies with employee workloads and discretionary expenses that include safety-related expenditures. 
Earnings benchmarks can relate to workplace safety in at least two ways.  First, if managers believe that the firm may
miss expectations under the ordinary course of business, they may increase employees’ workloads or pressure them to work
faster.  In response, employees can compromise safety by overexerting themselves or by circumventing safety procedures
that slow the flow of work.  Second, managers may cut explicit and implicit safety costs, such as the costs of maintaining
equipment and training employees, in their attempts to report higher earnings.  Along these lines, Graham Name (2005)
report that some CFOs admit to cutting maintenance spending in order to meet earnings benchmarks.  To the extent
managers take such actions, workplace safety will deteriorate when firms struggle to meet expectations. 
We examine whether firms suspected of managing earnings to meet expectations exhibit higher workplace injury rates
than other firms.  We follow prior research on earnings management and define firms that meet or just beat expectations as
suspect firms (e. g. , Burgstahler and Dichev, 1997; Degeorge Name, 1999).  Using establishment-level (e. g. , store or factory)
injury data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for the 2002–2011 period, we find that about
one in every 24 employees is injured in firms that meet or just beat analyst earnings forecasts, compared to about one in 27
in firms that miss or comfortably beat forecasts.  In multivariate analyses, where we control for a variety of establishmentand firm-level characteristics as well as establishment (or firm) and year fixed effects to account for unobservable factors,
we find that the association between benchmark beating and injury rates remains statistically and economically significant.
