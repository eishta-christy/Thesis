 1.  Introduction Energy supply and production disruptions can have severe consequences in the entire economy.  For example, the natural gas supply disruptions experienced by Argentina in 2004 led to power generation shortages for the industrial and residential demands, leading to signiﬁcant impacts the national economy (Honoré, 2004).  The Northeast power outage of 2003 in the U. S.  affected more than 55 million people and resulted in estimated $10 billion economic losses (Liscouski and Elliot, 2004).  The topic of energy resilience (e. g. , FLYNN, 2012) has received much attention in the recent decades in the study of energy security (e. g. , IEA, 2014.  Vivoda, 2010.  Lefèvre, 2010.  Scheepers et al. , 2007.  Ang et al. , 2015).  The Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD, 2013) deﬁnes resilience as “the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions.  resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover from deliberate attacks, accidents, or naturally occurring threats or incidents”.  Molyneaux et al.  (2012) states that “resilience is the ability to absorb shocks and still retain function”.  Haimes (2009) deﬁned resilience as the “ability of system to withstand a major disruption within acceptable degradation parameters and to recover with a suitable time and reasonable costs and risks”.  Hence, the ability of an economy to recover its essential function of energy supply and production is of fundamental interest in the study of energy resilience.  Despite various attempts to characterize or deﬁne energy resilience, its quantiﬁcation is not straightforward.  Many aforementioned efforts proceed by evaluating performance and contributions from various infrastructural, economic and geographical perspectives, and then aggregating them into a form of composite indicator, for the purpose of comparison and ranking of energy resilience and security (e. g. , see Vivoda, 2010.  Molyneaux et al. , 2012.  Kruyt et al. , 2009).  However, a common critique of such approaches is that there can be signiﬁcant inﬂuence of subjective judgement, e. g.  in determining the relative importances of aggregating various performance indicators.  More importantly, energy-economic systems are generally highly inter-connected, and hence many economic sectors can simultaneously suffer the consequences of energy disruptions (e. g.  in the form of production losses).  Furthermore, the sectoral interdependencies can result in an unforeseen cascade of consequences, due to a seemingly isolated disruption event.  In a similar manner, post-disruption energy-economic recovery is highly dependent on the inter-sectoral connectivities.  Finally, energy resilience can also depend on the speciﬁc energy sectors disrupted, and often, there is limited a priori information or data to suggest which energy sectors are the most vulnerable targets of attack.  Motivated by the above issues, in this paper we propose an Input-Output linear programming model to study the relationships between energy production disruptions, impacts on sectoral production and demands, and post-disruption recovery efforts.  Despite some of their limitations, Input-Output models continue to be widely-adopted and useful formats to depict inter-sectoral dependencies in the economy and energy emission studies (Su and Ang, 2012.  Su and Ang, 2015.  Hoekstra, 2010.  Hawkins et al. , 2015).  Many countries and states have continued to collect, publish and update data for calibrating Input-Output tables (e. g. , 43 countries’ time series IO data in World Input-Output Database Timmer et al. , 2016).  Our proposed methodology uses the economic Input-Output structure, in the format of a linear programming model, to evaluate the impact of a given energy sector’s output disruption on all other sectors’ total outputs and ability to fulﬁl ﬁnal goods demands.  Since energy production disruptions can arise from different sectors (possibly simultaneously) and cannot be anticipated precisely in advance, our proposed model evaluates the maximum impact on the economy, in the form of ﬁnal demand deﬁcits, over a set of (possibly inﬁnite) production disruption scenarios.
