National oil companies (NOCs), that have the government as their
major ownership, control most of the international oil reserves.  In
the early 1970s, NOCs controlled slightly more than 10% of the
world’s oil and gas reserves (Leis Name, 2012).  By the end of 2000s,
NOCs controlled 73% of oil reserves and 65% of gas reserves (Victor
Name, 2011).  The nature of the NOC’s ownership alters its objectives,
and directly inﬂuence the public policies and incentives faced by
company’s managers (Vickers and Yarrow, 1988). 
Despite the importance of the effects of ownership, research on
oil and gas companies is limited.  In fact, the literature has compared
the technical eﬃciency between NOCs and IOCs.  Al-Obaidan and
Scully (1992) state that NOCs generate between 61% and 65% of
the IOCs’ revenues with the same inputs.  Victor (2007) ﬁnds that
revenues from their main commercial objective are generated with
more eﬃciency by IOCs than NOCs.  This author attributes these
ineﬃciencies to several factors, in particular, employment policy
and subsidies for delivered products, among others.  Wolf and Pollitt
(2008) estimate a 3. 6% increase in return on sales, a 35% drop in
employment and an average of 15% increase in total production
when an NOC becomes an IOC.  Wolf (2009) ﬁnds that IOCs encourage superior performance compared to NOCs in terms of output
eﬃciency and proﬁtability.  Eller Name (2011) ﬁnd that NOCs are less
eﬃcient than IOCs, which can be mainly explained by the differences
in the ﬁrms’ objectives.  Likewise, Shleifer and Vishny (1994), Hartley
and Medlock (2008), Eller Name (2011) and Hartley Name (2012) ﬁnd
empirical evidence that non-commercial objectives, such as domestic fuel subsidies and employment – which represent high levels of
employment, unproﬁtable projects, or non-necessary expenditures –
are major sources of reduced economic eﬃciency for many NOCs.

oil companies (IOCs), seeking to generate wealth for their owners –
the citizens.  Nevertheless, governments include non-commercial
objectives in NOCs missions.
