 1.  Introduction The last decade has seen increasing application of efﬁciency frontier models taking the material1 balance principle (MBP) into account to measure ﬁrm and regional level environmental performance and obtain both environmental information and economic outcomes (Coelli et al. , 2007.  Hoang and Coelli, 2011.  Reinhard et al. , 2000).  The main acknowledged advantage of the MBP approach over other methods is that it is founded upon on the Law of the Conservation of Matter (Lauwers, 2009).  According to this law, pollutant emissions from production activities are considered waste residuals (Ayres, 1995.  Ayres and Kneese, 1969.  Pethig, 2006), and are measured as the balance between the potentially pollutant materials that enter the production system (nutrients from agricultural fertilizers, for example) and the materials that are transformed into ﬁnal goods (the nutrients that plants draw from the soil, for example).  From this perspective, it is of signiﬁcant importance to control the quantity and composition of inputs in the production process when dealing with the problem of environmental degradation, because the pollution generated in producing a given level of output will vary according to the quality and quantity of the inputs.  Following this logic, several authors (Lauwers, 2009.  Van Meensel et al. , 2010a.  Welch and Barnum, 2009) have shown that the integration of the MBP into efﬁciency models also has major implications for decision makers.  They show that a strategy for a more efﬁcient management of inputs to reduce pollution generation may provide “win-win” outcomes, that conciliate the economic interest of ﬁrms with the environmental concern of society.  For instance, reducing the overuse of inputs by improving technical efﬁciency has a twofold beneﬁt, since it reduces both production costs and environmental pressure.  Likewise, it is implicit in the MBP approach that part of the improvement in environmental allocative efﬁciency can be achieved while decreasing costs.  For example, Lauwers (2009) and Van Meensel et al.  (2010a, 2010b) measure environmental economic trade-offs in a sample of farms, and ﬁnd half the sample able to achieve simultaneous improvements in cost allocation efﬁciency and environmental efﬁciency, by changing the proportions of their input factors to combinations that are both more environmentally friendly and less costly.  Similarly, Welch and Barnum (2009), in a sample of electricity generation plants, ﬁnd some that are able to achieve joint cost and environmental beneﬁts, by moving from the technical efﬁciency point to the minimum cost point or to the point of lowest pollution.
