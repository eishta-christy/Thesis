Multinational entities (MNEs) face tax incentives to shift taxable income from high-tax jurisdictions to low-tax
jurisdictions by strategically valuing intercompany transactions.  To mitigate tax-motivated transfer prices for goods,
services, intellectual property, and debt, tax authorities require that transfer prices be “arm’s length,” or comparable to
prices charged between independent enterprises (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 2010a). 
Because arm’s length contractual prices are generally unobservable, MNEs often benchmark transfer prices by identifying a
set of observable, economically comparable, and independent companies that use similar accounting standards to compare
profit margins (PWC, 2006).  Specifically, taxpayers calculate the observable range of book profit rates reported by
comparable firms and demonstrate that affiliate taxable profits are within this benchmark range (McKinley and Owsley,
2013).
