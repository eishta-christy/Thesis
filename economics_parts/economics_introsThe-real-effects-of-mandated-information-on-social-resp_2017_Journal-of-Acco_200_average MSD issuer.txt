 
In the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (hereafter, the “Dodd–Frank Act”), policymakers made an unprecedented move towards using securities regulation to address issues unrelated to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) core mission of protecting investors and maintaining the fair and eﬃcient functioning 
of ﬁnancial markets ( Lynn, 2011 ).  Section 1503 of the Dodd–Frank Act requires SEC-registered ﬁrms to include information regarding mine-safety performance in their ﬁnancial reports.  In this paper, we examine the real effects (i. e. , changes 
in mining-related citations, injuries, and labor productivity) of the mandatory inclusion of mine-safety disclosures in the 
ﬁnancial reports (“MSD”) of the 151 SEC-registered ﬁrms whose ownership of a U. S.  mine make them subject to Section 
1503 of the Dodd–Frank legislation.  A key feature of our setting is that the information provided through MSD is already 
publicly available on the Mine Safety and Health Administration’s (MSHA) website; this allows us to isolate and estimate 
the magnitude of the incremental real effects of including information in ﬁnancial reports.  
Section 1503 of the Dodd–Frank Act requires reporting citations for violations of mine-safety regulations both periodically in mine owners’ ﬁnancial reports (i. e. , Forms 10K and 10Q) and immediately upon the receipt of an imminent danger 
order (IDO) through a Form 8K ﬁling.  MSD advocates make the implicit argument that including this information in ﬁnancial reports has implications that such information does not have when only disclosed on the MSHA website.  However, it 
is unclear whether the information included in MSD is news to investors or other interested parties.  One reason the inclusion of safety information in ﬁnancial reports could have an incremental effect is because ﬁnancial reports broadcast the 
information to a wide range of interested parties, thereby increasing awareness of ﬁrms’ safety records.  
If MSD increases awareness of ﬁrms’ safety records, then political costs, reputational concerns, and/or activism by investors or other parties could provide an incentive for managers to improve mine safety.  For example, if managers anticipate 
that the revelation of poor safety performance will have a negative effect on ﬁrm value, they may invest more in safety to 
limit such effects.  Investors may react negatively to poor safety performance either because of the future cash ﬂow consequences or because of their non-cash-ﬂow-based preferences.  Cash ﬂow effects could occur, for example, through ﬁnes, 
mine closures, or other costs imposed by activists.  Non-cash-ﬂow-based preferences could also lead investors to require 
higher returns for ﬁnancing the operations of ﬁrms engaging in activities that conﬂict with those preferences, such as maintaining relatively unsafe working conditions (e. g. , Fama and French, 2007; Friedman and Heinle, 2016 ).  If MSD increases the 
implications of safety issues for ﬁrm value, then MSD will give managers an incentive to alter resource allocation decisions 
to improve safety.  It is also possible that MSD could affect managers’ safety-investment decisions through channels other 
than ﬁrm value, such as, for example, negative reputational costs arising from the public revelation that a manager operates 
a ﬁrm with poor safety conditions.  
Using data obtained from the MSHA, we ﬁrst assess the effect of MSD on the incidence rate of citations for violations 
of mine-safety regulations.  For these analyses, we employ a difference-in-differences (“DiD”) design that compares changes 
in citations issued to mines owned by SEC registrants (“MSD mines”) with those issued to mines owned by non-SEC registrants (“non-MSD mines”) around the effective date of Dodd–Frank.  We control for ﬂexible time trends and static, mine-level 
differences by including both year and mine ﬁxed effects.  We document a decrease in citations per inspection hour of approximately 11% for MSD mines relative to non-MSD mines.  Our evidence suggests this reduction in citations is attributable 
to an increase in compliance with mine safety regulations rather than a change in inspector behavior.  
Next, we analyze the effect of MSD on injury rates.  An im plicit assum ption of MSD, which focuses almost exclusively on 
the reporting of citations for safety violations, is that a decrease in citations will translate into a reduction in injuries.  
However,  the  link  between  compliance  with  mine  safety  regulations  and  actual  safety  improvements  is  debatable  (e. g. , 
Ruffennach, 2002; Gowrisankaran Name, 2015 ).  Consistent with a meaningful improvement in safety, we document a 13% 
decrease in injuries for MSD mines relative to non-MSD mines.  For the average ﬁrm, this 13% reduction translates into 
approximately 0. 2 fewer injuries annually per 100 full-time employees (the equivalent of 200,000 mine-hours worked).  
While the above results suggest that MSD has substantial beneﬁts, it is unlikely that the observed safety improvements 
are costless.  Gowrisankaran Name (2015) posit that mines produce a joint output of safety and mineral production, which 
suggests that an increase in safety could lead to lower mineral production per hour worked.  We examine this tradeoff by 
testing whether productivity in coal mines, where we have measures of production and labor quantities, changes around the 
adoption of MSD.  Using a DiD research design, we ﬁnd evidence of a signiﬁcant reduction in labor productivity following the 
implementation of MSD.  The observed decline translates into increased labor costs of approximately 0. 9% of total revenue.  
A critical assumption of our identiﬁcation strategy is that the trends in mine safety and productivity for MSD and nonMSD mines would have been the same in the absence of MSD (i. e. , the parallel-trends assumption).  We assess the validity 
of this assumption by mapping out the counterfactual treatment effect of MSD in the pre-MSD period (from 2002 to 2009).  
This analysis shows that the trends for MSD and non-MSD mines are similar.  Even given similar pre-treatment trends, other 
factors, such as public outrage over a mining disaster, which differentially affect MSD and non-MSD mines, could potentially 
confound our inferences.  To address this possibility, we ﬁrst demonstrate that there is no difference in the reactions of MSD 
and non-MSD mines to another major regulatory event (the 2006 MINER Act) that pertains to all mines and was triggered 
by events similar to those that led to MSD.  
To provide evidence that an increased public awareness of safety issues is a likely explanation for the observed real 
effects, we assess whether more attention is paid to safety after MSD.  First, we provide descriptive evidence of an increase in 
media and analyst coverage.  Second, we compare short-window stock returns and changes in mutual fund holdings around 
IDO disclosures before and after MSD.  We ﬁnd a 155 (140) basis point more negative average (median) market reaction 
when a safety citation is reported in an 8K ﬁling and disclosed on the MSHA’s website, compared to the period when such 
citations are disclosed only on the website.  These market reactions are most negative for ﬁrms operating primarily in the 
mining industry, where safety violations likely have the greatest implications for ﬁrm value.  
For mutual fund holdings, in the pre-MSD period, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant reduction in ownership in the quarter following an 
IDO announcement, indicating that some sophisticated investors were aware of, and responded to, IDO website disclosures 
prior to MSD.  In the post-MSD period, the reduction in ownership when the safety information is also disseminated through 
an 8K is signiﬁcantly larger, which suggests that mutual fund managers care more about safety issues when other parties’ 
awareness of these issues increases.  These effects are particularly pronounced for funds with explicitly stated preferences 
for socially responsible investment.  
Our paper contributes to the existing literature by documenting the magnitude of the real effects of including information 
on social responsibility in ﬁnancial reports.  Prior research shows accounting disclosures can have real effects because: (i) 
disclosure reduces information asymmetry and agency costs (e. g. , Biddle and Hilary, 2006 ; Biddle Name, 2009 ; McNichols and 
Stubben, 2008 ), (ii) accounting numbers are used in contracts and regulation (e. g. , Holthausen and Leftwich, 1983 ), and (iii) 
managers learn new information from their own disclosures and the disclosures of peers (e. g. , Shroff, 2017 ).  There is also a 
literature that shows that disclosure through channels other than ﬁnancial reports can have real effects ( Jin and Leslie, 2003; 
Chuk, 2013 ).  Our paper contributes to this prior work primarily because mine-safety records are already publicly available 
outside of a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial reports, which allows us to isolate and estimate the incremental effect of including information 
in ﬁnancial reports as opposed to the effects of disclosing information not previously publicly released elsewhere.  
Understanding  the  real  effects  of  regulations  requiring  information  on  social  responsibility  in  ﬁnancial  reports  is  increasingly important given the recent trend towards employing such policies ( Leuz and Wysocki, 2016 ).  U. S.  policymakers 
are currently considering implementing similar reporting requirements for political contributions, conﬂict minerals from 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and, more broadly, the standards issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board.  The European Union (EU) also recently mandated disclosures related to ﬁrms’ environmental, social, and governance 
performance ( Grewal Name, 2015 ).  Although our relatively narrow focus on the mining industry and MSD regulation could 
limit the generalizability of our ﬁndings, our study nonetheless provides direct evidence on the real effects of mandating the 
inclusion of information on social responsibility in ﬁnancial reports—a feature that is common to all of the aforementioned 
initiatives.  
2.  Institutional background. 
The mining industry is both an economically important and historically unsafe sector of the U. S.  economy.  In 2014, the 
mining industry contributed $225. 1 billion to GDP and nearly two million jobs to the U. S.  economy ( NMA, 2014 ).  Since 1900, 
more than 10 0,0 0 0 workers have died and many more have been injured in U. S.  mines ( MSHA, 2014 ).  Although mining is 
no longer among the ten most dangerous jobs in the U. S.  (based on fatalities), it remains one of the most heavily regulated 
sectors in terms of employee health and safety.  
As is often the case with policy interventions, catastrophic events frequently trigger mine-safety regulation ( Ruffennach, 
2002 ).  The Upper Big Branch disaster, which killed twenty-nine miners in West Virginia on April 5, 2010, is among these.  
However, in an unprecedented move, policy-makers turned to securities regulation for a solution.  Following the congressional practice of tacking off-topic provisions onto other pieces of proposed legislation, West Virginia Senator Jay Rockefeller 
IV introduced MSD into the Dodd–Frank Act, which primarily focuses on regulations intended to reform the ﬁnancial services sector.  Public comments suggest that MSD was explicitly motivated by the intention to improve safety rather than aid 
1 Senator Rockefeller himself publicly indicated that the goal of the 
investors in assessing ﬁnancial performance ( Lynn, 2011 ).  
regulation was to “make mine safety a top priority” (Senator John D.  Rockefeller IV, Press Release May 07, 2010), and, not 
surprisingly, the strongest supporters of MSD in comment letters on the regulation written to the SEC were organizations 
representing mine workers (e. g. , the United Mine Workers of America).  
Dodd–Frank Section 1503(a) requires SEC-registered mine owners to include their safety records for U. S.  mines in their 
periodic reports (i. e. , 10Qs and 10Ks for domestic issuers and 20Fs and 40Fs for foreign issuers).  Under the Federal Mine 
Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act), the MSHA is required to inspect surface mines at least twice a year and 
underground mines at least four times a year.  Inspections are also conducted in response to hazardous condition complaints.  
If inspectors identify violations of safety and health standards, they issue citations or orders, which may carry monetary 
penalties or, in some cases, result in mine closures.  Under MSD, from these inspections, issuers must report: severe citations 
for violations of the Mine Act, proposed penalties, legal actions, and fatalities.  Section 1503(b) of the Act also requires issuers 
Unlike most SEC reporting requirements, 
issuers must report safety records even if their omission is unlikely to inﬂuence the decisions of ﬁnancial report users (i. e. , 
there is no materiality threshold for MSD ﬁlings).  In Appendix A , we provide an example of a typical MSD 8K and 10K ﬁling, 
a screenshot from the MSHA website, and a more detailed description of the MSD reporting requirements.  
Importantly, since 20 0 0, the MSHA has disclosed all information included in MSD ﬁlings on its website, typically within 
twenty-four hours, making it a timelier source than the ﬁnancial reports.  The prior disclosure of the safety records allows
us to estimate the effect of including this information in ﬁnancial reports independent from the effects of disclosing the 
information for the ﬁrst time.  
<Middle> Reasons MSD could have real effects. 
If the inclusion of safety information in ﬁnancial reports increases public awareness of safety records, MSD could have 
real effects through managers’ rational anticipation of its implications for cash ﬂows, discount rates, and/or their own reputation.  MSD could affect cash ﬂows by exposing a ﬁrm to heightened political costs, reputational concerns, and activism 
by safety-conscious stakeholders.  
Information on safety could affect a ﬁrm’s discount rate if a signiﬁcant proportion of investors prefer owning ﬁrms with 
strong safety records for reasons independent of the cash ﬂow implications of those safety records.  If a ﬁrm conducts an 
activity in opposition to some investors’ non-cash-ﬂow-based preferences, revelation of this activity will likely decrease the 
demand of those investors, which could in turn affect the ﬁrm’s stock price ( Fama and French, 2007 ).  Friedman and Heinle 
(2016) build on Fama and French (2007) to model the asset pricing implications of CSR, which, given the subject of MSD, is 
directly relevant in our setting.  Their model predicts that, given a suﬃcient number of investors with non-cash-ﬂow-based 
preferences, the market will price CSR disclosures.  
It is also possible that MSD affects managers’ safety-investment decisions through channels other than ﬁrm value.  In the 
mining industry, because of the potential political consequences, the importance of safety goes beyond its direct implications 
for ﬁrm value.  For instance, managers are likely to face reputational costs from the public revelation that they operate 
a ﬁrm with poor safety conditions.  Such costs could manifest on a personal (e. g. , shame) or professional level (e. g. , career 
5 Dewatripont Name (1999) show how managerial incentives can be shaped not only by explicit incentive contracts 
concerns).  
but also by personal reputation and career concerns.  If managers of ﬁrms with poor safety records are less attractive labor 
market candidates, they have a strong incentive to improve safety performance.  
Regardless of the explanation for why safety information affects safety, what creates tension, and allows us to separate the effect of including information in ﬁnancial reports from the ﬁrst-time disclosure of that information, is that all 
mine-safety records in the ﬁnancial reports are already publicly available on the MSHA’s website.  Thus, for MSD to affect 
managers’ incentives to invest in safety, it must increase awareness of ﬁrms’ safety records or lead some interested parties 
to assign greater importance to safety issues.  
One reason MSD could increase awareness is that the information in ﬁnancial reports is more broadly disseminated than 
the information on the MSHA website.  SEC-required disclosures on Forms 8K, 10Q, and 10K are effectively the billboards 
of the ﬁnancial community.  Since ﬁnancial reports are so widely disseminated and have such low incremental acquisition 
costs, after MSD, investors, ﬁnancial analysts, and the news media that follow SEC ﬁlings are more likely to become aware 
of violations of the Mine Act—even if they are not explicitly looking for them.  
Even if relatively sophisticated investors were already familiar with mine safety records prior to MSD, as less sophisticated parties also become aware of safety violations, the cost of investing in a ﬁrm that owns an unsafe mine could increase 
after MSD.  For example, increased awareness that an institutional investor owns a company with a poor safety record could 
lead to heightened public disapproval—particularly if third parties, such as the news media, scrutinize the investor’s portfolio holdings (as may be the case, for example, with university endowments, public pensions, or mutual funds).  
Even if all investors were already fully informed about safety issues, citations might nevertheless become more costly to ﬁrms if other 
stakeholders able to impose costs on ﬁrms (e. g. , activists) become aware of safety issues after MSD.  
In the end, whether the mandatory inclusion of information on social responsibility in ﬁnancial reports has economically 
signiﬁcant real effects is an empirical question.  Our goal in this paper is to estimate the magnitude of any such effects.  
4.  Real effects of MSD. 
In our analyses of the real effects of MSD, we focus on changes in safety citations, mining-related injuries, and labor 
productivity around the enactment of MSD.  
4. 1.  Implications of MSD for mine safety. 
In this section, we assess the effect of MSD on the incidence rate of citations for violations of the Mine Act and miningrelated injuries.  Our empirical strategy relies on the fact that only SEC-registered ﬁrms are subject to Dodd–Frank and, 
hence,  only  mines  owned  by  SEC-registrants  have  their  safety  records  included  in  ﬁnancial  reports.   We  use  a  standard 
difference-in-differences (DiD) framework, where mines owned by non-SEC registrants are the control group.  Our baseline 
model, suppressing year and mine subscripts. 
The dependent variable is either the incidence rate of citations per inspection hour ( Citations ) or injuries per 20 0,0 0 0 
hours worked ( Injuries ).  To mitigate the concern that our inferences could be affected by a change in inspection hours, in 
the citation analysis, we alternatively include the log of inspection hours as a control variable and scale by mine hours 
worked (see Internet Appendix Table IA1).  MSD , the variable of interest, is an indicator coded as one after Dodd–Frank for 
mines disclosed in ﬁnancial reports.  We include year ﬁxed effects to control for changes over time in safety technology and 
regulations other than Dodd–Frank, which likely have a similar effect on both MSD and non-MSD mines.  We include mine 
ﬁxed effects to control for differences in production technologies and other time-invariant factors among mines.  
In this speciﬁcation, we identify the effect of MSD from changes in incidence rates around the entry-into-force date of Dodd–Frank 
for MSD relative to non-MSD mines.  We estimate block-bootstrapped standard errors at the mine-owner level, which adjust 
for the lack of independence within mine owner (e. g. , Bertrand Name, 2004 ).  
The block bootstrap approach adjusts standard errors to account for the lack of independence within mine owner by 
resampling observations (over 100 iterations) at the mine-owner level (i. e. , keeping mine-level observations for a speciﬁc 
owner together).  As an alternative approach, we cluster observations at the mine-owner level using the OLS speciﬁcation 
(see Internet Appendix Table IA1).  
We estimate Eq.  (1) using a standard OLS regression, where we measure incidence rates over both one- and two-year periods.  Although one-year incidence rates are consistent with the length of the 10K reporting period, one year is a relatively 
short interval over which to measure infrequent outcomes such as citations and injuries.  To mitigate this concern, we also 
estimate Eq.  (1) using incidence rates measured over two years.  However, even when measured over two years, the infrequency of citations and injuries still results in a high density of observations at zero.  An OLS regression does not effectively 
account for this concentration of observations, which could lead to biased estimates of the treatment effect ( Wooldridge, 
2002 ).  We therefore also estimate Eq.  (1) using a Poisson regression.  
The Poisson probability distribution captures the infrequent and discrete nature of citations and injuries and is widely 
used to model similar events (e. g. , Rose, 1990; Li Name, 2012 ).  In the Poisson speciﬁcation, the dependent variable is the 
count of citations or injuries.  In the case of citations (injuries), we use inspection hours (hours worked) as the exposure 
variable—meaning the interpretation of the estimated coeﬃcient on MSD is comparable to the OLS speciﬁcation.  We report 
average  treatment  effects  for  both  the  OLS  and  Poisson  regressions  where  incidence  rates  are  measured  over  one-  and 
two-year periods, but because it conceptually best addresses low incidence rates, our preferred speciﬁcation is the Poisson 
regression with incidence rates measured over two years.  
We  obtain  mine-level  data  from  the  U. S.   Department  of  Labor  MSHA  Open  Government  Data  website,  which  compiles 
an array of datasets on health and safety for mining operations located in the U. S.  We use the Inspection, Violation, Accident/Injuries , and CDC Address/Employment (AE) databases.  We include all observations from 2002 to 2013 that meet our 
sample criteria.  We restrict the analyses of injuries to mine-years with at least ﬁve full-time equivalent employees (i. e. , 
more than 10,0 0 0 hours worked) to reduce the inﬂuence of very small mines.  In the OLS regressions, we truncate the top 
1% of incident rates.  We do not truncate the incidence rates in the Poisson speciﬁcation because it is essentially a log-linear 
model, which can effectively deal with outliers without truncation.  We include a relatively long pre-period (six years) to 
enable a better assessment of the parallel-trends assumption (see Section 4. 3. 2 ).  
We determine which mines in the MSHA database are disclosed in ﬁnancial reports (and therefore are included in our 
treatment sample) through a comprehensive search of all relevant ﬁlings in the SEC’s Edgar database.  We provide a detailed 
description of this data collection procedure in Appendix B .  Our control sample consists of all non-MSD mines available in 
the MSHA database (i. e. , those not identiﬁed as MSD mines through the Edgar search).  
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the 151 issuers subject to MSD.  The average MSD issuer owns about 24 mines.  
Relative to the average issuer in Compustat , MSD ﬁrms are larger, with an average book value of total assets of $15B (the 
Compustat average is $12B).
