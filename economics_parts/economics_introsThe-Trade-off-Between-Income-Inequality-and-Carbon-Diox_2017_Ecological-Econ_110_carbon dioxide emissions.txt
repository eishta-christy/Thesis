Reducing global poverty and mitigating climate change are two
major challenges facing mankind in the twenty-ﬁrst century.  Economic
growth leads to absolute poverty reduction, particularly if it is not associated with rising income inequality (e. g.  Dollar and Kraay, 2002;
Bourguignon, 2003).  There is a substantial literature that investigates
the relationship between income and carbon dioxide emissions (the
main driver behind the increase in global surface temperature).  This literature suggests that economic growth, at least up to a certain level of
economic development, increases greenhouse gases (IPCC, 2014;
Jakob Name, 2014).  Consequently, from the perspective of a developing
country, economic growth may alleviate poverty, but intensify climate
problems.  A related issue is whether there is also a tradeoff between income inequality and carbon emissions, as stated by Ravallion Name
(2000).  As we discuss below, the theoretical and empirical literature
generates mixed results on this question, pointing to different mechanisms and effects (for a survey see Berthe and Elie, 2015).  Much of
this literature is, however, based on econometric methods that are biased in the presence of time-varying unobserved heterogeneity, and
on older data on both inequality as well as emissions.  We improve
upon the existing literature in both of these respects. 
A particular innovation with respect to the existing literature is that
we use a group ﬁxed effects estimator (Bonhomme and Manresa, 2015)
as opposed to a standard ﬁxed effects estimator.  This grouped ﬁxed effects estimator takes into account that different regions of the world
adopt clean technologies at different rates or face different structural
challenges and dynamics.  Furthermore, the estimator arguably deals
better with endogeneity due to unobserved heterogeneity.  Finally, the
within transformation associated with the standard country-based
ﬁxed effects estimator would eliminate most of the variation in the
Gini data, leaving only the relatively small intertemporal variation
(see the literature on the debates on inequality and growth literature,
e. g.  Forbes, 2000, Banerjee and Duﬂo, 2003, Scholl and Klasen, 2016). 
To the best of our knowledge, only ﬁve papers are closely related to
our empirical investigation of the link between per capita carbon dioxide emissions, per capita output, and inequality.  There are also related
studies investigating the link between inter-country inequality and
emissions (e. g.  Guo, 2013; Coondoo and Dinda, 2008).  First, Ravallion
Name (2000) use a pooled OLS model that interacts inequality with a
third-order polynomial of income, a time trend, and population size. 
The panel data set consists of 42 countries over the period from 1975
to 1992.  The authors use one (average) inequality measure per country. 
They ﬁnd that there is a static tradeoff between reducing carbon emissions and reducing income inequality.  Second, Borghesi (2006) applies
OLS and ﬁxed effects panel data estimators to a panel data set of 37
countries for the period 1988 to 1995.  He prefers the ﬁxed effects estimator and ﬁnds that inequality does not have an effect on emissions. 
For the pooled OLS estimator, he ﬁnds a statistically signiﬁcant negative
effect between income inequality and carbon dioxide emissions.  Third,
Heerink Name (2001) use a cross-section design with 65 country observations from about 1985.  The speciﬁcation includes income, its square,
and the Gini coefﬁcient.  Similar to Ravallion Name (2000), they ﬁnd
that income inequality is negatively associated with carbon emissions
per capita.  All three studies rely on the inequality measure from the
data set described in Deininger and Squire (1996).  Two further studies
use the University of Texas Inequality data which proxies household inequality with the between sector wage inequality in non-agricultural
sectors.  Drabo (2011) ﬁnds, in a 2SLS ﬁxed effects framework using 86
countries ﬁnds that inequality increases emissions.  Gassebner Name
(2008) use extreme bound analysis for a sample of up to 120 countries
in 1960–2001 and ﬁnd that inequality is robustly associated with smaller CO2 emissions.  The use of the UTIP data, which relates to a particular
aspect of industrial wage inequality, as a proxy for overall inequality is,
however, controversial and can lead to biases (Scholl, 2016). 
Our analysis uses expanded and improved data from Solt (2009),
which is derived from the much broader, more consistent, and more reliable WIDER2 World Income Inequality Database.  This allows us to use
a larger set of countries (158) than the existing literature, and observations from 1980 to 2008, which is larger and more recent than most
existing studies.  Furthermore, we argue that cross-section estimates
based on pooled OLS or related methods are arguably not the most appropriate tools for this analysis, and argue that the group ﬁxed effects
estimator (Bonhomme and Manresa, 2015) is more suitable for the
analysis.  We also compare our analysis to a standard ﬁxed effects
estimator. 3
We ﬁnd that the relationship between income inequality and emissions depends on income levels.  At lower levels of incomes higher income inequality reduces emissions while at higher levels of income,
the effect is reversed.  The group ﬁxed effects also generate interesting
differentiated time trends linked closely to trends in energy intensity
in the different groups. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 reviews theoretical arguments in the existing literature, emphasizing that the relationship between income inequality and emissions is ambiguous. 
Section 3 describes the panel data set.  Section 4 outlines the ﬁxed effects
model for our setting, and reveals its shortcoming in the current context.  We then argue that a group ﬁxed effects estimator is more appropriate, and describe that model.  The main results and a sensitivity
analysis are presented in Section 5.  Section 6 concludes. 
2.  Theory. 
Starting in the mid-1990′s, economists have developed several theoretical arguments to explain the relationship between economic inequality and environmental degradation.  For a full review, please see
Cushing Name (2015) and Berthe and Elie (2015).  Here we only provide
a condensed summary of this very large literature.  While some of the arguments entail a positive association, namely the “equality hypothesis”
proposed by Boyce (1994), Torras and Boyce (1998) and Borghesi
(2006), others argue that greater inequality could also be negatively associated to emissions (Heerink Name, 2001; Ravallion Name, 2000;
Scruggs, 1998).  If the second argument prevails, there will be a tradeoff
between redistribution policies and environmental quality. 
Boyce (1994) proposes that greater inequality could increase environmental degradation via the impact on the rate of time preference
and via a modiﬁed cost-beneﬁt analysis that considers power-weighted
costs and beneﬁts.  Boyce (1994) and Torras and Boyce (1998) assume
that environmental quality is a public good and effective demand requires public policy solutions to this market failure.  The factors which
allow economies to redress market failure more efﬁciently are “vigilance and advocacy”, as pointed out by Grossman and Krueger (1995)
in earlier work.  These two factors increase with per capita income because individuals gain greater power to make their demand effective
through the political process.  In particular, some individuals beneﬁt
from economic activities that generate pollution, whereas other citizens, adversely affected by pollution, bear net cost.  The latter exercise
vigilance and are in charge to demand for environmental controls,
whereas the former attempt to prevent that those environmental controls are established or strengthened.  Assuming that in more unequal
societies those who beneﬁt from pollution are more powerful than
those who bear the cost, the beneﬁt-cost rule will lead to predict an inefﬁcient high level of pollution.  This implies a positive correlation between income inequality and pollution.  A controversial assumption
they made to reach this outcome is that net beneﬁt from polluting activities is positively correlated with individual income.  However, Scruggs
(1998) claims that wealthy and powerful individuals do not necessarily
prefer more degradation than the rest and he also questions Boyce's underlying assumption that more democratic societies produce better environmental results than other political regimes.  Also, it is unclear
whether this argument, which has been formulated for environmental
degradation more generally, also holds for carbon emissions.  In the
case of carbon emissions, costs are not only felt locally but globally
and emission control is a global public good, where it is unclear that national income inequality will necessarily play a critical role in this
mechanism. 
In the same line of reasoning as Boyce (1994), Borghesi (2006)
suggests that an increase in inequality hinders the way for public
policy solutions to environmental problems and therefore greater inequality can contribute to increasing emissions.  Also Marsiliani and
Renstrom (2003) argue that higher inequality leads to less environmental protection and consequently higher emissions in an overlapping generations model with a majority elected representative.  The
author points to the anecdotal evidence that Scandinavian countries
are the most protective of their environment among the developed
countries, being as well the most egalitarian.  A different argument
is put forward by McAusland (2003) and Gassebner Name (2008). 
Both suggest that inequality may inﬂuence emissions through the
channel of factor ownership and voting.  According to McAusland
(2003), the relationship between income inequality and demand
for pollution policy depends on the level of ownership concentration
and openness to trade in countries.  Hence, empirical tests of the relationship between income inequality and environmental quality
are expected to yield ambiguous results.  The author suggests controlling for the source of income inequality in each country as well
as for the endogenous price effects of its pollution policy. 
Gassebner Name (2008) argue that, at least in richer countries, rising
income inequality is associated with accelerated industrial decline
(through increasing outsourcing of industrial production as well as
skill-biased technical change), which in turn reduces the political
power of industrial producers and workers, thereby reducing their ability to bloc measures to reduce pollution or emissions.  Extending this
line of argument, one could imagine that in poorer countries, the political clout of the rising industrial sector is rising as well, leading to less
environmental regulation, particularly when richer population groups
are associated with the rising industrial sector.  Thus this line of argument could predict a different correlation between income inequality
and emissions in poor and rich countries. 
While these studies generally suggest that increasing income inequality will increase emissions, a second group of studies predicts exactly the opposite.  Ravallion Name (2000) point out that in a simple
model where the marginal propensity to emit (MPE) varies with income, inequality measures enter the income-emission relationship, a
point also made by Heerink Name (2001).  In fact, they point out that
there will be a biased estimate in the income-emission relationship if income inequality is not included in the estimation.  There is considerable
evidence from micro studies in several countries that the MPE does indeed vary with the level of income, with most studies ﬁnding that the
MPE falls with income (see Holtz-Eakin and Selden, 1995; Heil and
Selden, 1999; Grunewald Name, 2012; Jakob Name, 2014; Serino and
Klasen, 2015).  This suggests that higher inequality reduces emissions. 
This would be ampliﬁed if, in poorer countries, higher inequality implies
that a large share of the population lives outside the carbon economy,
i. e.  they lack access to electricity and other forms of modern energy. 
For that subpopulation, the MPE might be close to zero, thus increasing
their share in the population would lower aggregate emissions. 4
Finally, the emulation theory, originally due to Veblen (1899), hypothesizes that in more unequal societies individuals in a given social
class tend to compare themselves with the members of the immediately
superior social class and emulate their consumption patterns.  In this
way, more unequal societies might have a higher propensity to consume more polluting intensive goods and services (such as big cars,
long-distance vacations, etc. ) that are associated to a higher MPE and
therefore to higher emissions in comparison to egalitarian societies. 
The marginal propensity to emit will be higher at all income levels. 
In summary, the theoretical literature is ambiguous about the sign of
the relationship between inequality and emissions that is conditioned
to a number of underlying assumptions, see also Cushing Name (2015)
and Berthe and Elie (2015).  In this respect, we aim to contribute with
a novel empirical approach to shed light on some of the above mentioned theories.  The contrasting theoretical arguments also suggest
that the relationship is probably heterogeneous across countries, leading to different levels of emissions across countries, as well as to differences in income and inequality elasticities.  In fact, some theories
suggest that high inequality is associated with more emissions in richer
countries, while the relationship might be reversed in poorer countries. 
For example, Gassebner Name (2008) relate rising inequality in rich
countries to industrial decline and reduction of political power of the industrial producers.  This implies limited inﬂuence to stop stringent environmental regulations demanded by consumers in rich countries.  Our
speciﬁcation below will enable us to examine a non-monotonic relationship, such as the one implied by their mechanism. 
<Middle> Data. 
We use an unbalanced panel data set with annual measurements
from 1980 to 2008, covering 158 countries.  The total number of observations is 3966.  This data set is much more extensive than those used
in the existing literature on the relationship between income inequality,
GDP, and carbon emissions.  The corner stone of our data set are the Gini
coefﬁcients from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database
(SWIID) by Solt (2009).  For the SWIID, a missing data algorithm was
used to ﬁll in the Gini measurements and to make the data from different sources comparable.  Solt (2009) differentiates between before and
after tax income inequality.  Many high income countries apply strong
redistributive policies, which lead to overall lower after-tax income inequality than before tax income inequality.  We use after-tax income inequality measure because we are interested in the effect of
redistributive policies, and want to account for those already in place. 
The data on carbon dioxide emissions are from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory data set, which covers emissions from fossil fuel, natural gas consumption, and cement manufacturing (Boden Name, 2012). 
This data set is widely used in the literature but faces two major shortcomings, see e.
