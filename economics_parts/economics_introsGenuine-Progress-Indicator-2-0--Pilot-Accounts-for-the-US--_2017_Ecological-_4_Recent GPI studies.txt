The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) remains one of the most ubiquitously applied alternatives to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in sustainable development research and policy settings.  Unlike GDP and
related measures that have a dubious connection to economic welfare,
the GPI attempts to measure it directly by accounting for the beneﬁts
of both market and nonmarket goods and services as well as the economic, social, and environmental costs of economic activity.  Pioneered
by Herman Daly and John Cobb in 1989, the basic structure and calculation methods for the GPI (known originally as the Index of Sustainable
Economic Welfare) have changed relatively little despite theoretical reﬁnements that have been suggested in recent literature and a proliferation of new methods and sources of data for many of the GPI's basic
adjustments. 
Recent GPI studies have been completed at multiple scales including
the world as a whole (Kubiszewski Name, 2013), at the country level for
Japan (Hayashi, 2015), Brazil (Andrade and Garcia, 2015) and Italy
(Armiento, 2016), at the state or province level for Liaoning Province
(Hou, 2016), Oregon (Kubiszewski Name, 2015), Hawaii (OstergaardKlem and Oleson, 2014), northeast Ohio (Bagstad and Shammin,
2012), Maryland (McGuire Name, 2012), Utah (Berik and Gaddis,
2014), Vermont (Erickson Name, 2013), Flanders (Bleys, 2013) and Tuscany (Pulselli Name, 2012) and at the city level for Baltimore (Posner and
Costanza, 2011.  Talberth and Weisdorf, 2014), Hong Kong (Delang and
Yu, 2015), Singapore (Delang and Yu, 2015) and a group of six cities in
China (Li Name, 2016).
