 1.  Introduction In a number of developing countries, biogas has been promoted as a renewable, cleaner and cheaper energy source, especially for cooking, as compared to alternatives such as ﬁrewood and kerosene.  For instance, countries such as China and India have a long history of promoting biogas.  However, it is only in the last twenty ﬁve years that household level biogas programmes, which promote construction of digesters or tanks which convert organic waste into biogas, have spread across the globe. 1 According to Rakotojaona (2013), N250,000 digesters have been installed in Nepal since 1992 and about 125,000 in Vietnam in 2003.  Other Asian countries with household biogas programmes include Cambodia and Bangladesh which launched their biogas programmes in 2006 and most recently, Pakistan and Indonesia in 2009. 2 In the Indonesian context, while a majority of the population has access to electricity for lighting, biomass, mainly wood, remains an important energy source for cooking (see Table 1).  At the national level, in 2011, for 40% of Indonesian households, ﬁrewood was their primary cooking fuel, while in East Java, 43% of households relied mainly on ﬁrewood for cooking and about 52% used liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG).  The substantial use of LPG is relatively new and is a consequence of the country's large-scale kerosene to LPG conversion programme (2007–2012) which was motivated by a desire to reduce the budgetary burden of the kerosene subsidy. 3 Despite the conversion programme and other reforms which have reduced the subsidy burden, the growth in energy demand combined with declining domestic production and an increase in fuel imports continues to ensure that subsidies for oil-based fuels remain a large burden on the budget (see Asian Development Bank, 2015.  International Institute for Sustainable Development,At the same time as attempting to reduce the subsidy burden through the conversion programme the government passed a number of decrees and acts which recognized the importance of promoting and developing alternative energy sources and technologies, both from an environmental and a budgetary perspective (see SNV, 2009).  Speciﬁcally, a presidential decree (No. 5/2006) on National Energy Policy released in January 2006 stated the government's goal of ensuring security of energy supply by reducing the share of oil-based fuels in the country's energy mix from 51% in 2006 to 20% in 2025, primarily by increasing the share of renewable energy.  Speciﬁcally with regard to biogas, mainly due to the widespread availability of ﬁrewood and heavy subsidies for kerosene, its use in Indonesia has been limited.  However, since 2005, following the reduction of kerosene subsidies and consistent with the National Energy Policy of reducing reliance on oil-based fuels, various institutions and organizations began developing activities to disseminate manure fed biogas digesters.  By the end of 2009, through ﬁfteen initiatives about 6000 digesters had been installed for domestic use (SNV, 2009).  To consolidate these scattered efforts and to boost the spread of biogas, in 2009, the Indonesian government launched a Household Biogas Program (Programme Biogas Rumah – BIRU).  The key objective of the programme was to install 8000 digesters by 2012 in rural dairy farming households located in eight provinces.  The focus of the program was on East Java.  The program operates through dairy cooperatives and is voluntary.  Dairy farmers who fulﬁl eligibility conditions such as ownership of at least two cows and who have an established record of delivering milk to a cooperative are offered a chance to purchase a digester.  An innovative aspect of the BIRU program is its co-operation with international companies, which makes it easier for dairy farmers to accessSimilar to biogas programs in other countries, the expectation is that the use of biogas will generate immediate beneﬁts by reducing the use of traditional fuels and energy-related expenditures, as well as lead to time-savings due to a reduction in time spent gathering wood.  Longer-term beneﬁts include enhanced agricultural productivity due to the use of bio-slurry, a by-product of biogas production which may be used as a fertiliser, improvements in indoor air quality and subsequent health beneﬁts.  Despite these expectations and the large number of initiatives in a number of Asian and African countries (see Rakotojaona, 2013.  Hessen, 2014), credible evidence on the actual impacts of such household biogas programs on short-term outcomes such as use of traditional fuels and energy-related expenditures as well on longer-term outcomes such as agricultural productivity and health outcomes is limited.  The bulk of the evidence is based on either before-after comparisons or single-period comparisons between households with and without a digester.  For instance, based on a before-after comparison of a sample of 461 biogas users in Nepal, Katuwal and Bohara (2009) report a 53% reduction in the use of ﬁrewood and an 81% reduction in the time spent collecting ﬁrewood.  Employing a similar approach but working with a sample of only 12 users, Garfí et al.  (2012) report a 50 to 60% reduction in the use of ﬁrewood.  Despite these effects, the lack of a control group hampers the credibility of the analysis.  Alternatively, based on single-period comparisons between 615 biogas users and 740 non-users drawn from 133 villages, a study of India's National Biogas Development Project (Program Evaluation Organisation, 2002) found that a majority of digesters (55%) were not operational.  Nevertheless, user households reduced their monthly consumption of ﬁrewood by 10 kg.  Based on data from three villages in Western China in 2006 (239 households.  183 users and 56 nonusers), Groenendaal and Gehua (2010) concluded that despite working with a sample of relatively long-term digester users the many beneﬁts attributed to the use of digesters had only partly been realized, if at all.  For most of the outcomes there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between users and non-users.  In both these studies the approach used to determine the control group was not clear and assessments were based on differences in means, without controlling for variables which might inﬂuence both uptake of digesters and outcomes. 5 A perhaps more rigorous assessment of the effect of a biogas initiative, Rwanda's National Domestic Biogas Program (NDBP), is provided by Bedi et al.  (2015).  While their study also uses cross-section data and compares outcomes for users and non-users, the non-users were selected from a list of “potential applicants” that is, those who had shown an interest in purchasing a digester and at the same time the non-users needed to fulﬁl the most important eligibility condition to become a user, that is, own at least two cows.  Their multivariate analysis showed that owning a digester was associated with a 31 to 32% reduction in annual energy expenditure and a ﬁve kilogram or 34% reduction in daily consumption of ﬁrewood.  At the same time they reported that about 10% of the supposedly completed digesters were producing no gas, and that the cost of installing a digester was prohibitive leading to a large gap between the number of digesters that were expected to be set up (15,000) and the number that were actually installed (1800).  The aim of this paper, which focuses on dairy farmers in East Java, is to examine the impact of Indonesia's Household Biogas Program (BIRU) on two main outcomes, that is, fuel use - whether access to digesters leads to reductions in the use of an oil-based fuel - liqueﬁed petroleum gas and the use of a traditional fuel - wood, and whether it leads to a decline in energy-related expenditure.  In order to assess the viability of the intervention we provide an exploratory payback analysis.  Methodologically, the paper extends the literature by using multiple evaluation strategies and providing estimates based on both crosssection and panel data.  In doing so, we attempt to place the literature on the effects of household biogas initiatives on a stronger empirical footing.  The paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 contains a description of the program.  Section 3 outlines the empirical approach, Section 4 lays out the sampling strategy and discusses the data and descriptive statistics.  Section 5 discusses the ﬁndings and presents a payback analysis while Section 6 concludes.  2.  Indonesia's household biogas program – Key features.  In 2008, the Government of Indonesia in co-operation with the Government of the Netherlands commissioned a feasibility study.  The study highlighted that the climatic conditions, especially high temperatures throughout the year and availability of water, provided a favourable environment for the production of biogas.  The report pegged the number of potential digesters users at more than one million dairy farming households in Java and Bali, where zero grazing is widely practised (SNV, 2009). 6 In 2009, as a consequence of the feasibility study, Indonesia launched a Household Biogas Program (BIRU). 7 BIRU's overall objective is to disseminate domestic digesters in order to create a local, sustainable energy alternative.  The program set itself a target of installing 8000 family sized (plant sizes of 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 m3) digesters in eight Indonesian provinces (East Java, DIY Yogyakarta, Central Java, West Java, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara, South Sulawesi and Lampung) by the end of 2012.  Although the programme had a slow start, it soon picked up momentum.  By May 2011 the target for 2011 had already been achieved, with over 2700 installed digesters and over 900 applicants awaiting construction of a digester.  By the end of 2012, it had met its target of disseminating about 8000 biogas digesters (see Table A. 1).  The BIRU program focuses mainly on East Java (62% of all digesters), followed by Lombok/Bali (17%), West Java (10%) and Central Java (9. 6%) (see Table A. 2).  BIRU carries out its work through intermediaries or so-called, Construction Partner Organizations (CPOs) and biogas supervisors.  Typically, the CPOs are co-operative organizations or local NGOs.  In Java, dairy co-operatives are key partners in the BIRU programme and help disseminate the biogas concept among dairy farmers.  The CPOs raise awareness about biogas among their members in their regular meetings or in special gatherings explicitly for the purpose of discussing this issue.  If members show interest, the CPO carries out a farm eligibility assessment, which is based on criteria such as having at least two cows, a positive cash ﬂow from milk revenues supplied to the cooperative, and a farmer's debt history.  In addition, the CPO veriﬁes whether the farm plot is large enough to install a digester.  If a farmer qualiﬁes, ﬁnancial arrangements are negotiated with the help of the CPO, and subsequently masons trained by BIRU are deployed to construct the digesters. 8 After the digester has been installed, the mason ﬁles a completion report, and BIRU carries out quality control checks.  BIRU trains dairy farmers on the proper usage of digesters.  They receive a user manual and a mason is present during initial plant feeding.  BIRU guarantees an after sale service of two years. 9 Depending on the size, the cost of a digester lies between €450 and €700.  Regardless of the digester size, BIRU provides a ﬂat subsidy of €160 (Table 2).  The remainder is paid by the farmer, usually through a loan obtained from credit schemes offered by the cooperative.  The repayment instalments are ﬁnanced by deductions from payments the farmer receives for the delivery of milk.  Interest rates differ across cooperatives, depending on the source of the loan.  A range of partners have made resources available for the credit schemes, and while there are no interest charges on 2 to 3 year loans provided by Nestlé, an international food company, other partners such as Rabobank or Bank Syariah Mandiri (BSM) charge interest rates of 8 to 11% with repayment periods of 3 to 5 years.  <Middle> Identifying the impact of digesters.  Our main aim is to identify the extent to which changes in the main outcomes of interest - in this case, fuel use and energy expenditure may be attributed to the BIRU programme.  To identify these effects, the evaluation relies on both cross-section and panel data and a comparison between farm households with (treatment group) and without (control group) a digester.  There are two main empirical concerns with regard to attribution.  First, the program is voluntary and households need to take the initiative to apply for a digester and second, conditional on application, program beneﬁciaries are not selected at random but need to fulﬁl eligibility conditions such as ownership of at least two cows and a regular record of delivering milk to a cooperative.  Due to these two aspects – self-selection into the program and the imposition of eligibility conditions – it is quite likely that those who apply and obtain a digester are systematically different from those who do not.  Hence, comparisons between households who have a digester and those who don't, without accounting for potential differences in factors that determine selection into the program are unlikely to yield credible estimates. 10 To account for the challenges highlighted in the preceding paragraph and to deliver credible estimates, the study relies on two different evaluation approaches, that is, difference-in-differences (DID) estimation and a pipeline comparison design, both of which we combine with propensity score matching (PSM).  For the DID analysis we rely on baseline (2011) and follow-up (2012) data on the same set of dairy farmers.  We compare outcomes for farming households (h) who acquired a digester through BIRU between baseline and follow-up with outcomes for farming households (h) who did not obtain a digester between 2011 and 2012.  The differences in outcomes (yht), over time (t), that is, between baseline and follow-up and between BIRU participants (D2012=1) and non-participants (D2012=0), may be interpreted as the causal effect of the BIRU biogas digesters.  The DID estimates may be written as this.  The causal interpretation is based on the (parallel trends) assumption that changes in outcomes recorded for the control group are similar to the changes in outcomes that would have been observed for the BIRU participants had they not had a biogas digester installed.  By comparing differences in trends across treatment and control groups, rather than differences in levels, this approach eliminates time-invariant unobserved differences such as the latent ability and productivity of farmers which may have a bearing on digester uptake and outcomes.  In order to enhance the credibility of the basic DID analysis and to ensure comparability of the treatment and control group in terms of observed characteristics we combine the basic DID analysis with propensity score matching.  Using this approach, each unit in the participant group is matched to an observationally similar unit from the non-participant group.  This procedure implies that the control group is re-weighted such that it appears identical to the treatment group in terms of observed characteristics.  Subsequently, DID analysis/pipeline comparison is conducted on the treated units and the matched controls. 11 While the combination of PSM and DID allows us to control for differences in observed characteristics between the treatment and control groups as well as to control for time-invariant differences in unobserved characteristics that may be correlated with programme uptake and outcomes, the credibility of the estimates is based on the validity of the parallel trends assumption.  The main threat to this assumption is if participation in – or targeting of – the BIRU program is determined by shocks to the outcome variables (for example, poverty and social safety net programs), or if inherent unobserved differences between treatment and control groups induce different outcome trajectories in the absence of the program.  There are several reasons why the nature of the BIRU program is likely to reduce these threats.  First, participation in the BIRU program is not driven by shocks or unexpected events.  Rather, these are long-term investment decisions by farm households, with assistance from BIRU CPOs.  Second, the analysis focuses on a relatively homogeneous group of farmers who operate in a similar production and institutional context and it is unlikely that time-varying shocks have different effects on outcomes across the treatment and control group.  Nevertheless, in addition to the difference-in-difference analysis we also consider a cross-section based pipeline comparison approach.  This method exploits a particular feature of the BIRU program, which is that the program was rolled out gradually over a 4-year period.  This means that during the baseline survey, some farmers without a digester had already applied for a digester and were awaiting delivery.  That is, in 2011 they were in the pipeline to be treated in 2012.  These farmers can be readily identiﬁed in the survey waves as the new users of biogas digesters in 2012.  To implement the pipeline evaluation design we use these digester applicants or future users as a control group in the baseline year and compare them with farmers that were already participating in the BIRU program in 2011.  The pipeline comparison estimates may be written as this.  This approach addresses potential bias due to eligibility or selfselection as both the groups have shown a desire to purchase a digester.  In addition, this approach does not rely on the parallel trends assumption.  However, the cross-sectional pipeline comparison introduces other problems.  For example, there may be systematic differences between early and late adopters of an innovative technology, a problem that difference-in-difference analysis can deal with more effectively.  Thus, while this approach is not a substitute for the difference-indifference analysis, it does provide an alternative evaluation methodology that allows us to evaluate the robustness of the results.  Similar to the difference-in-difference analysis, we combine the cross-section based pipeline comparison approach with propensity score matching in order to enhance comparability of the treatment and control groups.  To enhance clarity, Table 3 summarises the choice of treatment and control groups for the different evaluation strategies.  For the differencein-difference evaluation, two groups of households are compared.  First, the treatment group consists of households that did not have a biogas digester in 2011 but did have one in 2012.  We refer to them as new users in the subsequent sections.  Second, the control group consists of farm households with comparable features (e. g.  members of a cooperative, reside in the same villages, same number of productive cows) but those who have never obtained a biogas digester.  We refer to them as never users in the following.  For the cross-sectional pipeline comparison approach, a second treatment group is deﬁned as consisting of households who were already using biogas digesters, whom we refer to as always users.  In this approach, the new users (i. e. , the ﬁrst treatment group) serve as a cross-sectional control group.  4.  Sampling strategy and the data.  4. 1.  Sampling.  The evaluation is based on two survey rounds of the same households conducted in May-June 2011 and May-June 2012 in East Java province.  In addition, qualitative information was acquired using focus group discussions and key informant interviews.  East Java was chosen as at the time of the ﬁrst survey it contained N75% of the digesters installed through the BIRU program.  In 2011, the BIRU program was active in 9 rural districts in East Java and involved 11 CPOs.  Given budgetary considerations the overall sample size was set at 700 households, consisting of 250 applicants (new users), 350 nonapplicant households (the potential never users) and 100 households with a digester (always users). 12 Dairy farmers participating in the CPOs/cooperatives covered by the BIRU program form the natural sampling frame from which to draw treatment and control groups.  Accordingly the ﬁrst step in the sampling procedure involved the selection of CPOs to be included in the survey.  Two CPOs were dropped as they only had a small number of installed digesters which left us with 9 CPOs.  In the second step we obtained a list of applicants, non-applicants and current users from each of the 9 CPOs.  The list included 497 applicants, 18,321 non-applicants who satisﬁed certain conditions and 2086 current users.  We began by drawing a random sample of 250 applicants.  The distribution of the sample across CPOs was based on the relative share of the applicants in each CPO.  Turning to the nonapplicants, in order to serve as suitable controls, non-applicants had to comply with three conditions.  They had to have at least one productive cow, had to regularly supply milk to the cooperative and should not already own a digester provided through a different program.  From the set of 18,321 potential controls, 344 were randomly selected.  Finally, 101 users were randomly drawn from the set of existing users.  In the case of both non-applicants and existing users, the distribution of the sample across each CPO was proportional to the underlying distribution of the population. 13 A total of 695 households were surveyed at baseline.  In 2012, we attempted to survey the same households.  We were unable to locate 18 households at follow-up.  Our statistical assessment shows that there is no systematic difference between those who remained in the sample and those who dropped out. 14 A potentially more serious sampling problem is non-compliance with user status.  After accounting for attrition, of the 245 applicants who were expected to obtain digesters in 2012, 61 had their applications rejected by BIRU and remained in the never user category.  At the same time, of the 335 individuals who were designated as controls in 2011 and surveyed again in 2012, 32 secured a digester between the baseline and followup period.  We have assigned these non-compliers to the groups we ﬁnd them in 2012, that is, 97 always users, 216 new users and 364 never-users (Table 4).  In the case of the pipeline comparison design which is based on comparing always users with applicants the analysis focuses on the 97 always users and the 216 new users who were either applicants (184) or part of the control group (32) in 2011.  Since the always users and the new users have both been accepted by the BIRU programme, it may be argued that dropping the non-eligible applicants and focusing on always users and new users (who displayed an interest and have been deemed eligible) enhances the credibility of the pipeline comparison design.  With regard to the difference-in-difference analyses, the focus is on comparing never users and new users.  Since we have panel data and can control for time-invariant observed and unobserved traits which may be associated with programme entry (obtaining a digester) there is no reason to expect that non-compliance compromises the analysis. 15 When we compare the 2011 baseline data with the nationally representative Indonesian socioeconomic household survey of 2011, we ﬁnd that average annual per capita spending by the sampled dairy farm households is similar to average spending by Indonesian households in East Java who are engaged in the livestock sector.  On average, the dairy farmers in the sample sit between decile 4 and decile 5 of the national per capita expenditure distribution (Table A. 7).  Proﬁles of the interviewed households are provided in Table 5.  The average household size is about 4 members.  The majority of the households are headed by a male (97%) with an average age of about 46 years.  Dairy farming is the main professional activity (88% of the household heads).  For a third of the sample, primary school is the highest level of education completed by any household member, while for another third of the sample, the highest level of education is junior secondary.  Access to electricity is relatively high, with almost 90% of the households reporting access.  The average size of a farm is 0. 6 acres, just under a quarter of the households own the land they cultivate, and on average they own about 5 cows.  About 92% of the interviewed households have 2 or more cows, which represents the minimum requirement for joining most of the cooperatives in the surveyed area, and is also the recommended minimum for operating a digester.  There are some differences between the two treatment groups (new users and always users) and the households without a digester (never users) which we need to take into account in the impact evaluation.  Farms with a biogas digester, and especially the early adopters, have on average larger farms, more cows and are more likely to own their farm land.  They also have higher levels of education than new and never users, while the latter two groups have comparable education levels.  On average, houses owned by always users have more rooms and are of better quality (in terms of materials used for the walls, ﬂoor, roof and windows).  To examine whether the three groups are similar in terms of the probability of owning a digester we estimate logit models of digester ownership as a function of various socio-demographic characteristics.  Few variables are statistically signiﬁcant and the models have limited explanatory power and especially in the case of the pipeline comparison design sample the model (overall p-value 0. 14) is not able to discriminate very clearly between the always users and the new users.  In other words the two groups appear to be similar in terms of the probability of owning a digester (see Table A. 8).  While differences in the probability of owning a digester may be limited the descriptive statistics do show that wealthier and better educated farmers are more likely to adopt biogas digesters.  In the empirical analysis we rely on propensity score matching to ensure that the three groups are observationally equivalent in terms of the traits that determine ownership of a digester.  5.  Financing, functioning and impact of digesters.  As a prelude to examining the impact of biogas digesters, this section provides details on the ﬁnancing and functioning of digesters.  Thereafter, we discuss the econometric estimates.  fully-constructed and functioning digester is 4 months or less.  The bulk of the digesters (93%) are ﬁnanced entirely through loans/credit offered at zero interest and payable over two to three years.  The main source of credit as far as households are concerned is the cooperative to which they belong.  This is a little misleading as almost all the cooperatives that are included in the survey sell their milk to Nestlé which in turn provides loans to cooperatives at 0% interest rate in order to enable digester purchases.  The terms of re-payment differ across cooperatives but the amounts are deducted periodically (usually every 10 to 12 days) and automatically from the money owed by the cooperative to the individual member for milk sales.  While most farmers (75%) were unable to provide information on the outstanding loans, they did have records on the total proceeds from milk sales, the deduction for repayment of the digester loan and the outstanding loan balance.  None of the respondents expressed concerns about the repayment burden.  About half the households in our sample have a 6m3 digester followed by 38% who have a 10 m3 plant.  Almost all the households (96%) reported that their digester was functioning as expected and enough gas was being produced.  Prior to purchase, the three main reasons stated by respondents for buying a digester were reduced need for ﬁrewood (44%), faster cooking (33%) and a smokeless kitchen (26%).  Other reasons were improvements in barn hygiene, less time needed to procure energy and use of bio slurry.  Ex post, N90% mentioned that they had experienced these beneﬁts. 16 In terms of overall levels of satisfaction, 47% of the respondents reported that they were “very satisﬁed” with their digester while 52% reported that they were “rather satisﬁed” and only 1% of the treated households stated that they were “rather unsatisﬁed”.  Consistent with the satisfactory remarks on gas production, there were limited complaints on the need for ﬁxing or replacing digester parts.  About 6% of digester owners reported that they have had to repair or replace parts since their digesters ﬁrst became operational while about 3% had experienced unexpected effects such as a bad smell due to gas leaks, a non-working stove or problems with the thermometer.  In addition to construction of the digester, the availability of water and cow dung is crucial for the proper functioning of digesters and ensuring adequate gas ﬂow.  Table 6 compares the actual distribution of digesters by capacity and cow ownership to the recommended cow holding per digester size (in parentheses).  About 44% of digester owning households do not have the recommended cow to digester size ratio, indicating that gas production could be hampered by insufﬁcient fuel.  This is most prominent among the new users, where about half the farms have less than the recommended number of cows as compared to a third of the always users.  In terms of water availability, only 8% of the treated households stated that they faced water shortages.  Notwithstanding the gap between recommended and actual ratios it does not seem that this aspect has a negative effect on household perceptions of gas production.  5. 1.  Financing and functioning.  The process to obtain a digester seems to run efﬁciently, as in 90% of the cases the time between submitting an application form and having a fully-constructed and functioning digester is 4 months or less.  The bulk of the digesters (93%) are financed entirely through loans/credit offered at zero interest and payable over two to three years.  The main source of credit as far as households are concerned is the cooperative to which they belong.  This is a little misleading as almost all the cooperatives that are included in the survey sell theirmilk to Nestléwhich in turn provides loans to cooperatives at 0% interest rate in order to enable digester purchases.  The terms of re-payment differ across cooperatives but the amounts are deducted periodically (usually every 10 to 12 days) and automatically from the money owed by the cooperative to the individual member for milk sales.
