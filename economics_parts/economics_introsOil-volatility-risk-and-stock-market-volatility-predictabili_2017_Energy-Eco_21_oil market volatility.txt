A long strand of literature suggests the great importance of
commodities' predictive power to stock market, in which few, if any,
other commodities have received more attention for their perceived
economic signiﬁcance than oil.  Theoretically and empirically, the critical
role of oil market for understanding macroeconomic ﬂuctuations has
been well documented (see, for example, Hamilton, 1983, 2005. 
Backus and Crucini, 2000.  Kilian and Park, 2009.  Bodenstein etal. ,
2011.  Alquist etal. , forthcoming).  Among various oil market variables,
oil shock is a noteworthy one as there are voluminous studies, for
instance, on the short and long-runco-movements and causation relationships between oil shocks and stock volatility (see, e. g. ,Arouri etal. ,
2011, 2012.  Creti etal. , 2013.  Conrad etal. , 2014.  Du and He, 2015. 
Kang etal. , 2015.  Ewing and Malik, 2016).  It is, therefore, of interest to
deeply investigate the effect of oil market volatility on stock markets. 
However, not much has been done on the subject of predictive ability of oil to stock volatility from an out-of-sample perspective.
