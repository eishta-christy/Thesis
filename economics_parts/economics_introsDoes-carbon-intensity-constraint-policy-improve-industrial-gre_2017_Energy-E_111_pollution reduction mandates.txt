In recent decades, the phenomenon of global warming caused by
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become extremely serious,
resulting in more frequent and intense extreme weather and natural disasters.  As well known, the carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption are the nuclear source of the GHG emissions.  Therefore, mitigating
carbon emissions has become a global assignment to realize low carbon
sustainable development.  In response to climate change, many countries have reached basic agreements on mitigating carbon emissions. 
The Paris Climate Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol show the world's determination to cope with climate change issue.  As the largest developing country and the largest carbon emitter, China enacted the energy
intensity target policy and a series of binding policies during the 11th
“Five-Year Plan” (FYP) (2006–2010) and achieved a success in energy
saving and energy intensity reduction (Cao and Karplus, 2014.  Fujii
Name, 2016).  In 2009, China has ofﬁcially raised the carbon intensity
constraint target that carbon emissions per GDP (i. e. , carbon intensity)
would be reduced by 40%–45% in 2020 than the 2005 level.  Such a target
has been considered in the mid-long term plans of the national economic and social development. 
In 2011, China's 12th FYP explicitly proposed a sub-target of the CICP
that carbon emissions per GDP would drop by 17% in than that in 2010. 
This is the ﬁrst time for China to propose carbon intensity constraint target in the FYP.  Subsequently, the Chinese central government allocated
the carbon intensity reduction task to each provincial region, and stipulated that such a task must be incorporated into the local economic and
social development plans.  Thus, the carbon intensity reduction target
must be reﬂected in the performance assessment of the local government.  To fulﬁl such a target, the Chinese central government and local
governments have formulated a series of relevant supporting policies
and measures, and have carried out a “lasting battle” strategy for energy
saving and carbon reduction.  They have released a serious of documents
to declare that the government should endeavor to expedite industrial
structure adjustment, support energy conservation and the development of low carbon energy, increase carbon sinks, control non-energyrelated GHG emissions, and facilitate the substitution of high carbon
productions. 
China's industrial sector is not only a crucial engine of economic
growth, but also responsible for the largest share of the country's energy
consumption and carbon emissions.  The decline of carbon intensity in
the industrial sector plays a decisive role in achieving the overall carbon
intensity reduction target.  As a vital part of carbon reduction polices, a
number of speciﬁc measures focused on carbon reduction in the industrial sector, mainly including 6 aspects as follows.  (1) In 2009, the Chinese government ofﬁcially introduced the Standard for Sector-integrate
Eco-industrial Parks, standardizing the construction, management, and
assessment of sector-integrate eco-industrial parks.  In the same year,
for the enterprises in the eco-industrial parks, the speciﬁc requirements
for promoting the development of low carbon economy were put forward.  (2) In 2010, the Chinese government published a list of enterprises in 18 industrial sub-sectors (especially energy-intensive
industries), targeted at eliminating the backward production capacity. 
(3) China conducted a national resource tax reform for oil and gas in
2011, shifting from a volume-based tax to an ad valorem tax with a
tax rate of 5%–10% (Shi Name, 2015).  The resource tax reform on coal,
rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum followed the reform of the oil
and gas tax.  Compared with the volume-based resource tax system,
the tax rate in proportion to the market price will increase the costs of
resource use in the overheated market (Liu Name, 2017), which is beneﬁcial for energy conservation and carbon reduction.  (4) The 12th FiveYear Plan for Energy Saving and Emission Reduction stipulated the direction of restructuring the key industries, and promoted mergers and acquisitions in eight major industries, such as automobiles, steel, and
cement.  (5) The 12th Five-Year Plan for Energy Saving and Emission Reduction speciﬁed the targets and assignment of energy conservation
for the energy-intensive industrial sectors.  (6) In 2011, the Chinese government issued a catalogue of industrial restructuring guidance to limit
the expansion of some industries, such as coal, petrochemical and
chemical industries. 
The speciﬁc measures in the industrial sector contribute to industrial
carbon reduction.  However, under the ongoing tightening pressure of
carbon reduction, some provinces begin to implement some administrative mandatory measures like power rationing,1 attempting to
achieve the energy-saving and emission-reduction targets in a shortterm by the way of limiting enterprises' production.  The central government also continues to give pressure to the key industries and enterprises, in order to realize the emission-reduction targets.  Obviously,
whether or not the CICP can achieve the “double dividend” of carbon reduction and industrial growth is signiﬁcant for achieving China's
low carbon sustainable development, because industrial sector is the
biggest emitter, as well as the important engine of economic growth. 
Moreover, in 2015, China submitted its intended nationally determined
contribution (INDC) and released its pledge in GHG reduction.  This
brings a new challenge for China to integrate climate change mitigation
into other national priorities.  The investigation on the effects of the CICP
can provide necessary decision-making reference for coordinating carbon reduction with economic development.  However, the implementation effect of China's CICP on such a “double dividend” goal is paid little
attention to in previous studies. 
The appropriate measure of sustainable growth is necessary for
assessing whether or not the CICP is effective to coordinate industrial
growth and carbon reduction.  The green production performancethe environmentally sensitive productivity growth
encompassing undesirable output(s), is usually employed by the
existing studies to reﬂect green accounting or sustainable development
(Kumar, 2006.  Oh, 2010.  Chen and Golley, 2014).  Since improving the
GPP means a better coordination state of industrial growth and carbon
reduction, the investigation of the effects of the CICP on the industrial
GPP can provide the competent evidence in whether such a policy is actually beneﬁcial to the sustainable development of a certain country. 
Actually, although the gross industrial carbon emissions in China
have been increasing, the industrial carbon intensity has been decreasing year by year during 2001–2013 (see Fig.  1).  In terms of a single indicator of industrial carbon intensity, China's CICP in recent years seemed
to be successful, and the environmental policy aiming at the industrial
sector is not as inefﬁcient as some studies mentioned (e. g.  Zheng
Name, 2015).  However, the decrease of carbon intensity is only a direct
result of the implementation of the CICP, and the impact of such a policy
on the industrial GPP is still covered.  Theoretically, from the perspective
of microeconomics, the CICP affects the industrial GPP in two aspects.  On
the one hand, as an environmental regulation policy, a reasonable CICP
can promote energy saving and low carbon production by improving
the allocation of input factors (Li Name, 2013).  On the other hand, the
carbon constraint target force the enterprises to increase innovation investment, ameliorate technological progress, and improve energy efﬁciency (Xuan and Zhou, 2011), in order to facilitate carbon reduction
and productivity growth.  In this case, the industrial GPP can be enhanced even when industrial output scale remains unchanged.  Despite
some theoretical arguments, the impact of China's CICP on the industrial
GPP has not yet been empirically explored. 
In an attempt to ﬁll such a gap, this paper employs the quasi
difference-in-differences (quasi-DID) method to investigate the effect
of the CICP on China's industrial GPP for the ﬁrst time.  The industrial
GPP is estimated based on the framework of nonparametric data envelope analysis (DEA), which is widely used in the existing literature to assess the environmentally sensitive productivity growth.  The directional
distance function (DDF) is an alternative approach to measuring the
productivity growth considering the undesirable output.  The original
DDF is regarded as an oriented and radial measure with some limitations (Fukuyama and Weber, 2009.  Zhang and Choi, 2014), and the infeasible problem of linear programming could distort the productivity
growth level.  For the purpose of avoiding the biases caused by the radial
and oriented DDF and the infeasible problem, this paper combines the
global benchmark technology (Oh, 2010) and the non-radial and nonoriented DDF (NNDDF) (Zhou Name, 2012) to measure the industrial
GPP of China. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows (see Fig.  2). 
Section 2 provides an overview of the related literature.  Section 3 introduces the used data and methodology, including the estimation models
of industrial GPP and the quasi-DID model for investigating the effect of
the CICP on industrial GPP.  In Section 4, we report and discuss the estimation results of the industrial GPP and quasi-DID model.  Section 5
draws main conclusions and provides some policy implications. 
2.  Literature review. 
2. 1.  Measurement of the GPP. 
Among the methodologies of measuring the GPP, i. e. , the environmentally sensitive productivity growth, the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index (ML index), which is proposed by Chung Name (1997)
and integrates the concepts of the Malmquist productivity index and
DDF, has been widely applied in the previous studies (Färe Name,
2001.  Yoruk and Zaim, 2005.  Kumar, 2006.  Zhou Name, 2010.  Arabi
Name, 2014).  However, the ML index method encounters three shortcomings.  Firstly, since the ML index employs the contemporaneous
benchmark technology, and thus faces a potential infeasible problem
when calculating intertemporal DDF (Oh, 2010).  Secondly, the conventional DDF, the basis of the ML index, is a radial and oriented measure
method that may overestimate the efﬁciency when there is some slacks
(Fukuyama and Weber, 2009).  Meanwhile, if researcher focuses on the
total factor productivity index, non-oriented DDF rather than outputoriented model is more appropriate (Zhang and Choi, 2014).  Thirdly,
the ML index is not circular as it employs geometric mean to avoid
choosing an arbitrary benchmark (Oh, 2010). 
In view of such defects, some studies develop several novel
methods.  Based on the global benchmark technology, the GML (global
Malmquist-Luenberger) index is proposed by Oh (2010) in order to
completely overcome the potential infeasible problem.  Since the
intertemporal DDF is formulated based on a single technology frontier,
i. e. , the global benchmark technology, there is no need to employ geometric mean to avoid choosing an arbitrary benchmark when calculating the total factor productivity growth.  This makes the GML index
circular.  Because of such an advantage, the GML index method is applied
by a lot of studies (e. g. , Azad and Ancev, 2014.  Fan Name, 2015.  Zhang
and Wang, 2015).  However, the GML index has the shortcomings of radial and oriented measure methods.  For remedying the bias of the radial
and oriented measure methods, Fukuyama and Weber (2009) and Färe
and Grosskopf (2010a, 2010b) developed the NNDDF, which was later
extended by Chang and Hu (2010), Barros Name (2012), Zhou Name
(2012), Zhang Name (2013), and Arabi Name (2014) to establish the efﬁciency measure model incorporating undesirable outputs.  Among such
studies, Zhou Name (2012) made an important contribution by providing
a formal deﬁnition and the mathematical properties of the NNDDF considering undesirable outputs. 
To avoid the bias caused by the infeasible problem and taking into
account the disadvantages and advantages of various efﬁciency measure methods based on the DEA framework, we incorporate the global
benchmark technology (Oh, 2010) and the NNDDF (Zhou Name, 2012)
into a uniform measure model and adopt the Luenberger indicator
which is more consistent with the characteristics of the NNDDF to evaluate the GPP of China's industrial sub-sectors. 
2. 2.  DID method in the environmental policy assessment. 
With regard to the method of assessing the impact of a certain policy, the difference-in-differences (DID) method is widely used in the
existing literature (Gruber and Poterba, 1994.  Feldstein, 1995.  Eissa,
1995.  Cai Name, 2016).  The DID usually divides the samples into the
treatment group and the control group, and evaluates the effect of policy implementation by comparing the differences between the treatment group and the control group before and after the policy
intervention.  Because most policy interventions regarded as natural experiments are exogenously given, the DID method can avoid an endogenous problem.  Some studies have applied the DID to explore the effects
of various environmental policies.  Bao Name (2013) examined the actual
effect of local environmental legislation by using the DID method and
found that the environmental protection legislation per se in China
could not signiﬁcantly inhibit the local pollutant emissions, and only
in the provinces with strict law enforcement and serious pollution, the
environmental protection legislation could play a signiﬁcant environmental improvement effect.  Li and Chen (2013) explored the effect of
the revision of the Air Pollution Prevention Law in China and argued
that such a policy intervention signiﬁcantly improved the total factor
productivity of the sectors with intensive air pollution.  They asserted
that the implementation of appropriate environmental regulation
policy in China may achieve a “win-win” outcome of improving environmental quality and economic productivity.  Recently, Cai Name
(2016) investigated regional unanticipated responses to the
pollution reduction mandates imposed by China's central government in 2001 and concluded that the enforcement of pollution
discharge fee collection is more lenient in most downstream
counties within a province, and that private enterprises make more
contributes to such a downstream effect than state-owned and foreign ones. 
As mentioned above, although the CICP proposed in 2009 is a signiﬁcant measure of controlling carbon emissions in China, the
existing related studies pay little attention to the effect of such a carbon regulation policy on the GPP.
