Many countries subsidise the production and consumption of fossil
fuels.  Most subsidies are given downstream, to reduce the cost of consuming fossil fuels (Coady Name, 2016).  While these subsidies beneﬁt
fuel consumers, at least in the short run, they also have a number of
negative effects (IEA, 2014).  First, they contribute to ﬁscal imbalances
and thus crowd out other government spending.  Second, subsidies
stimulate excessive fossil fuel consumption contributing to increased
emissions of harmful pollution such as CO2.  Finally, in the long run
low oil prices encourage the development of energy-intensive industries and discourage development of renewable technologies.  Despite
the negative effects, it has proven difﬁcult to remove fossil fuel subsidies.  In many countries fossil fuel subsidies were originally introduced
to improve consumer welfare, and proposals to remove such subsidies
could result in citizen protests.  We ﬁnd, however, that the biggest
subsidisers may increase their welfare by removing their oil subsidies. 
The reason is that subsidy removal allows these countries to shift oil
from the domestic market to the international market where prices
are higher. 
The biggest fossil fuel subsidisers are also major producers and exporters of oil and gas.  In fact, the heaviest fossil fuel subsidisers are the
OPEC countries, mostly located in the Middle-East and North-Africa
(MENA) region.
