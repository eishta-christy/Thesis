 1.  Introduction In order to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), policies could either attempt to reduce the proﬁtability of agriculture, e. g.  by removing agricultural subsidies, or offer positive incentives such as payment for environmental services (PES) that aim to put a price on forest externalities (Angelsen, 2010.  Palmer, 2011).  The latter have come to dominate both project and nascent jurisdictional-scale REDD+ strategies (see e. g.  Mahanty et al. , 2013.  Sills et al. , 2014).  Acre State in Brazil, the setting for our paper, is currently at the forefront of efforts to institutionalize jurisdictional-scale REDD+.  At an estimated cost of US$260 million, the State government's objective is to reduce deforestation by 80% by 2020, thus conserving 5. 5 million ha of forest in order to prevent the release of 62. 5 Mt of CO2 emissions (Herbert, 2010).  To this end, Acre has established a ‘PES-like’ scheme known as the Incentive System for Environmental Services (SISA) framework.  Its objective is to internalize values associated with forest carbon, as well as biodiversity and hydrological services, by incentivizing landowners to conserve forest on their landholdings.  In this paper, we model a hypothetical SISA payment in order to address two related questions.  First, given the extent of uncertainty in land-use returns from forest conversion, what is the minimum level of payment that Acre's government should pay to landowners to ensure forest conservation with a 90% probability.  Reﬂecting the common practice of Latin American incentive payment schemes, our payment is held constant over time.  The ‘90% probability’ is illustrative of a setting in which there is a relatively strong commitment on the part of the policymaker to enforce conservation contracts and hence, keep land in forest.
