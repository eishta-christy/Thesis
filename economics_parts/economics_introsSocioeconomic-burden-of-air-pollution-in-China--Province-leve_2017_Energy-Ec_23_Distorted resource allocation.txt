 1.  Introduction China’s excess air pollution is widely known.  In 2014, for example, annual ﬁne particulate (PM2. 5) levels in 31 Chinese major cities (4 province-level cities and 27 provincial capitals) were 23-124 μg/m3, with a mean of 65 μg/m3, exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline level of 10 μg/m3 by a factor of N6 (Nam, forthcoming).  As demonstrated by a substantial body of the epidemiological literature, conventional air pollutants, such as PM2. 5, increase health risks substantially (Dockery et al. , 1989, 1992.  Dockery and Pope, 1994).  Given its excessiveness, air pollution in China has posed enormous and imminent threats to the public health of urban residents.  Many impact studies motivated to increase public awareness of the threats have used such epidemiological evidence to estimate pollution-induced socioeconomic burdens.  A conventional approach ﬁrst keeps track of the morbidity and mortality cases that occur due to exposure to excess pollution, applying concentration-response functions, drawn from the epidemiological literature, to given pollution levels.  Each case is then valuated in monetary terms, using market or surveyed data for each health endpoint.  A substantial number of China-focused studies have adopted this approach, and their estimated pollution-health costs range from 3. 5 to 5. 9% of China’s historic gross domestic product (GDP) (see Section 4. 2).  One potential problem in the literature is a lack of dynamic thinking in economic valuation.  Many available estimates for China are based on a static application of the conventional approach mentioned above, considering only a single point in time.  However, the effects of pollutioncaused damage may remain in an economy for a long time (Nam et al. , 2010).  Labor loss in one period, for example, reduces incomes and savings, which will then lead to less investment and growth in the future.  Also, increased demand for medical services can hardly be met without drawing resources from other sectors, distorting cross-industry resource allocation.  Distorted resource allocation due to an external shock (i. e.
