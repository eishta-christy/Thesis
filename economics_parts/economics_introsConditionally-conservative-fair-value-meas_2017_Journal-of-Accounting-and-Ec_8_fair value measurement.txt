 Introduction We investigate whether firms' recurring measurements of the fair values of recognized financial instruments (hereafter “fair value measurements”) exhibit conditional conservatism when the instruments do not trade in liquid markets, thereby enabling them to exercise discretion over the measurements. 1 Absent such discretion, fair value measurements should be unbiased, i. e. , symmetrically incorporate unrealized gains and unrealized losses.  Policymakers and academics often make statements or research design choices that suggest fair value measurements generally are unbiased, ignoring biases introduced by discretion.  For example, SEC (2008) states that the “objective of SFAS No.  157 and of existing fair value standards is to provide transparent unbiased information about fair value. ” Shaffer (2011) describes fair value measurement as “an anchor for”…“an asset/liability approach… [in which] valuations must be objective and neutral.  This requirement overrides the constraint of conservatism, which historically assumed a downward bias for asset valuations.
