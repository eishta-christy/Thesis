 
The information contained in earnings announcements plays an important role in the determination of stock prices.  
Despite its importance, numerous studies show that stock prices do not immediately and fully incorporate all of the information in earnings announcements and that various accounting-based measures and ﬁnancial statement components have 
the ability to predict future stock prices.  Among the reasons offered for these apparent ineﬃciencies are limits on investor 
attention, which lead investors to focus on subsets of information, and investors’ inability to fully understand the complexities of the information contained in earnings reports (e. g. , Bartov Name, 20 0 0 ; Hirshleifer Name, 2011 ; Doyle Name, 2006 ; 
DellaVigna and Pollet, 2009 ; You and Zhang, 2009 ).  
Prior research has shown that bond prices, like stock prices, react to earnings news.  
This literature, though, does not examine whether corporate bonds incorporate earnings news more eﬃciently than stocks.  The reason why they might is that 
the bond market is more heavily dominated by sophisticated investors than is the stock market ( Bessembinder Name, 2009 ; 
De Franco Name, 2009 ; Ronen and Zhou, 2013 ).  These investors have greater resources at their disposal to analyze earnings 
reports and are arguably less constrained than are individual investors by either limited attention or diﬃculties in interpreting the information in earnings announcements.  This is supported by Bartov Name (20 0 0) and Doyle Name (2006) who 
show that greater sophisticated investor presence enhances the ability of share prices to quickly incorporate the information 
contained in earnings announcements and to mitigate the post-earnings announcement drift.  Consistent with this, Campbell 
Name (2009) show that institutions trade aggressively to exploit the post-earnings announcement drift.  These results suggest 
that if sophisticated investors are more dominant in the bond market than in the stock market, then earnings news would 
be incorporated more quickly into bond prices than into stock prices.  Consequently, the bond price reaction to earnings 
announcements would, similar to a number of accounting-based measures, have predictive power for future stock returns.  
Counterbalancing this is the fact that bonds are typically less liquid and less actively traded than stocks.  
Lower levels of liquidity could lead to an increase in the cost of trading and a reduction in the speed with which sophisticated bond 
investors trade to their new positions, reducing the relative eﬃciency of the bond market.  For the equity market, the link 
between liquidity and the speed of price adjustment has been well documented.  For example, Chordia Name (2008) show 
that return predictability diminishes in the presence of greater liquidity, while Bhushan (1994) ﬁnds liquidity to be inversely 
related to the magnitude of the post-earnings announcement drift.  Evidence for a link between liquidity and bond market 
eﬃciency is reported in Ronen and Zhou (2013) .  If lower levels of liquidity in the bond market impede the eﬃciency of 
bonds prices, then the ability of bond returns to predict post-announcement stock returns may be restricted to ﬁrms whose 
bonds are more liquid.  Testing whether, and under what circumstances, the bond price reaction to earnings announcements 
has predictive power for future stock returns is the central focus of this study.  
For my tests I use the TRACE database to calculate raw and abnormal bond returns around 19,518 quarterly earnings 
announcements of 770 unique ﬁrms between the years 2005 and 2014.  As a ﬁrst step in my analysis I partition ﬁrms each 
quarter into deciles according to the bond price reaction to that quarter’s earnings announcement.  For a ﬁrm with multiple 
bonds, the ﬁrm’s bond price reaction is the value-weighted average of the ﬁrm’s individual bond returns.  For each decile I 
then calculate the average buy-and-hold abnormal stock return over the 60 days subsequent to an earnings announcement.
