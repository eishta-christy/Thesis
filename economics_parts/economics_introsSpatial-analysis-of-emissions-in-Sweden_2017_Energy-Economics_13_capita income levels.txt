The nexus between environmental quality (e. g.  pollution) and
economic development has received much focus for many decades. 
The main objective of this paper is to empirically investigate the
pollution and income relationship across all Swedish municipalities
from a spatial econometric perspective.  Our approach is motivated by
recent but growing literature emphasizing the importance of the spatial
dimension on this link and the implications of ignoring it (e. g.  Burnett
Name, 2013a, 2013b). 
The emissions and income nexus is often modelled within the
framework of the so-called environmental Kuznets curve (EKC)
hypothesis, which posits an inverted U-shaped relationship between
emissions and income, a curvature likely explained by technological
progress and changes in preferences from income growth.  The EKC literature is replete with empirical modelling of different environmental
quality indicators.  The evidence for many pollutants can however be
best described as mixed.  Grossman and Krueger (1991, 1993, 1995)
were among the ﬁrst authors to empirically examine the EKC hypothesis.  In their papers, Grossman and Krueger found the existence of an
inverted U-shaped relationship between air quality (SO2 emission
and “smoke”) and economic growth (per capita GDP).  The inverted
U-shaped relationship implied that the two pollutants' concentration
increased at lower per capita income levels but decreased with
GDP growth at higher levels of income after a certain trajectory. 
Selden and Song (1994) corroborated Grossman and Krueger (1991)
after considering four air pollutants (suspended particulate matter,
sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide) and per capita
GDP1 relationship.
