 1.  Introduction Stock market anomalies reﬂect inefﬁciencies in the way information is disseminated in the market place and reﬂected in asset prices via investors' trades.  Anomalies also provide the basis for active investment strategies that aim to generate abnormal proﬁts.  One of the widely examined anomalies that has been shown to persist in stock markets is the momentum anomaly which relates to the relationship between a stock's historical and subsequent performance (e. g.  Asness, 1994.  Carhart, 1997.  Moskowitz and Grinblatt, 1999.  Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993, 2001).  An important implication of this anomaly is an investment strategy called momentum investing that is based on buying past winner stocks and selling past loser stocks.  Thus, apart from being a matter of concern from an academic perspective, the presence of this anomaly has signiﬁcant investment implications as well.  In another popular strand of the literature, numerous studies have explored the effect of oil market dynamics on stock return and volatility.  Oil can affect stock market dynamics via a number of different channels.  At the ﬁrm level, oil price can affect costs and growth expectations, which then affect stock values.  At the consumer level, oil price can affect consumer spending via its effect on their disposable income, thus affect the demand for the products that drive ﬁrm-level revenues and growth rates.  These arguments have in fact been supported in many studies that show a signiﬁcant oil effect on stock returns and volatility. 1 None of these studies, however, have explored whether oil price dynamics also contribute to stock market anomalies that reﬂect informational inefﬁciencies.  From a behavioral perspective, one can argue that oil price ﬂuctuations can affect investor sentiment, which may be particularly signiﬁcant in high oil-sensitive economies.
