 1.  Introduction  The information contained in earnings announcements plays an important role in the determination of stock prices.   Despite its importance, numerous studies show that stock prices do not immediately and fully incorporate all of the information in earnings announcements and that various accounting-based measures and ﬁnancial statement components have  the ability to predict future stock prices.  Among the reasons offered for these apparent ineﬃciencies are limits on investor  attention, which lead investors to focus on subsets of information, and investors’ inability to fully understand the complexities of the information contained in earnings reports (e. g. , Bartov et al. , 20 0 0 .  Hirshleifer et al. , 2011 .  Doyle et al. , 2006 .   DellaVigna and Pollet, 2009 .  You and Zhang, 2009 ).   Prior research has shown that bond prices, like stock prices, react to earnings news.   This literature, though, does not examine whether corporate bonds incorporate earnings news more eﬃciently than stocks.  The reason why they might is that  the bond market is more heavily dominated by sophisticated investors than is the stock market ( Bessembinder et al. , 2009 .   De Franco et al. , 2009 .  Ronen and Zhou, 2013 ).  These investors have greater resources at their disposal to analyze earnings  reports and are arguably less constrained than are individual investors by either limited attention or diﬃculties in interpreting the information in earnings announcements.  This is supported by Bartov et al.  (20 0 0) and Doyle et al.  (2006) who  show that greater sophisticated investor presence enhances the ability of share prices to quickly incorporate the information  contained in earnings announcements and to mitigate the post-earnings announcement drift.  Consistent with this, Campbell  et al.  (2009) show that institutions trade aggressively to exploit the post-earnings announcement drift.  These results suggest  that if sophisticated investors are more dominant in the bond market than in the stock market, then earnings news would  be incorporated more quickly into bond prices than into stock prices.  Consequently, the bond price reaction to earnings  announcements would, similar to a number of accounting-based measures, have predictive power for future stock returns.   Counterbalancing this is the fact that bonds are typically less liquid and less actively traded than stocks.   Lower levels of liquidity could lead to an increase in the cost of trading and a reduction in the speed with which sophisticated bond  investors trade to their new positions, reducing the relative eﬃciency of the bond market.  For the equity market, the link  between liquidity and the speed of price adjustment has been well documented.  For example, Chordia et al.  (2008) show  that return predictability diminishes in the presence of greater liquidity, while Bhushan (1994) ﬁnds liquidity to be inversely  related to the magnitude of the post-earnings announcement drift.  Evidence for a link between liquidity and bond market  eﬃciency is reported in Ronen and Zhou (2013) .  If lower levels of liquidity in the bond market impede the eﬃciency of  bonds prices, then the ability of bond returns to predict post-announcement stock returns may be restricted to ﬁrms whose  bonds are more liquid.  Testing whether, and under what circumstances, the bond price reaction to earnings announcements  has predictive power for future stock returns is the central focus of this study.   For my tests I use the TRACE database to calculate raw and abnormal bond returns around 19,518 quarterly earnings  announcements of 770 unique ﬁrms between the years 2005 and 2014.  As a ﬁrst step in my analysis I partition ﬁrms each  quarter into deciles according to the bond price reaction to that quarter’s earnings announcement.  For a ﬁrm with multiple  bonds, the ﬁrm’s bond price reaction is the value-weighted average of the ﬁrm’s individual bond returns.  For each decile I  then calculate the average buy-and-hold abnormal stock return over the 60 days subsequent to an earnings announcement.   For the decile with the highest raw (abnormal) bond price reactions, the average buy-and-hold abnormal stock return is 1. 07  (1. 11) percent.  This compares to −1. 70 (−0. 96) percent for the lowest decile.  The difference of 2. 77 (2. 08) percentage points  is signiﬁcantly positive and provides preliminary evidence that the reaction of a ﬁrm’s bonds to its earnings announcements  has predictive power for the ﬁrm’s post-announcement stock return.   Next,  I  test  whether  bonds’  predictive  ability  is  stronger  in  bonds  of  non-investment  grade  ﬁrms  than  for  those  of  investment-grade ﬁrms.  I conjecture that this will be true because bonds of investment-grade ﬁrms are in little danger  of default, and so earnings news is unlikely to have much of an effect on their prices.  In contrast, the prices of bonds of  non-investment grade ﬁrms, which are riskier, should be more sensitive to earnings information.  This is consistent with  existing empirical evidence that the price sensitivity to ﬁrm-speciﬁc information is greater for non-investment grade bonds  than for investment-grade bonds (e. g. , Easton et al. , 2009 and Defond and Zhang, 2014 ).   Applying  the  same  univariate  analysis  above,  I  ﬁnd  that  the  difference  between  the  average  buy-and-hold  abnormal  stock returns of the highest and lowest raw (abnormal) bond return deciles of the bonds of non-investment grade ﬁrms is  a positive and signiﬁcant 7. 49 (6. 35) percentage points, while it is insigniﬁcant for the subsample of bonds of investmentgrade ﬁrms.  These results suggest that the ability of bond returns to predict stock prices comes exclusively from the bonds  of non-investment ﬁrms, consistent with my conjecture.  Moreover, these results also show that, within non-investment  grade ﬁrms, the predictive ability is driven mostly by bonds that have a negative price reaction to earnings announcements,  consistent with bond investors being more sensitive to downside risk.   I next test whether the ability of the bond price reaction to earnings announcements is incremental to that of unexpected  earnings and accruals.  To do so, I ﬁrst sort my sample into quintiles according to standardized unexpected earnings ( SUE)  every quarter.  Within each of these quintiles, I again sort into quintiles based on the bond price reaction.  I ﬁnd that for  the lowest SUE quintile the difference between the 60-day average buy-and-hold abnormal stock return of the highest and  lowest quintile of the raw (abnormal) bond price reaction is a signiﬁcant 2. 95 (2. 55) percentage points.  The difference is  a signiﬁcant 2. 64 (2. 01) percentage points for the highest SUE quintile.  These results provide evidence that the predictive  ability of the bond price reaction to earnings announcements for future stock prices is incremental to that of unexpected  earnings.   Separately analyzing the investment-grade and non-investment grade ﬁrm subsamples shows that bonds’ incremental  predictive ability over unexpected earnings is driven by the subsample of non-investment grade ﬁrms, consistent with the  prior univariate results.  Focusing on the subsample of non-investment grade ﬁrms, we see that in the lowest SUE quintile,  where we would expect negative future stock returns, the mean return is actually positive when the bond price reaction to  the earnings announcement is high.  Similarly, in the highest SUE quintile, where we would expect future stock returns to  be positive, the mean stock return is actually negative when the bond price reaction to the earnings announcement is low.   In these cases, the bond price reaction, not the SUE , predicts the sign of the future stock return.
