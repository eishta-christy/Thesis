
Corporate directors have access to material non-public information, which makes them a potential information source for
professional traders.  Directors are, of course, required to keep sensitive material private: Delaware law recognizes a director's
duty of conﬁdentiality, and corporations have comprehensive policies in place to prevent leaks.  Investors, too, face regulatory
scrutiny and reputational costs if they use inside information in traceable manners, and these safeguards seem to be effective
in some institutional settings (Grifﬁn Name, 2012).  However, sensitive information can travel through education networks from
senior corporate ofﬁcers to mutual fund managers and sell-side analysts (Cohen Name, 2008, 2010).  This raises an important
question: to what extent do director networks transmit information that sophisticated traders are able to exploit. 
We investigate whether the breadth of directors' professional connections systematically affects the likelihood of
information leakage to sophisticated traders.  Well-connected directors interact with scores of people, and unguarded
conversations can easily reveal sensitive facts.  In addition, Larcker Name (2013) show that ﬁrms beneﬁt from more connected
boards because board connections are a conduit of information exchange.  Yet an important competitive advantage of
connected directors stems from their ability to provide insights that would otherwise be inaccessible to less connected
colleagues.  Fulﬁlling this role might require some deliberate sharing of sensitive material.  Sophisticated traders, who gather,
analyze and interpret data from multiple sources, have a comparative advantage when piecing together information about
ﬁrms with highly connected directors.  We therefore study possible information transmission from corporate directors to
sophisticated traders by examining the relation between board connectedness and the informativeness of trades made by
short sellers, option traders, and institutional investors. 
Our results indicate that these investor groups are indeed more informed when trading stocks of companies with more
connected boards.  We measure informed trading as the monthly level of short interest, the ratio of monthly option volume
to stock volume, and weekly order imbalances of institutional traders.  From BoardEx, we obtain the number of ﬁrst-degree
connections for each director, which includes links through educational institutions attended, current and previous employers,
military service and civic institutions.  To ensure that our measure of board connectedness is not driven by factors that
have been documented to affect the ﬁrm's information environment, we ﬁrst aggregate the connections of all board members
and then orthogonalize them with respect to ﬁrm size, board size, ﬁrm age, the number of analysts and institutional
ownership.  We examine portfolios sorted by board connectedness and each of the three measures of informed trading
and ﬁnd that the annualized return difference between the highest and lowest quintile of informed trading in highly connected boards is signiﬁcantly more pronounced compared to the same return difference in ﬁrms with less connected boards. 
The economic magnitude ranges from 4% for option volume and 5. 4% for short interest, to 7. 2% for institutional order
imbalance. 
Next, we examine whether the trades of sophisticated investors predict changes in ﬁrm fundamentals.  Our results indicate
that a higher fraction of negative earnings news is embedded in prices of highly connected ﬁrms ahead of the announcement,
and that sophisticated traders better anticipate earning surprises in ﬁrms with highly connected boards.  Indeed, their trades
predict ﬁrm-speciﬁc news content more broadly, as our analysis of Thompson Reuters' public news data shows.  Changes in
board connectedness are also positively associated with changes in measures of adverse selection costs, such as the probability
of informed trading (PIN), bid–ask spreads and the price impact measure of Amihud (2002).  In a series of robustness checks
we establish that neither family ownership, corporate governance quality, nor asset tangibility, drive our ﬁndings. 
Our study contributes to several strands of the literature.  First, we add novel insights to recent studies examining the
role of director networks in ﬁnancial markets.  Among directors these networks contribute to higher ﬁrm performance
(Larcker Name, 2013), the dissemination of CEO compensation practices (Wong Name, 2015), stock option backdating (Bizjak
Name, 2009), and earnings management (Chiu Name, 2012).  Board members and their social networks inﬂuence which
companies become targets in change-of-control transactions (Stuart and Yim, 2010).  Directors of Finnish ﬁrms earn sizable
abnormal returns by trading stocks where they have information advantages through their board connections (Berkman Name, 2014).  We build on these insights by documenting that board connections in general affect the external corporate
information environment, increase the potential for informed trading, and facilitate the dissemination of information into
stock prices.  While prior research suggests that analysts, media outlets and managers have incentives to convey positive
news (McNichols and O'Brien, 1997; Kothari Name, 2009), we show that negative news, in particular, ﬂows through director
networks. 
Second, we contribute to research into the information sources of sophisticated traders.  Short sellers predict the outcome
of earnings surprises (Christophe Name, 2004), detect ﬁnancial misconduct (Karpoff and Lou, 2010), and uncover hidden bad
news in high levels of accruals (Hirshleifer Name, 2011).  Short sellers excel in processing publicly available news (Engelberg
Name, 2012) and receive tips ahead of analyst downgrades (Christophe Name, 2010).  Option trades (Pan and Poteshman, 2006;
Johnson and So, 2012) and institutional trades (Grifﬁn Name, 2003; Campbell Name, 2009; Puckett and Yan, 2011) also predict
future stock prices.  Our ﬁndings suggest that more connected directors contribute, directly or inadvertently, to the information set of short sellers, option traders, and institutional investors.  More generally, we advance an emergent literature
that examines how a ﬁrm's organizational structure affects its information environment.  Anderson Name (2012) report that
family ownership increases informed trading.  We complement their ﬁndings by directly linking the governance structure of
the ﬁrm to sophisticated trading in the ﬁrm's stock. 
<Middle> Identiﬁcation strategy and hypotheses development. 
How does material non-public information ﬂow from corporate insiders to sophisticated investors.  What organizational
characteristics restrain or exacerbate the magnitude of information transmission.  How does this affect trading and security
prices.  These questions, while essential to understand, are difﬁcult to answer.  Insiders can be found on every level of the
corporate hierarchy, the sophistication of traders is not readily apparent, both groups have incentives to keep their conversations about privileged information secret, and traders frequently disguise trades that could trigger regulatory attention. 
In light of these challenges, we develop a novel identiﬁcation strategy that focuses on the possible information transmission
between two important groups of people: we investigate whether patterns in trading behavior and securities prices suggest
that privileged information ﬂows from corporate directors to sophisticated traders. 
By focusing on the board of directors, we study a group of clearly identiﬁable corporate insiders with privileged information about their ﬁrms.  Unfettered access to material, non-public information is necessary to monitor and advise management, the social networks of directors are observable, and recent studies suggest that these networks are important
conduits of information exchange.  We argue that sophisticated traders can obtain privileged information from directors and
trade proﬁtably on that information before it becomes available to the broader market.  If information is channeled towards
sophisticated traders, their proﬁtability will be high.  In contrast, if connected directors disseminate sensitive information
broadly, prices will quickly incorporate it, leaving smaller proﬁt opportunities for sophisticated traders.  As possible transmission channels we consider inadvertent information leakage, deliberate sharing of sensitive information, and “mosaic”
information gathering.  We discuss each channel in turn. 
The risk of inadvertent information leakage increases with the size of the network of people who are privy to material
non-public information. 1 Steele (1989) formalizes this idea, and models the likelihood of disclosing a secret as proportional
to the square of the number of people who know the secret.  More connections increase the difﬁculty of guarding against the
unintended disclosure of private information.  We therefore expect that inadvertent information leakage will be more
pronounced for companies with more connected boards. 
Directors also face incentives to share sensitive information deliberately.  After all, an important competitive advantage of
broadly connected directors stems from their ability to obtain and share insights that would otherwise be inaccessible to
less connected colleagues.  Molm (2003) suggests that reciprocal information sharing increases the status and inﬂuence of an
individual within a network.  Fisman Name (2012) remark that “board membership more broadly creates a context for a kind
of reciprocal attraction and friendship among a fraternity of individuals. ” While SEC enforcement actions allege that
directors have deliberately provided information to traders,2 our study does not assess the legality of directors' actions. 
Reciprocal sharing of sensitive material by connected directors does not necessarily harm shareholders; the beneﬁts of
connectedness may outweigh the costs.  Incentives related to reciprocal sharing simply suggest that highly connected
directors are more likely to divulge some sensitive information. 
More connected directors may increase the amount of publicly available information in ways that favor “mosaic”
information gathering by sophisticated investors.  Jarrell (2011) argues: “Securities analysts and investment managers legally
gather, analyze and interpret large quantities of information from multiple sources.  From this information, investment
recommendations and decisions are routinely made.  Not until the ‘bits and pieces’ of stray information are compiled
together into a ‘complete picture of the company’ does it sometimes reveal material, non-public information.  It is my
understanding that under the ‘mosaic theory,’ analysts and investment managers are free to act on this compilation of
information without risking liability under the insider trading laws. ”3 Due to their extensive networks, more connected
directors provide better access to these “bits and pieces”: they are members of clubs, societies, and other ﬁrms, they are
often invited to give speeches, and frequently interpret publicly available information about their ﬁrm.  While most investors
lack the resources to piece together this kind of public information, sophisticated traders physically track directors,4 comb
through public records of their large consumer and asset purchases and attend their invited speaking events.  Some directors
are even spied on. 5 The more connected the members of corporate boards are, the greater the amount of difﬁcult-to-process
information that sophisticated trades might be able to access. 
While inadvertent information leakage, deliberate tipping, and “mosaic” information gathering are three possible
channels of information transmission, it is not clear that companies with more connected directors are indeed associated
with more informed trading: Federal regulations prohibit selective disclosure, Delaware law recognizes the duty of conﬁdentiality as part of a director's duty of loyalty, and corporate lawyers have developed comprehensive conﬁdentiality
policies to prevent leaks.  In addition, Grifﬁn Name (2012) argue that institutional investors are reluctant to use inside
information in traceable manners.  Our null hypothesis is that there is no systematic link between board connectedness and
informed trading. 
Banerjee and Eckard (2001) , however, doubt that insider trading regulations effectively limit informed trading.  Many
studies document informed trading among short sellers, option traders and institutional investors, and more connected
boards might increase the information ﬂow to these sophisticated traders.  The information channels that we identify are not
the only possible ones, they are not necessarily illegal or mutually exclusive, and we are not assessing their relative
importance.  Our alternative hypothesis simply states that sophisticated investors' trades are more informed when they trade
shares in ﬁrms with more connected boards. 
3.  Sample selection, variables and descriptive statistics. 
3. 1.  Sample selection. 
The BoardEx database tracks connections of corporate directors and executives from 2002 onward.  Since we rely on
BoardEx to quantify board connections, our sample period begins in January 2002 and ends in December 2011.  Stock prices,
trading volume and shares outstanding are from CRSP, book-to-market ratios, leverage, ROA, R&D, industry segments, and
other accounting variables are from COMPUSTAT, options data come from Ivy OptionMetrics, institutional ownership and
insider trading data are provided by Thomson Financial, and analysts' forecasts by I/B/E/S.  We limit our analysis to common
stocks (share code 10 or 11) of non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms traded on AMEX, NYSE, or NASDAQ and require stocks to have at least 12
months of past return data, at least 10 days per month with available trades and return data, a month-end stock price above
one dollar, and sufﬁcient data from COMPUSTAT to compute accounting ratios as of December of the previous year. 
3. 2.  Measures of informed trading
In our analysis we use three measures of informed trading.  Our ﬁrst measure is the monthly level of Short Interest,
deﬁned as current shares sold short divided by total shares outstanding.  Monthly short interest data are available for the
entire sample period for which we have board characteristics and options data.  Several studies, including Asquith Name
(2005), Desai Name (2006) and Karpoff and Lou (2010) use monthly short interest as a measure of short selling activity, and
document that short interest contains negative information about stock prices and future ﬁrm fundamentals.  Boehmer Name
(2010) argue that absence of short interest can be viewed as a signal of good news.  Thus, short interest can signal bad news
by its presence, or good news by its absence. 
Our second measure of informed trading is the ratio of total monthly put and call trading volume to stock trading
volume, or Option/Stock volume.  Pan and Poteshman (2006) provide evidence of informed trading by using proprietary
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) option market data.  More recently, Johnson and So (2012) report that Option/Stock
volume contains negative information about future stock prices. 
Our third measure of informed trading is institutional trading order imbalances.  Grifﬁn Name (2003), Campbell Name
(2009), and Puckett and Yan (2011) document that institutions are informed traders whose trades predict stock returns.  To
measure institutional trading, we use the weekly trading order imbalance of institutional traders in each stock.  The trading
order imbalance, Institutional OIB, measures whether the observed weekly trading volume is dominated by institutional
buying or selling.  We obtain transaction level data on institutional trading from Ancerno Ltd.  for the period from 2002 to
2011.  For each stock, we calculate order imbalance as buyer minus seller initiated institutional trading over a week, normalized by total institutional trading activity measured as the total number of shares traded.  A positive institutional trading
order imbalance indicates that institutions are net buyers, and a positive relation between weekly order imbalance and
future returns suggests that institutions are informed traders.  We expect this relation between Institutional OIB and subsequent returns to be more pronounced for ﬁrms with more connected boards.  Following Johnson and So (2012), we
transform all informed trading measures into decile ranks and use the decile ranks of these variables in multivariate
regressions that feature the particular informed trading measure. 
3. 3.  Measuring board connectedness
We obtain connections for each director from the BoardEx database and aggregate them at the board level.  This
straightforward measure of board connections merely enumerates the number of ﬁrst-degree links for all directors on the
board.  This includes connections through educational institutions attended, current and previous employers, military service as well as civic institutions like non-proﬁt boards. 6 Yet this simple aggregation suffers from two obvious drawbacks. 
First, by construction, this aggregation increases mechanically with the number of directors, leading to a Spearman rank
correlation of more than 0. 6 between board size and aggregate connections. 
Second, several factors have been identiﬁed in the literature to affect the ﬁrm's information environment and the
potential returns from informed trading, which are also correlated with aggregate director connections.  For example, ﬁrm
size affects the quality and quantity of information that can be exploited by informed traders (Hong Name, 2000), but
directors of larger ﬁrms tend to be more connected within the BoardEx universe.  Similarly, Zhang (2006) argues that ﬁrm
age captures differences of opinion related to future events, but directors of older ﬁrms have more aggregate connections. 
Firms with more analyst following are also likely to have more connected directors, but the amount of analyst coverage
directly affects the information available about the ﬁrm (Hong Name, 2000).  Finally, D'Avolio (2002) provides evidence that
institutional ownership measures shorting costs because it affects the supply of lendable shares, and Cohen Name (2007)
document that the ability to exploit information depends on the ability to access loaned shares.  At the same time, directors
of ﬁrms with more institutional investors also tend to have more connections. 
To ensure that our measure of board connectedness is not driven by any of these factors, we regress the natural logarithm
of aggregate board connections on the natural logarithms of ﬁrm size, board size, ﬁrm age, number of analysts, and on
institutional ownership, and use the residual values from these year-end cross-sectional regressions, which we term Connectedness, to categorize ﬁrms in our sample. 
3. 4.  Additional control variables
Beyond orthogonalizing our Connectedness measure with respect to factors that have been shown to jointly affect
opportunities for informed traders and aggregate director connections, we account in our multivariate regressions for
characteristics of the ﬁrm's information and contracting environment that might affect board characteristics or the measures of informed trading.  For example, growth opportunities (book-to-market) are an important proxy of the corporate
information environment that has been shown to affect a ﬁrm's governance choices.  However, ﬁrms that are growing more
slowly are less opaque, have less information uncertainty, and hence, lower opportunities for informed trading (Hong Name,
2000; Zhang, 2006).  In contrast, higher research and development (R&D) expenses lead to greater information asymmetry
(Aboody and Lev, 2000, among others), and complex ﬁrms, which operate in different industries or distinct business segments, have slower information diffusion (Cohen and Lou, 2012).  Because these attributes could attract informed traders
and also affect board characteristics, we include in our analysis R&D expenditure and the number of business segments in
which the ﬁrm operates.  We also control for return on assets (ROA) since it attracts informed traders' attention.  We include
liquidity, turnover and return volatility (IVOL) in our analysis to ensure that our results are not driven by differences in the
cost of exploiting information (Pontiff, 2006) and include past return to control for short-term reversal or medium-horizon
stock price continuation (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993).  Table 1 provides deﬁnitions for all control variables. 
3. 5.  Descriptive statistics
Table 2 presents time-series averages of cross-sectional statistics for all companies in our sample.  Since the number of
available observations differs for our three measures of informed trading, we report monthly statistics for the Short Interest
sample in Panel A, for the Option/Stock volume ratio sample in Panel B, and weekly statistics for the Institutional OIB sample
in Panel C.  The average board in our BoardEx sample has around 4000 aggregate connections.  The distribution of aggregate
connections is skewed, with a median and standard deviation of around 3000, and a range from 225 to over 24,000 connections.  After orthogonalization, which we describe in Section 3. 4, Connectedness (which is in natural logs) ranges from
 1. 7348 to 1. 0987 in the Short Interest sample, from  1. 5636 to 1. 0158 in the Option/Stock volume sample, and from
 1. 7468 to 1. 0900 in the Institutional OIB sample.  For the Short Interest and Institutional OIB samples, the average ﬁrm is
around 25 years old and has a market capitalization that exceeds one billion dollars.  The Option/Stock volume sample
requires companies with traded options, which limits us to companies that are slightly older and larger: the average ﬁrm is
around 26 years old with a market capitalization that exceeds seven billion dollars.  Other ﬁrm characteristics do not notably
differ across the three samples.  Average Short Interest is 4. 9%, average Option/Stock volume is 3. 8%, and the average Institutional OIB is 5. 0%. 
Table 3 presents times series averages of cross-sectional Spearman rank correlations.  Here again, we report statistics for
the Short Interest sample in Panel A, the Option/Stock volume sample in Panel B, and the Institutional OIB sample in Panel C. 
The correlations illustrate why we orthogonalize aggregate connections to create the Connectedness measure.  Aggregate
connections is highly correlated with several ﬁrm characteristics.  Panel A reveals that the correlation coefﬁcient is 0. 61 for
ﬁrm size, 0. 62 for board size, 0. 20 for ﬁrm age, 0. 14 for the number of analysts, and 0. 46 for institutional ownership.  By
orthogonalizing we create a Connectedness measure that is highly correlated with aggregate connections, yet largely
uncorrelated with ﬁrm characteristics that have been documented to affect the prevalence of informed trading.  While the
correlation coefﬁcient between Connectedness and aggregate connection is 0. 7, the correlations with ﬁrm size, board size, ﬁrm
age, number of analysts, and institutional ownership do not exceed 0. 03.  Connectedness effectively measures the crosssectional variation in board connections, yet is far less likely to reﬂect differences in the ﬁrm's information environment. 
4.  Connectedness, informed trading, and stock returns
In this section we investigate the link between stock returns and informed trading across ﬁrms with different Connectedness.  We expect a stronger relation between our measures of informed trading and future returns for companies with
more connected boards. 
4. 1.  Portfolio analysis
We begin our analysis by sorting stocks into equal groups of low, medium, and high board Connectedness, and then into
quintiles based on the level of informed trading.  In the Short Interest and Option/Stock volume samples, portfolios are formed
at the beginning of every month, held for a month after portfolio formation, and portfolio returns are calculated as equally
weighted averages of monthly stock returns.  In the Institutional OIB sample, portfolios are formed every week, held for a
week after portfolio formation, and portfolio returns are calculated as equally weighted averages of weekly stock returns. 
We report time series averages alphas (αs) from the Fama-French three factor model (Fama and French, 1993), augmented
with a momentum factor (Carhart, 1997).  All tests of statistical signiﬁcance are based on Newey–West standard errors. 
Panel A of Table 4 displays portfolio results for the Short Interest sample.  The ﬁrst column, labeled All, aggregates the
Connectedness groups and conﬁrms that, consistent with previous studies, Short Interest is negatively associated with
subsequent stock returns.  For the three lowest short selling quintiles we ﬁnd that subsequent returns are higher for more
connected boards, which is consistent with Larcker Name (2013).  Whereas Larcker Name (2013) look at average returns across
connectedness portfolios, we examine informed trading within connectedness portfolios.  We ﬁnd that the difference in riskadjusted returns (αs) between the highest and lowest Short Interest quintile (S5 S1) for the high Connectedness group is
 1. 161%, per month.  In contrast, the same difference is only  0. 681% in the medium Connectedness group and  0. 697% in
the low Connectedness group. 
Put differently, the novel ﬁnding of our study is that the risk-adjusted return between the high and low Short Interest
groups (S5 S1) is 0. 464% per month more negative for ﬁrms with highly connected boards than for ﬁrms with less connected boards, and this difference is statistically signiﬁcant at the one percent level (t-statistic¼  3. 89).  This means that the
annualized return difference between the highest and lowest quintile of Short Interest in ﬁrms with highly connected boards
is about 5. 4% more negative than the same return difference for ﬁrms with less connected boards.  High Short Interest
predicts negative returns more strongly in ﬁrms with well-connected directors. 
Panel B reports results for the Option/Stock volume sample.  Again, the column labeled All aggregates the Connectedness
groups and indicates that Option/Stock volume is negatively associated with future stock returns as documented by Johnson
and So (2012).  Consistent with the results for Short Interest in Panel A, the difference in risk-adjusted returns between the
highest and lowest Option/Stock volume quintile (O/S5 O/S1) is 0. 340% per month more negative for ﬁrms with highly
connected boards than for ﬁrms with less connected boards, and this difference is again statistically signiﬁcant at the one
percent level (t¼  2. 64).  High Option/Stock volume also predicts negative returns more strongly in ﬁrms with wellconnected directors. 
Panel C presents results for the Institutional OIB sample.  For each stock in the Ancerno database the institutional trading
imbalance (Institutional OIB) is constructed as institutional buys minus institutional sells over a week.  Unlike short interest
or options trading, where informed trading is associated with negative returns, higher Institutional OIB is associated with
positive returns, and lower Institutional OIB with negative returns.  Consistent with the short interest and option trading
results, the risk-adjusted return between the high and low institutional order imbalance groups (OIBS5 – OIBS1) is 0. 134%
per week more positive for ﬁrms with highly connected boards than for ﬁrms with less connected boards, and this difference
is statistically signiﬁcant at the ﬁve percent level (t¼2. 14).  This means that the annualized return difference between the
highest and lowest quintile of institutional order imbalance in ﬁrms with highly connected boards is about 7. 2% higher than
the same return difference for ﬁrms with less connected boards. 
We also examine time-varying patterns in return predictability within low and high connected boards to ensure that our
results are not driven by a speciﬁc time period.  For example, our ﬁndings could be affected by the passages of Regulation Fair
Disclosure or the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, which restrict corporate information sharing and governance structure.  Yet when we
plot the annual quintile hedge return for each connectedness tercile in Fig.  1, we see no clear time-series pattern.  All three
informed trading measures predict stock returns more strongly in ﬁrms with well-connected directors, and these results are
not driven by a particular subperiod.  The results could be impacted by other stock characteristics, so we investigate that
possibility next. 
4. 2.  Multivariate regressions
In this section, we extend the portfolio analysis from Section 4. 1 by performing cross-sectional multivariate regressions. 
These regressions allow us to control for various other stock characteristics that could potentially affect the relation between
our informed trading measures and returns across different levels of Connectedness.  In particular, we estimate Fama and
MacBeth (1973) regressions of subsequent returns on the informed trading measures, Connectedness, and the interaction
between the two, while controlling for several ﬁrm characteristics, where Mi;t is one of our three informed trading measures: Short Interest, Option/Stock volume, or Institutional OIB.  The
dependent variable is monthly return for the Short Interest and Option/Stock volume samples, and weekly return for the
Institutional OIB sample.  If sophisticated traders are more informed when trading stocks in ﬁrms with more connected
boards, then we expect a negative coefﬁcient on the interaction term ðβ3 o0Þ for the Short Interest and Option/Stock volume
samples, and a positive coefﬁcient ðβ3 40Þ for the Institutional OIB sample. 
The multivariate regression results in Table 5 support these predictions and corroborate the portfolio results.  The estimated coefﬁcient on the interaction between the informed trading variable, Mi;t, and Connectedness are  0. 395 (t¼  2. 81)
for Short Interest,  0. 513 (t¼  2. 59) for Option/Stock volume, and 0. 094 (t¼2. 10) for Institutional OIB.  The positive and
statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcient on the direct effect of Connectedness in the ﬁrst two columns conﬁrms previous results by
Larcker Name (2013).  Yet even after controlling for additional stock characteristics, we ﬁnd that short interest, options trading
and institutional trade order imbalances contain more information about future stock returns if the ﬁrms' boards are more
connected. 
5.  Board connectedness, informed traders and earnings surprises. 
Our analysis so far suggests that the information content of short interest, options trading and institutional order
imbalances, as inferred from return predictability, is higher among ﬁrms with more connected boards.  In this section, we
examine the role of ﬁrm Connectedness on the relation between informed trading prior to earnings announcements and the
earnings surprise.  Earning announcements are scheduled events that often convey substantial information about ﬁrm
fundamentals.  If information transmission from boards provides private information about the future prospects of the
company, then trades of these investors should contain information about future changes in ﬁrm fundamentals.  We
therefore expect a stronger relation between our informed trading measures prior to earnings announcements and subsequently announced earnings surprises for companies with more connected boards. 
We estimate quarterly Fama–MacBeth (1973) regressions of earnings surprises on the informed trading measures,
Connectedness, and the interaction between the two, while controlling for several ﬁrm characteristics.  In other words, we
run regressions of the form; q is one of our three informed trading measures: Short Interest, Option/Stock volume, or Institutional OIB.  These are
measured one month prior to the month of the earnings announcement in the case of Short Interest and Option/Stock volume,
or the week prior in the case of Institutional OIB. 
We use three different measures of earnings surprises: Unexpected Earnings, Standardized Unexpected Earnings (SUE) and
Analyst Surprise.  Unexpected Earnings is calculated as ðEPSi;q  EPSi;q  4Þ=Pi;q  4, where EPSi;q and EPSi;q  4 are earnings per
share before extraordinary items for ﬁrm i in quarters q and q 4, respectively, and Pi;q  4 is the stock price in quarter q 4. 
Standardized Unexpected Earnings (SUE) is patterned after Bernard and Thomas (1989, 1990) as ðEPSi;q EPSi;q  4  μwhere μi;q and σi;q are the mean and standard deviations of earnings changes ðEPSi;q EPSi;q  4Þ in the previous eight
quarters.  Analyst Surprise is the difference between actual earnings per share (EPS) reported in I/B/E/S in quarter q, and the
median of the most recent forecasts made by analysts following the ﬁrm over the 90 days prior to the earnings
announcement; this difference is then scaled by Pi;q  4.  We employ the same control variables as in Table 5, which are all
measured one month prior to the month of the earnings announcement.  As before, we expect a negative coefﬁcient on the
interaction term ðβ3 o0Þ for the Short Interest and Option/Stock volume samples, and a positive coefﬁcient ðβ3 40Þ for the
Institutional OIB sample. 
Columns (1)–(3) of Table 6 indicate that our measures of informed trading predict unexpected earnings more strongly in
ﬁrms with more connected boards.  The estimated coefﬁcient on the interaction between the informed trading variable and
Connectedness is  0. 681 (t¼  2. 52) for Short Interest and  0. 439 (t¼  3. 69) for Option/Stock volume.  The same coefﬁcient
in the Institutional OIB sample is positive, as predicted, but falls short of being statistically signiﬁcant at conventional levels
(0. 259, t¼1. 42).  We ﬁnd similar results when we use SUE as our measure of earnings surprise in columns (4)–(6).  Both Short
Interest and Option/Stock volume predict SUE more strongly in ﬁrms with more connected boards; the estimated coefﬁcient
on the interaction between the informed trading variable and Connectedness is  5. 640 (t¼  3. 07) for Short Interest and
4. 884 (t¼  2. 26) for Option/Stock volume when the dependent variable is SUE.  Results are less precise when we use
Analyst Surprise to measure earnings surprise in columns (7)–(9), but even here we ﬁnd that both Option/Stock volume
(β¼  0. 046, t¼  1. 99) and Institutional OIB (β¼0. 041, t¼1. 78) predict unexpected earnings more strongly in ﬁrms with
more connected boards.  Taken together, these results corroborate our previous ﬁndings that sophisticated traders have
some information advantage when trading stocks of ﬁrms with more connected directors. 
These results are consistent with our hypothesis that informed traders are capitalizing on advanced knowledge of
earnings information.  An alternative interpretation would suggest that highly connected directors actually guard sensitive
information more effectively, that therefore their ﬁrms are more likely to be misvalued, and that sophisticated investors
successfully exploit this misvaluation. 7 This alternative explanation also predicts, for opposite reasons, more proﬁtable
informed trading in ﬁrms with more connected boards.  One way of distinguishing these two alternative explanations is to
examine how news gets embedded into prices ahead of important information events such as earnings announcements. 
Kothari Name (2009) show that stock prices incorporate a greater fraction of total earnings news ahead of positive earnings
announcements when compared to negative earnings announcements, suggesting that managers withhold bad news relative
to good news.  If highly connected boards increase inadvertent or deliberate information leakage to sophisticated traders, a
greater fraction of earnings news should be embedded into prices ahead of the earnings announcements in highly connected
ﬁrms.  In contrast, if highly connected directors better guard sensitive information than less connected directors, a greater
fraction of earnings news should be embedded into prices prior to announcements in less connected ﬁrms. 
To investigate this assertion we plot stock returns prior to earnings announcements for the high and low board Connectedness groups.  We present scaled cumulative average abnormal returns for good news and bad news over a threemonth period leading up to the earnings announcements.  We classify the lowest decile of earnings surprises as bad news
and the highest decile of earnings surprises as good news.  Following Kothari Name (2009) we use the total return over the
window to scale returns, which provides an estimate of the fraction of total news revealed over that time period.  If more
news is leaked prior to earnings surprises, we expect a higher fraction of news to be revealed over time. 
For the high and low board Connectedness groups, we present results for bad news in Panel A, and results for good news
in Panel B of Fig.  2.  The graphs in Panel A show that ﬁrms with highly connected boards release about 87% of bad news
ahead of earnings announcements, while ﬁrms with less connected boards release about 63% of bad news.  In contrast, Panel
B shows no discernible difference between the high and low board Connectedness groups.  This ﬁnding indicates that a
greater fraction of negative news is revealed for highly connected ﬁrms, which suggests that highly connected directors
more readily facilitate the transmission of privileged information; it does not support the argument that highly connected
directors are better stewards of privileged information than less connected directors. 
At ﬁrst glance, Fig.  2 might suggest that the potential return for short sellers ahead of bad earnings news in highly
connected ﬁrms is lower than the potential return in less connected ﬁrms.  This would seem to contradict the central ﬁnding
in our paper that short sellers who trade in stocks of ﬁrms with highly connected boards earn higher proﬁts than those who
trade in stocks of less connected ﬁrms.  However, this inconsistency arises only if one assumes that, prior to earnings
announcements, short sellers are equally likely to trade ahead of bad news in both highly and less connected ﬁrms.  This is
not the case; short sellers trade more readily in stocks of more connected ﬁrms because they are able to obtain more
privileged information about them.  In other words, the information ﬂow ahead of earnings is not broadly disseminated, but
is channeled towards sophisticated traders.  These traders are thus more often correct when trading in stocks with highly
connected boards, and, hence, earn higher proﬁts. 
6.  Board connectedness, informed traders and ﬁrm-speciﬁc news sentiment
Sophisticated traders predict stock returns more accurately for ﬁrms with more connected boards, and some information
transmission occurs, apparently, prior to quarterly earnings disclosures.  In addition to corporate earnings, directors are privy
to a wide variety of value-relevant information such as new product launches, acquisitions, restructurings,
layoffs,
accounting restatements, loss of major contracts, or departures of key executives.  In this section, we investigate whether the
trades of short sellers, option trader, and institutional investors more strongly predict the sentiment of ﬁrm-speciﬁc news
for ﬁrms with more connected boards.  For those ﬁrms we expect that higher Short Interest, higher Options/Stock volume, and
lower Institutional OIB better predict negative corporate news, while lower Short Interest, lower Options/Stock volume, and
higher Institutional OIB better predict positive corporate news. 
To test this prediction, we estimate Fama–MacBeth (1973) regressions of ﬁrm-speciﬁc news Sentiment on each of the
informed trading measures ðMi;tÞ, Connectedness, and the interaction between the two, while controlling for several other
ﬁrm characteristics. 
As before, Mi;t denotes Short Interest, Option/Stock volume, or Institutional OIB. 
The dependent variable, Sentiment, is a text-based sentiment measure of ﬁrm-speciﬁc news in the media, aggregated
over a month or a week.  The data come from Thomson Reuters News Analytics and are available from 2003.  Thomson
collects corporate news items from public sources, uses computational linguistics to classify each item according to its
relevance, sentiment, novelty, and topic, and provides three sentiment scores for each item: negative, neutral and positive. 
Each score takes a value from 0 to 100, but the scores in the three categories always sum to 100.  Higher scores in a speciﬁc
sentiment category indicate that the news is more likely to belong to that category.  For each news item, we calculate the
difference between positive and negative sentiment scores, so that a higher difference reﬂects a more positive news content. 
For each ﬁrm, we average across these differences to obtain our measure of monthly or weekly ﬁrm-speciﬁc news Sentiment. 
To ensure that our ﬁrm-speciﬁc sentiment measure is based on novel fundamental news about individual companies, we
exclude news items categorized as “order imbalances” or “stock prices” to eliminate news stories that simply mention stock
price movements.  We also exclude news with a “relevance score” below 50 to capture only ﬁrm-speciﬁc news, and we
eliminate repeated news. 8
The results of our news sentiment analysis are presented in Table 7.  Our measures of informed trading predict not only
earnings surprises more strongly in ﬁrms with more connected boards, but also ﬁrm-speciﬁc news sentiment: The
estimated coefﬁcient on the interaction between the informed trading variable and Connectedness is  1. 4454 (t¼  2. 32) for
Short Interest,  1. 639 (t¼  3. 07) for Option/Stock volume, and 1. 242 (t¼2. 26) for Institutional OIB.  Taken together, the results
in Tables 6 and 7 suggest that sophisticated traders have greater insights about upcoming earnings and ﬁrm-speciﬁc news
when trading stocks in ﬁrms with more connected boards. 
7.  Alternative explanations, robustness tests, and corroborating evidence. 
Short sellers, option traders, and institutional investors seem to be more informed about upcoming earnings and news of
ﬁrms with highly connected boards, and their trades predict stock returns better as Connectedness increases.  In this section,
we focus on three alternative explanations for our ﬁndings by examining the role of family ownership, corporate governance
and asset tangibility.  These factors could inﬂuence the ﬁrm's information environment and strengthen the relation between
informed trading and subsequent stock returns, while also being related to the Connectedness of the ﬁrm.  We also perform a
battery of other robustness tests. 
7. 1.  Family ownership
In a recent study, Anderson Name (2012) ﬁnd more informed short sales in family-controlled ﬁrms than in ﬁrms with
diffuse ownership.  If family-owned ﬁrms also happen to have more connected boards, our results might be due to ownership characteristics.  To explore this possibility, we create a family ﬁrm indicator variable using the deﬁnition of family ﬁrm
and data from Anderson Name (2012).  We then replicate the multivariate regressions tests from Table 5 and include the
family ﬁrm indicator by itself, as well as an interaction of the family ﬁrm indicator and our measures of informed trading, as
additional control variables.  The ﬁndings are reported in Panel A of Table 8.  In our analysis, for each measure of informed
trading, we report results with and without Connectedness. 
Consistent with Anderson Name (2012), short sellers appear to be more informed when trading the shares of family ﬁrms,
yet accounting for family ﬁrm status does not change our inference: measures of directional trading by sophisticated
investors are stronger predictors of future returns among ﬁrms with more connected boards.  These ﬁndings might not be
surprising; Anderson and Reeb (2004, p.  221, Table 1) document that family ﬁrms do not differ from other ﬁrms with respect
to board size, and board size and board Connectedness are highly correlated.  Anderson Name (2012) link trading by sophisticated investors to ownership structure while our study links it to an aspect of board structure.  The two phenomena appear
to be distinct. 
7. 2.  Corporate governance
Effective governance can enhance ﬁnancial transparency by mitigating executives' incentives to distort information
disclosures (Leuz Name, 2003) and may increase operational transparency by limiting executives' ability to expropriate ﬁrm
value through shirking, empire building, or perquisite consumption (Bebchuk Name, 2009).  Chung Name (2010) report that
ﬁrms with better corporate governance are associated with higher liquidity and lower probability of information-based
trading.  This suggests that, on the one hand, governance quality affects the ﬁrms' information environment.  On the other
hand, several studies link governance quality to board connections.  Guedj and Barnea (2009) ﬁnd weaker monitoring among
more connected directors, and several studies document that value-decreasing practices like option backdating can spread
through board networks (Bizjak Name, 2009).  Together, these studies raise the concern that our results are not indicative of
information transmission through director networks to sophisticated traders; instead, weak corporate governance might be
associated with higher board connections and also create an information environment more conducive to informed trading. 
We investigate this possibility. 
To proxy for the quality of monitoring, we create the variable Outsider, which is the fraction of independent directors on
the board.  We replicate the multivariate regression tests from Table 5 and include Outsider by itself, an interaction term of
Outsider with each measure of informed trading, as well as additional control variables.  In Panel B of Table 8 we report the
results ﬁrst without, and then with interacted Connectedness.  While the informativeness of Short Interest and Institutional
OIB seem unaffected by board independence, the positive and statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcient for Option/Stock volume  Outsider suggests that option traders are less informed when trading stocks in ﬁrms with a greater fraction of outside
directors.  This ﬁnding can be interpreted as supporting the notion that stronger governance is associated with a lower
probability of information-based trading (Chung Name, 2010).  Even so, accounting for the fraction of outside directors does
not change our inference: measures of informed trading predict returns more strongly in ﬁrms with more connected boards. 
In untabulated tests, we replace the fraction of outside directors with the entrenchment index (E-index) of Bebchuk Name
(2009) as an alternative measure of governance quality and conﬁrm that our inference remains unchanged. 
7. 3.  Asset tangibility
Sophisticated investors may have a distinct advantage when trading the shares of ﬁrms with high levels of intangible
assets.  Such ﬁrms might offer greater opportunities to exploit private information or to proﬁt from sophisticated processing
of public information.  Faleye Name (2014) argue that ﬁrms with better connected executives exploit intangible assets more
efﬁciently because connections help CEOs identify, evaluate, and exploit innovative ideas.  This raises the concern that the
level of asset intangibility is correlated with Connectedness, which may, in fact, explain our results.  To explore this possibility,
we create an asset tangibility variable, deﬁned as the ratio of Property, Plants, and Equipment (PPE) to total assets.  We
replicate the multivariate regression tests from Table 5 and include asset tangibility by itself, an interaction term of asset
tangibility with each measure of informed trading, as well as additional control variables. 
In Panel C of Table 8 we report our ﬁndings ﬁrst without, and then with interacted Connectedness.  The statistically
signiﬁcant coefﬁcients do indeed suggest that measures of directional trade are stronger predictors of future returns among
ﬁrms with more intangible assets; the estimated coefﬁcients on the interaction between the informed trading variable and
asset tangibility are 1. 289 (t¼3. 31) for Short Interest and  0. 189 (t¼  1. 91) for Institutional OIB.  However, the return predictability of trading activity by sophisticated investors remains higher among ﬁrms with more connected boards even after
accounting for the role of asset tangibility: the estimated coefﬁcients on the interaction between the informed trading
variable and Connectedness are  0. 386 (t¼  2. 92) for Short Interest,  0. 468 (t¼  2. 74) for Option/Stock volume, and 0. 093
(t¼1. 96) for Institutional OIB.  In an additional untabulated analysis, we replace asset tangibility with the book-to-market ratio
and verify that our inference remains unchanged. Insider trading
Insider trading predicts future ﬁrm performance (see Cohen Name, 2012, for a recent review) and sophisticated traders
use information contained in insider trades (Engelberg Name, 2012).  If board Connectedness simply proxies for the level of
insider trading, our results could be due to traders' superior ability to gather information contained in insider trading
activity.
