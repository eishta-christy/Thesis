China’s excess air pollution is widely known.  In 2014, for example,
annual ﬁne particulate (PM2. 5) levels in 31 Chinese major cities (4
province-level cities and 27 provincial capitals) were 23-124 μg/m3,
with a mean of 65 μg/m3, exceeding the World Health Organization
(WHO) guideline level of 10 μg/m3 by a factor of N6 (Nam,
forthcoming).  As demonstrated by a substantial body of the epidemiological literature, conventional air pollutants, such as PM2. 5, increase
health risks substantially (Dockery Name, 1989, 1992.  Dockery and
Pope, 1994).  Given its excessiveness, air pollution in China has posed
enormous and imminent threats to the public health of urban residents. 
Many impact studies motivated to increase public awareness of the
threats have used such epidemiological evidence to estimate pollution-induced socioeconomic burdens.  A conventional approach ﬁrst keeps
track of the morbidity and mortality cases that occur due to exposure
to excess pollution, applying concentration-response functions, drawn
from the epidemiological literature, to given pollution levels.  Each case
is then valuated in monetary terms, using market or surveyed data for
each health endpoint.  A substantial number of China-focused studies
have adopted this approach, and their estimated pollution-health costs
range from 3. 5 to 5. 9% of China’s historic gross domestic product (GDP)
(see Section 4. 2). 
One potential problem in the literature is a lack of dynamic thinking
in economic valuation.  Many available estimates for China are based on a
static application of the conventional approach mentioned above, considering only a single point in time.  However, the effects of pollutioncaused damage may remain in an economy for a long time (Nam Name,
2010).  Labor loss in one period, for example, reduces incomes and savings, which will then lead to less investment and growth in the future. 
Also, increased demand for medical services can hardly be met without
drawing resources from other sectors, distorting cross-industry resource
allocation.  Distorted resource allocation due to an external shock
(i. e. , pollution) can reduce economy-wide efﬁciency over time, in a cumulative manner.  Neglecting such dynamic dimensions can lead to substantial underestimation. 
Other areas for improvement include a ﬁner unit of analysis and the
adoption of local epidemiological evidence.  Due to the lack of data, a dynamic impact analysis of China’s pollution is often conducted at the national level.  Given the substantial subnational heterogeneity in terms of
air quality or socioeconomic conditions, however, the disadvantage of
treating China as a single entity is substantial.  In addition, many studies
simply apply Western epidemiological evidence to China’s context, although a huge gap in background air quality may lead to different
exposure-response relationships between the two regions.  Accordingly,
it seems important to incorporate local epidemiological evidence, away
from direct application of Western estimates. 
In this study, we ﬁll the gap in the literature through application of a
dynamic assessment tool, following in the footstep of Matus Name (2012). 
The method developed in this study is distinct from others in that it can
capture cumulative dimensions of the pollution-health effects, which are
often overlooked in the literature, with subnational details.  We also focus
on PM2. 5, instead of PM10, given its closer relevance to human health, and
incorporate local epidemiological evidence to improve the accuracy of
our estimates. 
2.  Literature Review. 
A substantial body of literature has so far estimated pollution-health
effects in China’s context.  Among the pioneering studies on China is a
1997 study by the World Bank (World Bank, 1997).  This study estimates
that in 1995 the socioeconomic burden associated with PM10 pollution
was as large as 4. 6% of China’s historic GDP, even when its cumulative
dimension is ignored.  A follow-up World Bank study (World Bank and
SEPA, 2007) concludes that a comparable economic loss from PM10 pollution in 2003 was around 3. 8% of GDP, conﬁrming its earlier ﬁnding
and reﬂecting an improving air-quality trend in China.  In terms of method, these two studies take a static approach in impact estimation and a
contingent valuation method (CVM) in valuation of statistical life.  Many
other studies apply a similar static method, taking human capital (HC)
or cost of illness (COI) approaches, as well as a CVM (e. g. , Cai, 2009. 
Greenpeace and Peking University School of Public Health, 2015.  Kan
Name, 2004.  Mu and Zhang, 2013.  Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development, 2014.  Xie Name, 2016.  Gao Name,
2015.  Zeng Name, 2015.  Huang Name, 2012.  Hammitt and Zhou, 2006. 
Zhou Name, 2014.  Xu Name, 2015, 2016).  In general, those estimates
based on HC or COI methods tend to be smaller than CVM-based estimates, due to their restrictive focus on economic damage (Viscusi
Name, 2005). 
A key problem of the studies adopting a static approach is that they
tend to neglect cumulative dimensions of economic damage (Matus
Name, 2012).  Pollution-caused wage loss in one period, for example,
means a reduced pool of capital inputs available for growth in the following periods, and such effects remain in an economy for a long time
(Nam Name, 2010).  Also, increased exposure to pollution drives up the
demand for healthcare services, requiring an economy to allocate
more of the available intermediate or factor inputs toward the
healthcare sector at the expense of other sectors’ output (Matus Name,
2008).  Such distorted resource allocation caused by pollution likely
introduces economy-wide inefﬁciency, and this effect lasts beyond a
single time period.  Failure to consider these cumulative dimensions
can result in substantial underestimation of pollution-health costs
(Reilly Name, 2013). 
For this reason, more recent studies take a dynamic approach, often
employing computable general equilibrium (CGE) models (Bollena and
Brink, 2014.  Matus Name, 2012.  Nielsen and Ho, 2013.  Saari Name, 2015. 
Wu Name, 2017.  Xie Name, 2016).  With the explicit description of a
pollution-related production nest within a CGE framework, we can
trace cross-industry interactions and associated pollution-health
costs2, and the model’s dynamic application allows us to capture cumulative effects of economic damage over time, leading to a more complete
impact assessment (Boehringer and Rutherford, 2008.  Clarke Name,
2009.  Dai Name, 2017.  Yang Name, 2005.  Karplus Name, 2016.  Li Name,
2012.  Qi Name, 2014.  van Ruijven Name, 2012.  Zhang Name, 2013.  Zhu
Name, 2017.  G.  Wang Name, 2016.  X.  Wang Name, 2016).  Estimates
based on a dynamic approach tend to be greater than static estimates,
given their additional consideration of such missing dimensions in the
latter.  For example, Matus Name (2012) estimate that PM10-associated
health damage in 2005 reached 5. 9% of China’s GDP, which exceeds
the World Bank’s static estimate available for 2003 (3. 8%) by 2. 1 percentage point.  Part of this difference is due to the former’s more complete inclusion of cost dimensions, although a parallel comparison of
the two studies is hard, due to dissimilar time covered and methodological details (e. g. , assumption of PM10-related threshold effects). 
The latter group of studies, however, also present substantial room
for further improvement.  Most notably, China-focused dynamic analysis
often treats entire China as a single region, due to lack of reliable subnational data (e. g. , Matus Name, 2012).  This approach may not be reasonable, given China’s substantial subnational heterogeneity in terms of air
quality or socioeconomic conditions (Nam, forthcoming).  Another area
for improvement is incorporation of local epidemiological evidence.  Recently, a few studies have shifted toward regional CGE modeling, presenting substantial improvement in the ﬁrst aspect, but they still tend
to apply Western epidemiological evidence to China’s context (e. g. , Xie
Name, 2016).  This application neglects the possibility that a huge gap in
background air quality can lead to substantially different exposureresponse relationships in China and Western countries (Burnett Name,
2014).  In recognition of these problems, we conduct a dynamic
pollution-health effects analysis at subnational levels, incorporating
local epidemiological evidence. 
<Middle> Theoretical Framework and Method. 
Our dynamic analysis is based on the China Regional Energy Model
(CREM) extended for health-effects analysis (CREM-HE), developed as
part of the Regional Emissions Air-Quality Climate Health (REACH) assessment framework (Kishimoto Name, 2017.  Zhang Name, 2013. 
Karplus Name, 2016.  Luo Name, 2016).  Our method in detail is described3. 1.  REACH assessment framework. 
The REACH assessment framework is self-consistent and intends to
capture comprehensive energy-environment-economy dynamics in response to a policy shock.  This framework is a key product of the China
Energy and Climate Project, co-led by Tsinghua University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Zhang, 2016.  Kishimoto Name, 2017). 
As shown in Fig.  1, the following four components compose the REACH
framework.  an energy and economy model (CREM), an emission inventory module, an atmospheric chemistry transport model, and a healtheffects evaluation module.  In the ﬁgure, thin gray arrows indicate the
ﬂow variables among the components.  This framework can be applied
for various policy-driven cost-beneﬁt analyses at multiple levels, and
its spatial resolution can be easily increased by incorporating provincial
details of energy and economic systems and other spatial distribution
information, such as emissions and population. 
In response to a policy shock, CREM ﬁrst simulates economic growth,
energy use, and emissions pathways for each region.  Then, the air quality
modeling system, composed of a pollutant emissions inventory model
and a regional atmospheric chemistry model, uses CREM’s simulation
results to generate air-quality layers.  The pollutant emissions inventory
model, such as the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China
(MEIC) or the Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (REAS), can generate
detailed emission datasets by source and species, supporting climate and
air quality modeling at multiple spatial resolutions and time scales.  The
regional chemical transport model, such as the Community Multi-scale
Air Quality (CMAQ), translates emissions into concentrations, considering potential nonlinearity.  The air quality layers are then passed to the
CREM-HE model to conduct health effects analysis.  Implementing the
four modules in this order, we can mimic complex bidirectional feedback
loops between human and earth systems, and conduct a realistic
pollution-health effects analysis under various policy scenarios. 
For a complete employment of REACH model framework, we need to
conduct multi-iterations and obtain the solution when key parameters
converge to ﬁnite interval.  In this study, however, we conduct a counterfactual analysis of the past time periods (2007-2015), for which historic
air quality data already exist, and thus we do not need the ﬁrst three
steps explained above.  That is, we directly simulate CREM-HE under historic PM2. 5 levels and concentration-based policy targets, without translating emission-based targets into concentrations. 
3. 2.  CREM-HE. 
CREM is a multi-sector, multi-region, recursive dynamic CGE model,
where each province represents a separate region (Table 1).  CREM has
been used in conjunction with the China-in-Global Energy Model
(CGEM), to conduct a comprehensive impact assessment associated
with China’s national and subnational energy and climate polices
(Zhang Name, 2013, 2016.  Karplus Name, 2016.  Luo Name, 2016).  CREM consists of 35 regions in total, including 30 Chinese provinces and 5 international regions (Fig.  2).  The model has 15 sectors in total (13 production
and 2 consumption sectors), and its central economic data is from
China’s 2007 provincial input-output tables.  The 13 production sectors include ﬁve energy production sectors (coal, crude oil, natural gas, oil reﬁnery, and electricity and heat production), which have key importance in
China’s industrialization and urbanization processes.  Further technical details of the model are described in Zhang Name (2013) (see also Supplementary Material). 
In this study, we extend the standard version of CREM to assess
pollution-health effects, and call this extended version CREM-HE.  As
done in Matus Name (2008, 2012) and Nam Name (2010), air pollution is
introduced to the model as an economic shock, and the conventional social accounting matrix has been reconstructed to include the household
service sector, dedicated to mitigate the pollution-health effects (Fig.  3). 
Exposure to excess air pollution increases the incidence of morbidities
and mortalities.  Morbidities associated with pollution incur labor loss
and service costs for recovery from illness, and are modeled to drive up
the demand for the household services.  As the household services sector
draws labor and service inputs from other sectors for its production, increased output of the household services sector can be attained at the expense of reduced output of other sectors.  In addition to direct loss (lost
wage and medical expenditure required for recovery from illness), such
distortions in resource allocation causes inefﬁciency to an economy. 
Labor loss associated with mortalities is simply subtracted from the available pool of labor. 
Morbidities and mortalities also cause loss of leisure, but leisure does
not directly enter the economic system as a production factor (Fig.  4). 
Leisure, instead, is treated as potential labor input, as part of it can be
converted into labor hours.  Following conventional economic theory,
workers are assumed to value a unit leisure hour as much as a unit
labor hour, and they have a choice between them.  In this framework,
excessive pollution imposes both direct (i.
