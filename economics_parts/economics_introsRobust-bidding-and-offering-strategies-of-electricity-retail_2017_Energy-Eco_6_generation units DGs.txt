 1.  Introduction In order to supply end-user customers and determine optimum selling price for expected proﬁt maximization, uncertainty modeling of market price and demand should be done by retailer (Growe-Kuska et al. , 2003).  The retailer can determine the selling price based on ﬁxed price, time-of-use price or real-time price.  Finally, the retailer should prepare the curves for day-ahead market to purchase (sell) power from (to) the power market.  It should be noted that retailer can use the power market, bilateral contracts, self-dispatchable distributed generation units (DGs) and renewable energy sources (PV systems & wind turbines) to supply demand of customers.  But, sometimes it is possible that demand of customers is low.
