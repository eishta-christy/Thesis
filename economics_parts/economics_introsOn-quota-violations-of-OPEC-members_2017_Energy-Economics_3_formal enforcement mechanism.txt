 1.  Introduction OPEC has a fragile cartel structure.  It does not have a formal enforcement mechanism in place (except for the occasional price war) to incentivize its members to comply with their quota allocations (Alhajji and Huettner, 2000).  As a result, non-compliance to the quota has become a norm among OPEC members over the past decades.
