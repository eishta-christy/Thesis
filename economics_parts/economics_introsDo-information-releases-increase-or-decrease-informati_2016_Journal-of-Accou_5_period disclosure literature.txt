Information asymmetry between "sophisticated" and "unsophisticated" investors (hereafter referred to simply as
"information asymmetry") is a pervasive friction in capital markets (e. g.  Amihud and Mendelson, 1986; Easley and O'hara,
2004; Kim and Verrecchia, 1994; Leuz and Verrecchia, 2000). 1 In this study, we revisit a fundamental question in
information economics, which has implications for both accounting and ﬁnance—what effect does the public release of ﬁrmspeciﬁc information into the market environment (hereafter referred to as a “information release”) have on information
asymmetry in a short window around the announcement event. 
Whereas public information releases of all types generally decrease information asymmetry in the post-announcement
period relative to the pre-announcement period, disclosure literature theorizes that the net effect of a given information
release on information asymmetry at announcement depends on the relative strengths of two countervailing forces that
exist simultaneously in any given information release (e. g.
