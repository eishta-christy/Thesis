The auditor's report is the primary channel through which auditors communicate with financial statement users
information discovered during the auditing process.  Financial analysts and regulators have criticized the existing auditor's
reporting model as having little communicative value, and additional disclosures have been proposed to enhance the value
of the audit report (Church Name, 2008; PCAOB, 2013).
