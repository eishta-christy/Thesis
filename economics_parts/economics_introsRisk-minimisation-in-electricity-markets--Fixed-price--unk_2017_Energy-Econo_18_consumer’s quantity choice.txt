 1.  Introduction 1. 1.  The problem.  A popular product sold by energy companies to medium-to-large customers is one where an unspeciﬁed amount of power can be bought at a ﬁxed price during a certain time-interval.  We call this a ﬁxed price, unspeciﬁed consumption contract or simply a ﬁxed price agreement.  The business-to-business electricity market in Denmark in 2014 was 23. 1 TWh, about MEUR 800 million in monetary terms.  60% was sold as ﬁxed price agreements in some form.  Having entered into the ﬁxed price agreement, the energy company must asses and manage the risks associated with the obligations of the contract.  This is challenging for several reasons.  If the seller faced only the risk from price-ﬂuctuations, he could simply buy forward contracts to set up a full, perfect hedge.  However, with a criterion function that takes into account both (expected) gains and losses, this is expensive if forward-prices are typically above expected future spot-prices.  This so-called contango is the norm in Nordic power markets, as demonstrated by both Botterud et al.  (2002) and our analysis in Section 5. 1.  Another complicating factor is quantity risk.  If the consumer’s quantity choice were all-or-nothing, the contract would have payoff akin to call options.  Handling that would require modelling the price randomness of the electricity market which has several characteristics that are different from standard ﬁnancial markets such as stocks and exchange rates.
