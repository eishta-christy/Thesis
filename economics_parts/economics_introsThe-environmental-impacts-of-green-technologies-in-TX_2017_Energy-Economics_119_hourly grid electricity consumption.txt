 1.  Introduction Being “green” has become much easier for households with the evolution of technology, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and solar photovoltaic (PV) panels.  These technologies allow consumers to maintain a traditional lifestyle while also reducing their environmental impact by reducing fossil-fuel consumption either on the electricity grid or from internal combustion vehicles.  Governments recognize the environmental beneﬁts of these technologies and thus have implemented myriad policies to spur their deployment.  However, the question remains as to what degree these technologies improve environmental outcomes as they depend on multiple complex factors including the time- and location-speciﬁc emission characteristics of the electricity generation displaced by solar PV or consumed by EVs.  For example, an EV's environmental impact will depend on when and where the customer charges it.  Similarly, the environmental impact of a household's solar PV system will vary depending on the type of generation from the electricity grid that is displaced.  The temporal and spatial variation of these technologies' environmental impacts means that households can inﬂuence the magnitude of environmental beneﬁts by engaging in certain behaviors associated with these technologies.  Utilizing household energy consumption and generation data from the Mueller residential neighborhood in Austin, TX and hourly generation data for the Texas electricity grid, we analyze how household solar PV and EV utilization patterns impact the CO2 emissions and water consumption associated with consuming electricity from the grid.  We then explore how the use of these technologies can be adjusted to maximize environmental beneﬁts and whether these optimizing actions are indeed being taken.  Though several papers have investigated the environmental and electric system impacts of EVs (see Hadley and Tsvetkova, 2009.  Doucette and McCulloch, 2011.  Holland et al. , 2016.  Huo et al. , 2015.  Rangaraju et al. , 2015) or solar PV (Spiegel et al. , 2000.  Connors et al. , 2004.  Sivaraman and Keoleian, 2010.  Zhai et al. , 2012), our paper's detailed, hourly household level dataset on energy consumption, PV generation, and EV charging ﬁlls several gaps in the literature.  First, it allows us to identify hourly environmental impacts from actual charging patterns and identify whether households are charging during environmentally friendly times of day.  Second, we are able to estimate the magnitude and existence of a solar rebound effect, and whether this rebound effect varies with EV ownership.  Third, we can identify whether households are making environmentally optimal decisions with respect to these technologies.  Though many engineering papers have been written on how to maximize solar capture through panel tilt and orientation (see for example Li and Lam, 2007.  Zhao et al. , 2010.  Lave and Kleissl, 2011.  Hong et al. , 2014), to the best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst paper to estimate the environmental impact of solar panel orientation based on the marginal emissions proﬁle of the system.  Our use of a marginal (rather than average) emissions analysis also allows us to more accurately measure the environmental impact of the timing of charging and distributed generation.  Thus, our detailed dataset and carefully constructed emissions analysis contributes a robust and disaggregated analysis to the growing literature on the environmental impacts of green technologies.  2.  Environmental impacts of electricity.  2. 1.  Emissions and water consumption of electricity generation.  Generating electricity causes many types of environmental impacts.  In the United States, electricity is predominantly generated through the combustion of fossil fuels (EIA, 2016a).  Fossil fuel ﬁred electricity generators emit many local air pollutants, such as NOx, SO2, and particulate matter, causing air quality effects in adjacent areas.  These generators are also a signiﬁcant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Nationally, electricity generation is responsible for almost 40% of annual US CO2 emissions (EIA, 2016b).  Fossil fuel based electricity generation is also a water intensive process.  In 2015 over 1 trillion gallons of water were consumed for cooling during the production of electricity in the United States (EIA, 2015).  Fig.  1 shows how many gallons of water are used in Texas for each MWh of electricity generated by generation source.  renewables only utilize a negligible amount of water in producing electricity.  Generally, power plants withdraw water from a nearby surface source (e. g.  river, lake, or coastal water).  Most of the water is returned to the body of water.  however, some may evaporate or otherwise not be returned to its original source.  This water is considered to be consumed.  Thus, the water impacts of electricity generation can be measured by both the withdrawal and consumption of water.  These two water impacts are very different, and each type of generator may withdraw and consume a different amount of water.  For example, natural gas combustion turbine generators do not require water for cooling, whereas natural gas or coal steam turbine generators must use large amounts of water to condense steam and thus have greater water withdrawal and consumption levels.  Withdrawing large quantities of water is problematic for two reasons.  it displaces water for other uses, such as drinking, and the water that is returned to nature may be heated, causing local concerns in terms of water quality.  However, for purposes of this article, we reduce the scope of our analysis to the amount of water consumed, rather than withdrawn. 1 It is also important to note that most generators do not pay for using this water, due to its extraction from a body of water rather than using piped water.  Thus, there exists a negative externality associated with water extraction and consumption for electricity generation that is currently unpriced.  2. 2.  The time- and location-varying environmental impacts of grid electricity consumption.  While the environmental impacts of electricity generation are fairly straightforward in terms of emissions and water consumption, the environmental impacts attributable to electricity consumption are more complex particularly when electricity is consumed from an electric grid with multiple generators.  An electric grid must be coordinated by a balancing authority (e. g.  independent system operator or regional transmission operator) to match electric supply and demand in real time.  To keep generation costs low, the balancing authority will generally dispatch the generators with the lowest marginal cost ﬁrst.  As demand increases, more expensive generators are dispatched with the most expensive generators called upon at times of maximum peak demand.  Additionally, when non-dispatchable generation like solar or wind ﬂuctuate, various dispatchable generators such as coal and natural gas power plants must increase or decrease generation, accordingly.  For these reasons, the environmental impact of grid electricity consumption at any point in time is a function of the generator that responds to the change in electricity demand at that point in time (i. e. , the marginal generator).  Any change in demand will change the environmental impact at the marginal generator's rate of emissions and water consumption.  this is referred to as the marginal emission and consumption rate.  These rates can ﬂuctuate as different generators with different emission characteristics operate on the margin.  Often, data on marginal emission rates are unavailable for particular areas or time periods, and studies will utilize daily or yearly average emission rates to estimate emission impacts of different grid usage patterns.  The use of average emission rates, however, may bias emission impact estimates, as not all generators in a system will respond proportionally to a change in demand.  In fact, many studies have found instances of over- or under-estimation of emission impacts when average emission rates are used (Novan, 2011.  Kafﬁne et al. , 2013.  Jacobson and High, 2010).  Speciﬁcally, in the ERCOT region, Holland et al.  (2016) ﬁnd that CO2 emissions are overestimated by 19% when using an average rather than a marginal emissions methodology.  Marginal generators are almost always dispatchable generators—ones that can be ramped up or down in response to a change in demand.  Renewable generation such as wind or solar almost never act on the margin as they cannot be ramped up and can only under certain occasions be curtailed. 2 Instead, if these renewables increase simultaneously with demand, other dispatchable resources can be curtailed.  Kafﬁne et al.  (2013) ﬁnd that the intermittency of wind generation leads to an increased use of natural gas during high demand times, and a cycling of coal during low demand times (when natural gas generation is less This paper focuses on Austin Energy's grid in Texas, whose independent system operator (ISO), the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), manages the ﬂow of electricity and the wholesale market.  Natural gas and coal have dominated the ERCOT generation mix from 2013 to 2015, with the share of natural gas increasing over the years and displacing some coal generation (see ERCOT 2013, 2014, 2015).  Wind comprises about 11% of total generation in each year, but it generates much more during the night than during the day.  Fig.  2 plots the average hourly wind generation and load over the course of 2014 in the ERCOT region.  As can be seen in the ﬁgure, wind provides approximately 14% of the average load during the evening, but only about 7% in the middle of the day.  Because wind is clean and does not consume or withdraw water, it is a great generation source in terms of environmental impact.  However, it is important to keep in mind that any action that increases load during times of high wind generation (i. e. , night) will not affect the amount of wind that is generated (though it could reduce the amount of wind curtailment during moments of very high wind generation, particularly in places that are located outside of the transmission constraint, near the wind generators, or on the Western side of TX4).  Instead, it will require an increase in the generation of a dispatchable resource, such as natural gas or coal.  Ensuring that these dispatchable generators are as clean as possible will help reduce environmental impacts from any actions that increase the demand for centralized electricity generation (such as electric vehicle charging).  This also speaks to the importance of relying on marginal rather than average analyses.  By relying only on average analyses, a larger percentage of wind will appear to make EVs more beneﬁcial for emissions reductions.  however, if charging occurs when coal is on the margin, the environmental beneﬁt of this charging pattern is signiﬁcantly decreased if not totally negated.  Our usage of a marginal analysis therefore will better represent the environmental impacts of charging EVs at different times of day.  <Middle> Data.  3. 1.  Pecan Street Inc.
