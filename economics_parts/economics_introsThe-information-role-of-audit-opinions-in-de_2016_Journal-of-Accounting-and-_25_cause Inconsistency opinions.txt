The auditor's report is the primary channel through which auditors communicate with financial statement users
information discovered during the auditing process.  Financial analysts and regulators have criticized the existing auditor's
reporting model as having little communicative value, and additional disclosures have been proposed to enhance the value
of the audit report (Church Name, 2008; PCAOB, 2013). 1 Under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement
and Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), the auditor's reporting options are to issue either an unqualified opinion
or an unqualified opinion with explanatory language, commonly called a modified audit opinion (MAO). 2 This inclusion of
discretionary explanatory language, such as citing a lack of accounting consistency, emphasizing a material uncertainty, or
expressing a going concern (GC) opinion, is the only difference between a standard clean opinion and an MAO. 3 In fact, an
MAO is the sole way for auditors to communicate audit-specific information to outsiders. 4 There is still debate, however,
about the extent to which the auditor's report communicates relevant information to financial statement users (Church
Name, 2008; DeFond and Zhang, 2014).  In this study, we empirically investigate the relevance of MAOs in private debt
contracting. 
A large portion of the prior research that studied modified opinions focuses on the market reaction to the auditor's report
and provides evidence that equity investors react negatively to the issuance of a nonstandard opinion, especially to a GC
opinion (e. g.  Loudder Name, 1992; Fleak and Wilson, 1994; Menon and Williams, 2010).  We investigate the relevance of
auditor reporting from the perspective of debtholders for several reasons.  First, accounting information is often a direct
input in debt contracting; for example, debt covenants may rely on accounting numbers to monitor firm performance.  If an
MAO indicates low financial reporting quality, lenders will change the relative use of accounting-based covenants and
general covenants in loans issued after MAOs.  Second, debt contracts provide multi-dimensional information about
borrowers; loan contracts allow us to investigate the effects of audit opinions on both price and non-price costs of debt,
including loan covenants, loan size, loan maturity, and collateral requirements.  Finally, debtholders, whose payoffs are
concave in relation to firm value, demand a timely shift of control rights in order to discipline managers in the case of poor
firm performance (Dewatripont and Tirole, 1994; Ball Name, 2008).  This implies that debtholders should react to information
in MAOs for both pricing and monitoring purposes, because MAOs are likely to communicate negative news about clients’
financial reporting quality and credit worthiness.  Thus, examining lenders’ responses to MAOs can enhance our
understanding of the usefulness of auditor reporting. 
Lenders are likely to find the audit report relevant and useful in two ways.  First, through the audit opinion and associated
explanatory language, the auditor communicates information about the quality of financial reports for debt contracting
purposes.  The relevance of MAOs in debt contracting depends on the severity of the auditor's concern as expressed in the
explanatory language.  Second, MAOs communicate private information about clients’ credit risk to lenders that is not
available elsewhere.  Therefore, we expect the relevance of MAOs to lenders varies with the risks conveyed in the MAO. 
To analyze the relevance of MAOs in debt contracting, we first categorize audit opinions into clean and modified
opinions.  If an MAO indicates low financial reporting quality and potential credit risk, we predict that loans issued to firms
after an MAO will be associated with a higher cost of debt, reflected across different contract terms.  To examine the
incremental relevance of explanatory language, we classify MAOs into two general types, which we further partition into
four groups by their cause: Inconsistency opinions are caused by an Accounting Change or a Restatement; and Inadequacy
opinions are caused by Material Uncertainty or a GC Opinion. 5 MAOs issued because of an accounting Inconsistency alert
financial statement users about the incomparability of data contained in the financial statements.
