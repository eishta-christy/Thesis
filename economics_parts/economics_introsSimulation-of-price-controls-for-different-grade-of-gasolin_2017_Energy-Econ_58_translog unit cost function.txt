The essence of the gasoline subsidy policy problem is its inefﬁciency. 
The policy leads to overconsumption of gasoline since a subsidy drives
consumers to purchase a good at a price that is cheaper than the cost
of producing it (Harvey and Gayer, 2013).  Overconsumption also leads
to negative externalities such as emission of local pollutants, trafﬁc
congestions and accidents (Davis, 2014).  In the case of Indonesia, the
problem is further aggravated by the fact that the government only
provides a subsidy for regular gasoline, the lowest grade gasoline. 
Malaysia and Egypt implemented a similar policy that only deregulates
the higher grade of gasoline (Kojima, 2013).  Indonesia started off in the
1960s with only the national oil company, Pertamina, allowed in the
domestic gasoline market.  There was only one grade of gasoline, and it
was subsidized in the form of underpricing as the price was signiﬁcantly
lower than the world market price.  Gasoline was subsidized as a way to
protect people from the effects of inﬂation (Beaton and Lonton, 2010). 
In 2001, a new regulation was introduced by the government that
opened up the domestic gasoline market to multinational oil companies
but only for high-octane gasoline.  This was done to combat the 1997
Asian ﬁnancial crisis.  Regular gasoline was left subsidized.  Such a
scheme violates Ramsey's tax rule that taxing rival commodities should
leave the consumer's relative choices unaltered (Ramsey, 1927).  Different tax rates on commodities and factors introduce a distortion between
the marginal rate of substitution and the marginal rate of transformation (Stiglitz and Dasgupta, 1971).  In addition, Ito and Sallee (2014)
found that taxation based on different characteristics of automobiles
caused distortions in that market.  Similarly, the Indonesian subsidy
policy distorts both the regular and premium grade gasoline market. 
Another issue is the unequal beneﬁt of the policy (del Granado Name,
2012).  As consumers purchase more regular gasoline, the government's
expenditure on the subsidy increases signiﬁcantly while income
distribution is distorted as high-income consumers that purchase a
higher amount of regular gasoline, receive more beneﬁt (Pradiptyo
and Sahadewo, 2012). 
An obvious exit strategy from such undesirable outcomes is to
eliminate the subsidy.  However, the government is reluctant to take
this option because of its anticipated impact on consumer's welfare
and the political repercussions.  A lot of studies have been done to
analyze the economic impact of phasing out a gasoline subsidy in
Indonesia.  Adam and Lestari (2008) estimated that an increase in the
price of oil correlates negatively with households' welfare.  Clements
Name (2007) showed that removing the subsidy increases aggregate
price levels and reduces real output, while Dartanto (2013) found
that there will be an increase of poverty.  Arguably, these outcomes
might agitate the people and cause a signiﬁcant drop in the
government's popularity.  Furthermore, a well-known economist in
Indonesia said that removing the gasoline subsidy is against the constitution of Indonesia (Gie, 2011).  Although since late 2014 the price of
crude oil has dropped signiﬁcantly and saved billions ofgovernment's budget without any interference to the policy, the government remains cautious and had not fully deregulates the regular
gasoline market. 
The fuel subsidy took about 15% of overall government expenditure
in 2014 as shown in Fig.  1.  It amounts to about 250 trillion rupiahs or
around 20 billion USD (1 USD = Rp 12,000).  Based on Indonesia's
annual state budget, N80% is for gasoline, diesel and kerosene with
gasoline being the highest portion.  The government is aware of the
large cost of the policy but it has remained hesitant to act because of
the risk of being overthrown by the political opposition and strong
public resistance.  Numerous times the government had tried to cut
the subsidy but retreated when met with public protests (Quiano,
2012.  Cochrane, 2013).  In December 2014, the government announced
that the gasoline subsidy will be removed from the state's budget
starting in 2015 (Sari, 2014).  It was met with relatively manageable
public protest because in the process, the price of regular gasoline was
relatively unchanged.  However, the government did not fully deregulate the regular gasoline market since the price is still being set by the
government and only Pertamina is given the license to sell. 
Another alternative is to reduce the distortion in the regular gasoline
market while leaving the subsidy intact.  Using Ramsey's rule, the
government should aim to steer the consumer's choice back to a nonsubsidy pattern.  We show this can be achieved by decreasing the price
of premium gasoline, which means that the government should also
subsidize premium gasoline.  However, if the new subsidy on premium
gasoline is at the same rate as the current subsidy on regular gasoline,
the government's expenditure will increase signiﬁcantly.  Thus, the
rate of the new subsidy has to be lower than the current subsidy but
large enough to generate savings for the government. 
We have not found other studies that consider the revenue or welfare effects of this somewhat counter intuitive policy.  Thus, the contribution of this paper is to analyze this unique policy with a smaller
subsidy for premium gasoline that could potentially reduce gasoline
subsidy expenditures without the political backlash.  Arguably, subsidy
reform is difﬁcult to enact because of the effect on purchasing power
of the people and the resulting political instability.  By implementing a
different pricing policy for different grades of gasoline, the issue of
inﬂation and political instability can be avoided.  In addition, there has
yet to be any studies that focus on the inefﬁciency in the market for
different grades of gasoline.  Policy makers should be aware of the
issue of inefﬁciency resulted in the markets for substitutes.  The model
developed in this paper can also be used in other countries that plan
to improve either their gasoline subsidy or tax. 
The chosen subsidy rate will depend on the elasticities of demand
for gasoline.  We predict that the substitutability of gasolines with
different grades is what drives the magnitude of the savings.  However, we have found no literature on the own and cross-price elasticity
for regular and premium gasoline for Indonesia.  Nor were our attempts to obtain Indonesian data successful.  Therefore, we set up a
simulation experiment with differential subsidies for premium
gasoline by benchmarking to Indonesian data using the elasticities
estimated by Akimaya (2017) for Mexico, to our knowledge the only
existing study on the cross-price elasticity of gasoline by grade.  We
assume that the market has a perfectly elastic supply and only
consumer welfare is analyzed.  Various simulations using different
values for cross-price elasticity are done to determine whether there
are cross-price elasticities that generate savings.  Also, it has to be
noted that the new subsidy will distort the premium gasoline market. 
There will be a welfare effect in both the regular and premium
gasoline market. 
In the next section, the mathematical model to prove the existence
of a potential reduction in gasoline subsidy expenditure is analyzed.  In
Section 3, the data is presented followed in Section 4 by the calibration
process of Rutherford's (2002), which uses a translog unit cost function
to calibrate the derived demand functions.  The necessary parameters
for calibration are then presented in Section 5.
