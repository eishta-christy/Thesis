How ﬁrms disseminate information to ﬁnancial markets, how the market responds to this information, and how the
mechanism of information dissemination affects the market response are of great importance (e. g. , Grossman and Stiglitz,
1980; Merton, 1987).  Perhaps the most common and most important vehicle by which ﬁrms release information to the
market is through their earnings announcements.  In particular, one of the decision variables is the exact timing of the
earnings release.  If the timing of the release affects the market's response to ﬁrms’ earnings, then ﬁrms may release news
strategically, for instance, to hide bad news.  Prior studies examining the choice of weekday and, separately, time during the
day for earnings announcements show that there is a higher concentration of bad news on Friday than on other weekdays
(Penman, 1987; Damodaran, 1989; DellaVigna and Pollet, 2009; Doyle and Magilke, 2009; deHaan, Shevlin, and Thornock,
2015) and in the evening (after trading hours) than at other times of day (Patell and Wolfson, 1982; Doyle and Magilke,
2009; deHaan Name, 2015).  Recent studies have recognized that the mere concentration of bad news on Friday and in the
evening is not sufﬁcient to establish the existence of strategic announcement timing.  Doyle and Magilke consider opportunistic announcement switching and ﬁnd no evidence that managers switch announcements of bad earnings news to
Friday or evening.  deHaan, Shevlin, and Thornock analyze variation in investor attention and ﬁnd evidence consistent with
rational strategic announcing in the evening but not on Friday.
