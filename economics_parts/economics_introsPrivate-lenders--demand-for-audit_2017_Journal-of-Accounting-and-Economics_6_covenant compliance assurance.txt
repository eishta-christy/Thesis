Accounting covenants are widely used in private lending agreements to mitigate conﬂicts of interest between shareholders and lenders.  These covenants increase contracting eﬃciency by providing the basis for the optimal allocation of control 
rights when contracts are incomplete ( Watts and Zimmerman, 1986; Roberts and Suﬁ, 2009a; Christensen and Nikolaev,

agreements under GAAP.  In particular, accounting and auditing standards require auditors to conﬁrm the going concern assumption and to ensure the appropriate classiﬁcation of debt as current or non-current, which entails checking covenant 
compliance.  In addition to these standard obligations to verify compliance, however, auditors may offer a letter providing 
speciﬁc negative assurance directly to lenders by certifying that they have no knowledge of any default.  What is unclear 
is whether this additional covenant compliance assurance occurs at random, or whether it can be explained by eﬃcient 
contracting.  To date, the literature has been largely silent on the conditions under which lenders seek such assurance from 
auditors.
