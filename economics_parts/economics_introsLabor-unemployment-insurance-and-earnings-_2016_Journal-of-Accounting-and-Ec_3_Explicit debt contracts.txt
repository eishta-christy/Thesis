Understanding the forces that shape financial reporting outcomes is an important goal in accounting research.  A large
prior literature provides evidence on how financial reporting choices are affected by explicit and implicit contracts.  Explicit
debt contracts with firms’ creditors (Watts and Zimmerman, 1986; DeFond and Jiambalvo, 1994; Dichev and Skinner, 2002),
and compensation contracts with firms’ executives (Healy, 1985), have been shown to influence financial reporting choices. 
Implicit contracts with equity investors as reflected in these investors’ expectations have also been shown to influence
financial reporting choices (Graham Name, 2005; Badertscher Name, 2012).
