 1.  Introduction Accelerated economic growth over the past decades due to a globalized ﬂow of people and goods has substantially increased airlines' energy costs and CO2 emissions.  According to statistical data of the International Air Transport Association (IATA, 2015), in 2012, the total energy cost for airlines was N160 billion dollars, measured on a worldwide base.  Besides, the CO2 emission volume was N0. 676 billion tons at that time.  In fact, the aviation industry is one of the few sectors where energy consumption has increased at a rate of N6% over the past 10 years.  This research focuses on the technical efﬁciency of Chinese airlines by using a novel SNDEA model for network and ﬂight efﬁciency, built upon multivariate copulas and capable of handling undesirable outputs such as CO2 emissions and ﬂight delays.  It is important to mention now to readers the distinctive nature of the word “network” that appears in this research.  It appears both as the descriptor of the modeling approach adopted – Network DEA, for a productive process that encompasses several sequential stages – and as the name of one of the productive stages modeled within the ambit of the airlines' operation – network efﬁciency, for an airline that efﬁciently converts physical and human resources into landings and take-offs with minimal delays.  Previous research on airlines have adopted to use several methods such as (i) factor productivity approach (Bauer, 1990.  Oum and Yu, 1995.  Barbot et al. , 2008).  (ii) Stochastic Frontier Analysis or SFA models (Good et al. , 1993.  Baltagi et al. , 1995.  Tsionas et al. , 2017).  (iii) Turnquist total factor productivity index (Coelli et al. , 2003.  Barbot et al. , 2008).  (iv) Data Envelopment Analysis or DEA models (Merkert and Hensher, 2011.  Barros et al. , 2013.  Barros and Peypoch, 2009.  Barros and Couto, 2013.  Cao et al. , 2015.  Li et al. , 2015.  Wanke and Barros, 2016.  Cui and Li, 2017a, 2017b.  Zhang et al. , 2017).  and (v) multi-criteria decisionmaking models such as TOPSIS (Barros and Wanke, 2015.  Wanke et al. , 2015).  On the other hand, it is worth noting that, within the airline efﬁciency ambit, DEA-based studies are the most numerous when compared to the SFA-based methods and other minor approaches used (Wanke et al. , 2015.  Barros and Wanke, 2015.  Wanke and Barros, 2016.  Li and Cui, 2017.  Cui and Li, 2017a, 2017b).  This not only replicates a pattern that is found in papers focused on efﬁciency analysis in other industries such as ports and banking (e. g.  Wanke et al. , 2016a, 2016b), but may be also derived by the ﬂexibility provided by DEA models in modeling productive processes composed of two or more stages.  In fact, several different issues have been addressed by DEA-based airline research studies in different countries or regions.  Besides efﬁciency rankings and slack comparisons, it is possible to point out, for instance, that the impacts of network size, ownership, and regulatory measures on the performance of the airline industry have been addressed by regressing efﬁciency scores onto contextual or environmental variables (Barros et al. , 2013.  Barros and Wanke, 2015.  Cao et al. , 2015.  Li and Cui, 2017.  Cui and Li, 2017a, 2017b.  Zhang et al. , 2017).  Recent papers still maintain this focus (Wanke and Barros, 2016).  Readers should refer to these authors for a comprehensive literature review on this subject, which is synthesized in Appendix A with respect to the variables and methods used.  It is important to note, however, that only very recently, an increased focus on the energy/fuel efﬁciency of airlines is veriﬁed, although the treatment of CO2 emissions as an undesirable output is still scarce (Cui and Li, 2016, 2017a, 2017b.  Cui et al. , 2016.  Ko et al. , 2017).  For example, Babikian et al.  (2002) analyzed the fuel efﬁciency of different aircraft types and the results showed that fuel efﬁciency differences could be explained largely by differences in aircraft operations.  Morrell (2009) analyzed the potential for greater fuel efﬁciency by using larger aircraft and different operational patterns.  Miyoshi and Merkert (2010) evaluated the carbon and fuel efﬁciency of 14 European airlines during the period from 1986 to 2007 to understand the relationship between fuel efﬁciency and fuel price, distance ﬂown, and load factors.  Zou et al.  (2014) employed ratio-based, deterministic, and stochastic frontier approaches to investigate fuel efﬁciency of 15 large jet operators in the US.  The results showed that potential cost savings of mainline airlines could reach approximately 1 billion dollars in 2010.  Cui and Li (2015) applied a VFB-DEA to measure the energy efﬁciencies of 11 airlines from 2008 to 2012, and further they employed a dynamic Epsilon-Based Measure model to evaluate the dynamic efﬁciencies of 19 major international airlines from 2009 to 2014 (Cui and Li, 2017a).  They found out the global ﬁnancial crisis that broke out in 2008 has signiﬁcant negative effects on the airlines' energy efﬁciency.  Following the principle of CNG2020 strategy, Cui and Li (2017b) calculated the emission limit for each airline.  Two models, Network Range Adjusted Measure with natural disposability and Network Range Adjusted Measure with managerial disposability are proposed to discuss the efﬁciency change.  Yet, as regards the emerging research topics in airline efﬁciency, it is also important to note that the cross-impact of the quality of the services provided on airline efﬁciency is still understudied (Fan et al. , 2014).  To the best of our knowledge, as regards airline efﬁciency, only Wanke et al.  (2015) and Tsionas et al.  (2017) addressed the issue between quality of the services provided and technical efﬁciency within the ambit of the airline industry in Asia.  The authors found a positive, albeit weak, relationship between higher levels of service quality and efﬁciency.  This result may suggest the existence of a trade-in between operational/ ﬁnancial efﬁciency and service quality, different from the classical trade-off between efﬁciency and service where higher levels of service are obtained to the detriment of lower levels of efﬁciency.  An additional distinctive aspect of almost all these previously mentioned papers listed was their locus.  They mostly focused on airlines from the US (Barros et al. , 2013.  Greer, 2008.  Sjögren and Söderberg, 2011.  Evans and Schäfer, 2013.  Winchester et al. , 2015), Canada (Bauer, 1990.  Assaf, 2009), Europe (Distexhe and Perelman, 1994.  Greer, 2008.  Barros and Peypoch, 2009.  Pablo-Romero et al. , 2017), Asia (Baltagi et al. , 1995.  Wanke et al. , 2015), Africa (Barros and Wanke, 2015), and Latin America (Wanke and Barros, 2016).  Given the relative importance of China to the world economy, it is possible to afﬁrm that Chinese airlines consist of a relatively understudied topic in the academic ﬁeld.  As a matter of fact, only a few studies were devoted to this particular industry (Chow, 2010.  Wu et al. , 2013.  Cao et al. , 2015.  Wanke et al. , 2015.  Cui et al. , 2016.  Cui and Li, 2017a, 2017b.  Zhang et al. , 2017), without systematic analysis the energy efﬁciency as well as the service quality (Chai et al. , 2014.  Fan et al. , 2014.  Tsionas et al. , 2017).  Therefore, this paper builds upon the existing body of knowledge by presenting a novel SNDEA model for technical efﬁciency and undesirable outputs - like CO2 emissions and ﬂight delays - within the ambit of the Chinese airline industry.  Not only is China one of the fastest growing areas in the world, which justiﬁes the relevance of this study, but this paper also ﬁlls a literature gap by presenting and developing a model where overall airline efﬁciency is decomposed into network and ﬂight efﬁciency in light of multivariate random copulas to control for time (trend) and individual (DMU) effects.  Differently from previous researches, this paper presents several methodological innovations.  First of all, it is the ﬁrst time copulas are used within the ambit of NDEA models to bring up the stochastic aspects of inputs, outputs and intermediate variables uncertainty over the course of time and at the DMU level.  Second, this is the ﬁrst time that not only undesirable (CO2 emissions) and exogenous (delays) outputs are treated simultaneously in an airline efﬁciency study, but also that a trade-off is stablished between in them in terms of a non-cooperative game approach within the ambit of the NDEA modeling.  Third, to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time a robust regression approach involving three well-known techniques – Tobit, Beta, and Simplex – is developed and applied to solve such problem.
