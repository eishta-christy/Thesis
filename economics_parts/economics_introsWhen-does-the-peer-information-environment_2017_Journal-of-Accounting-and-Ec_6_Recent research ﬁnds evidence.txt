an industry affects the cost of capital for other ﬁrms in the industry.  We predict and ﬁnd 
that the peer information environment is negatively associated with a ﬁrm’s cost of capital 
when there is less publicly available ﬁrm-speciﬁc information and this negative association 
shrinks as the amount of ﬁrm-speciﬁc information increases.  This paper provides evidence 
that information about peer-ﬁrms has externalities on the cost of capital for related ﬁrms 
and that these externalities are time-varying.  
We examine whether the information environment of peer ﬁrms (henceforth, peer information) affects the cost of capital 
for related ﬁrms in an industry and whether the importance of this effect depends on the amount of information available 
directly from the related ﬁrm (henceforth, ﬁrm information).  Speciﬁcally, we hypothesize that peer information has a larger 
economic effect on a ﬁrm’s cost of capital when ﬁrm information is scarce, and that these externalities reduce when the 
amount of ﬁrm information increases and substitutes for peer information.  Recent research ﬁnds evidence that a ﬁrm’s
disclosure has important economic consequences for its peers.  For example, a ﬁrm’s disclosure inﬂuences peer ﬁrms’ (i) 
stock prices, (ii) stock liquidity, and (iii) investment decisions (e.
