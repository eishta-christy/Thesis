 1.  Introduction Aquaculture is the world's fastest growing food production technology, and in 2014 it surpassed wild ﬁsh as a source of seafood for human consumption (FAO, 2015).  However, aquaculture is also a controversial food production technology that constitutes a new way of using the environment, which creates new negative externalities (Naylor et al. , 2000).  This has led to a negative perception of aquaculture in many markets and several studies indicate a consumer preference for wild ﬁsh (Salladarré et al. , 2010.  Roheim et al. , 2012.  Uchida et al. , 2014a).  Recently, the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) introduced an ecolabel certifying that the production process for the labeled ﬁsh is environmentally sustainable.  Using survey data, this study investigates the effect of the ASC label for salmon, a popular species that is available as both wild and farmed in Germany.  If the ASC label has a positive effect, it is of particular interest whether this effect is large enough to negate the disadvantage of not being wild as well as how the ASC compares with ecolabels for wild ﬁsh such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) label.  Environmentally sustainable production processes for seafood initially focused on wild ﬁsh, as many ﬁsheries were perceived to be over-ﬁshed.  This has led to a number of sustainability schemes and ecolabels being implemented since the turn of the century (Roheim, 2008), with the MSC ecolabel being the most commonly used. 1 A number of studies using revealed or stated preference data show a positive preference and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for seafood with an ecolabel that guarantees an environmentally sustainable production process (Wessells et al. , 1999.  Johnston et al. , 2001.  Jaffry et al. , 2004.  Johnston and Roheim, 2006.  Brécard et al. , 2009.  Salladarré et al. , 2010.  Uchida et al. , 2014a, 2014b.  Fonner and Sylvia, 2015.  Rickertsen et al. , 2017).  In addition, studies using hedonic price functions indicate a positive premium for the ecolabel using scanner or store observation data (Roheim et al. , 2011.  Sogn-Grundvåg and Young, 2013.  Sogn-Grundvåg et al. , 2013, 2014, Asche et al. , 2015a.  Bronnmann and Asche, 2016).  Hence, the ecolabels seem to be successful in segmenting the seafood market into a higher paying sustainably ﬁshed market segment and a lower priced segment with no guarantees with respect to environmental sustainability.  Initially, aquaculture was regarded as a production technology that could reduce over-ﬁshing by reducing demand for and thereby ﬁshing effort for wild species. 2 In the 1990s, Anderson and Bettancourt (1993), Gu and Anderson (1995) and Holland and Wessells (1998) reported evidence of consumer preferences for farmed ﬁsh.  However, as aquaculture production increased, more attention was given to the negative environmental effects of the production process, and consumer attitudes have shifted to a preference for wild ﬁsh (Salladarré et al. , 2010.  Roheim et al. , 2012.  Uchida et al. , 2014a).  While this in itself constitutes a challenge for farmed seafood, the fact that aquaculture and wild seafood within a species group are highly substitutable contributes further to make the MSC label a challenge for farmed seafood. 3 There have been some attempts to mitigate this challenge by labeling farmed seafood as organic or using best practices labeling (Asche et al. , 2015a.  Ankamah-Yeboah et al. , 2016). 4 However, these are at best half-way measures since they are only imperfectly addressing the sustainability concern.  The lack of a serious ecolabel for farmed seafood has become more apparent as aquaculture production has continued to grow. 5 Moreover, despite environmental challenges in parts of the industry, it is hard to argue that all aquaculture production is unsustainable (Bush et al. , 2013a).  In 2012, the ASC ecolabel was created in cooperation with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which was also the case for the MSC ecolabel. 6 The ASC ecolabel allows ﬁsh farmers to indicate that their product is sustainably produced with a credible label, and can remove the potential market advantage the MSC ecolabel gave wild ﬁsh if the main reason for the preference for wild ﬁsh is environmental concerns.  This paper investigates the preferences of German consumers for salmon, with a particular focus on the attributes farmed, wild, and eco-labeled. 7 However, factors such as demographics and product form are controlled for.  As recent hedonic price function studies have shown the type of retail outlet to be important (Asche et al. , 2015a.
