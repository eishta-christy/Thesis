Human societies have always been dependent on material and energy use.  In recent time, however, the increasing level of per-capita consumption and the pressure generated by a rising world population
have increased the worldwide energy and material demand.  Based on
data provided by Arto Name (2012)and by the International Energy
Agency (IEA, 2015), the quantity of material extracted increased by
around 43% (between 1995 and 2007) and the world energy consumption by almost 100%, rising from 4666 Mtoe in 1973 to 9302 Mtoe in
2013.  Fossil fuels have been the main source of energy supply, accounting today for around 82% of the total energy use (World Bank, 2016). 
The consequent impact on resource availability, pollution and unequal
distribution of wealth are some of the main elements raising concerns
related to possible instabilities and crisis.  Over the last few decades, different models have been proposed to investigate the mutual relationships existing between the humans and the natural environment and
the concept of social metabolism has been proposed to investigate the
process of energy and material transformation taking place on societies
(Martinez-Alier, 1987.  Fischer-Kowalski, 1998).  Based on the idea that
the human environment is strictly dependent on the natural environment, the social metabolism analyses the energy and the material use
as fundamental elements for the maintenance and development of societies.  The main objective is to investigate how variation in energy, material and human time allocation can generate impact on both social
and environmental elements.  The Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) is an accounting framework speciﬁcally design to investigate the size, the allocation and the
human and natural dependencies of societies (Giampietro and
Mayumi, 1977, 2000).  By using the MuSIASEM approach, this paper
compares the metabolic proﬁle of 28 world countries in 1995 and
2007.  The main objective is to provide an overview of the variations
that have taken place and to investigate the main elements responsible
for changes.  The paper is structured as follow.  Section 2 introduces the
methodology.  Section 3 presents the study area and the data sources.  In
Section 4 the main results are reported and interpreted.  Section 5 includes discussion, future development and limitations.  Section 6
concludes. 
2.  Social Metabolism and MuSIASEM Methodology. 
The Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) has been proposed by Giampietro and Mayumi
(1977, 2000) based on the integration of various concepts related to
complex system theory (Prigogine, 1961, 1978.  Maturana and Valera,
1980.  Odum, 1971, 1983, 1996.  Ulanowicz, 1986, 1995.  Rosen, 1958,
2000.  Zipf, 1941.  Morowitz, 1979.  Kauffman, 1993.  Ahl and Allen,
1996.  Koestler, 1969) post-normal science (Funtowicz and Ravetz,
1994) and bioeconomics (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971, 1977) (for exhaustive descriptions please see Mayumi, 1999, Ramos-Martin Name, 2007
and Giampietro Name, 2009).  The main idea is to consider societies as
metabolic structures that use ﬂows and funds to sustain and expand.  According to the deﬁnition reported by Velasco-Fernandez Name (2015),
ﬂows are elements that enter into the system, as energy or material and
that are transformed by the socio-economic processes.  Funds are elements that are sustained by the ﬂows and that preserve their identity,
as for example capital or human time.  The way in which ﬂows and
funds are combined characterise the metabolic proﬁle of societies.  The
analysis of the relationships existing between energy, materials and
socio-economic variables, as human time, demography and economic
elements, provides information about the way in which societies evolve
and self-organise.  During the last decade, the MuSIASEM approach has
proven to be particularly useful to analyse how technological development and acceleration of energy and material use, generates changes
in the metabolic structure of societies.  The increasing use of exosomatic
energy, deﬁned as the non-human body energy source, has been related
to changes in demographic structure, economic activities, human time
allocation, social stability and environmental impacts (Mayumi, 1991. 
Falconi-Benitez, 2001.  Ramos-Martin, 2001.  Ramos-Martin and
Giampietro, 2005.  Eisenmenger Name, 2007.  Ramos-Martin Name,
2009.  Serrano-Tovar and Giampietro, 2014.  Velasco-Fernandez Name,
2015.  Ginard-Bosch and Ramos-Martin, 2016).  According to this approach, the accounting framework proposed by MuSIASEM is speciﬁcally designed to study biophysical and socioeconomic elements in an
integrated way (Giampietro and Bukkens, 2015).  The analysis of the interrelationships existing between them is useful to identify constraints
that can affect the evolution of the system as well as impacts that can
be generated both on the human and on the natural environment. 
Since the MuSIASEM approach recognises the idea that societies are
complex systems operating at different levels, the proposed accounting
framework includes different scales of analysis.  The objective is to investigate societies as a whole or disaggregated between activities.  The main
levels of analysis can be summarised as. 
▪ Level N consider the entire society. 
▪ Level N-1 disaggregates society between consumption and production activities, respectively deﬁned as household and paid sectors. 
The paid sector includes all the activities that are responsible for
value added generation.  The household sector includes the activities
related to value added consumption. 
▪ Level N-2 split the paid activities into different subsectors.  The economic sectors considered in this paper are reported Table 1. 
For every one of the three levels, the energy and the human time
constraints are investigated.  The mutual relationships existing between
them are also taken into account by considering that changes in one
level generates impacts in the other levels. 
Different variables and indicators have been proposed by the
MuSIASEM approach.  An overview is reported in Tables 2 and 3.  These
variables and indicators have been speciﬁcally designed to have a
multi-level and multi-dimensional structure.  The main objective is to
analyse both the characteristics of the different compartments of society
as well as to take into account the mutual relationships existing between them.  This multi-level descriptions, together with the inclusion
of quantitative information related to biophysical and socio-economic
elements provide an useful tool to investigate the complex relationships
and constraints existing between the human and the natural
environment. 
The MuSIASEM approach has proven to be an effective tool to analyse the characteristics of societies based on population, socioeconomic
constraints
(Velasco-Fernandez Name, 2015.  Giampietro and Bukkens, 2015).  By
using the accounting framework described above, the present paper
analyses the energy metabolism of 28 world countries in 1995 and
2007.  The results provide an overview of the development path of countries and can be used to support policy in the design of sustainable
environmental strategies. 
<Middle> Study Area and Data. 
The study area considered in this paper includes the 28 world countries reported in Table 4.  Fourteen of the countries have been classiﬁed
as western European countries, six countries as eastern European countries and the remaining eighth as extra European areas.  This selection of
countries has been mainly driven by consistency in data availability. 
Since the main objective was to provide an overview of the exosomatic
energy metabolism of different countries, only the areas with consistent
information across all the variables have been considered in this paper. 
For this reason, all the countries requiring alternative data sources have
been excluded. 
Based on this data consistency approach, the World Input-Output
Database (WIOD) has been used as the main data source for calculation. 
This database includes a set of socio-economic and environmental information for 40 world countries plus the Rest of the World (for a description of the database see Dietzenbacher Name, 2013).  The socio-economic
accounts included in WIOD provide consistent information on the number of hours worked by persons engaged (employees, self-employed
and family-workers), exosomatic energy and labour productivity for
all the 28 countries considered in this paper.  The socio-economic information provided by WIOD are also disaggregated according to the economic sectors reported in Table 1.  OECD data have been used for
population and GDP (US$ constant prices, constant PPP reference year
2005).  The World Input Output Database is suitable to be used to
investigate a large set of topics related to economy, society and environment.  In the past, it has for example been used to analyse the relationships between economic activities and environmental impacts (Arto
Name, 2012, 2014, 2016), to investigate the main drivers on energy use
(Andreoni and Galmarini, 2016) and to analyse topics related to global
value chain, globalisation and competitiveness (Timmer Name, 2013. 
Timmer Name, 2014.  Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare, 2014.  Los Name,
2015).  As far as I know, the present paper is the ﬁrst attempt to use
the WIOD database to analyse the metabolic proﬁle of societies. 
4.  Results. 
4. 1.  Level N – Country Level. 
The results presented in this section summarise the main variables
and indicators reported in Level N of Tables 1 and 2.  Based on country
level information, they provide an overview of the metabolic performance of the 28 countries considered in this paper.  Disaggregated
data for countries, variables and indicators are reported in Tables A. 1–
A. 9 of the appendix. 
According to data reported in Fig.  1 and in Table A. 1 of the appendix,
the total energy throughput (TET) increased for all the countries considered in this paper, ad exception of Great Britain and Sweden (−3. 0%
and −1. 1%, respectively).  In Great Britain, the reduction of the total energy consumption that has taken place in the paid sector (ETPW) (−
680,959 TJ) has driven the reduction of the total energy throughput,
while the energy consumed in the household sector (ETHH) increased
(+236,597 TJ) (Tables A. 3 and A. 4 of the appendix).  According to data
reported in Table A. 6 of the appendix, the energy throughput reduced
in the manufacturing (−15. 1%), in the construction (−15. 1%), in the
wholesale (−14. 1%), in the public administration (−43. 2%) and in
the education (−16. 2%) sectors.  However, the largest absolute variations have taken place in the manufacturing (−1. 004,989 TJ) and in
the public administration sectors (−74,272 TJ).  The reduction of activity of the heavy industry sub-sectors (iron and steel, non-ferrous metal,
mineral products and chemicals) and the improvements on the heating
system and insulation, that have taken place in public administration
sectors, have been the main elements inﬂuencing the reduction of the
total energy throughput (TET) (Department of Business, Energy and
Industrial Strategy, 2016).  In a similar way, the large investments devoted to reduce the energy consumption of buildings and the Swedish Energy Agency programme oriented to increase consumer's responsibility
have been the main factors responsible for the reduction of the total energy throughput (TET) of Sweden (IEA, 2013.  Vassileva, 2012).  In this
country, the household sector has been the main driver of the reduction
in the energy throughput (ETHH reduced by 9% between 1995 and
2007), while the energy used in the paid sector (ETPW) remained almost
unchanged (+0. 1%) (Tables A. 3 and A. 4 of the appendix). 
Between the years 1995 and 2007, the gross domestic product
(GDP) increased for all the countries considered in this paper.  The largest percentage variations have taken place in Ireland (+129. 5%), Korea
(+77. 3%), Russia (+71. 1%), Turkey (+71. 1%) and in the eastern
European countries that during the period considered joined the EU
(Estonia +131. 2%, Slovakia 79. 8%, Poland +71. 9%, Slovenia 67. 3%). 
The percentage increase of GDP has been higher than the percentage
variation of TET.  This trend is also summarised by the quantity of energy
used per unit of GDP (TET/GDP), that reduced for all the countries included in this paper.  According to data reported in Fig.  2 and in
Table A. 2 of the appendix, Russia (−38. 3%), Great Britain (−34. 4%),
Sweden (−32. 4%) and the eastern European countries, that joined the
EU during the period considered, performed the largest energy efﬁciency increases (Estonia −50. 2%, Slovakia, −39. 3%, Poland −39. 2%,
Slovenia −33. 2%, Czech Republic −30. 2% and Hungary −28. 5%).  The
technological transfer and the EU regulations, together with the externalisation of some of the most energy intensive activities and the increasing contribution of the ﬁnancial sector have been some of the
main factors contributing to reduce the quantity of energy use per
unit of GDP (Andreoni and Galmarini, 2016.  Fiorito, 2013).  Denmark
has been the only country with an energy intensity reduction lower
than 1% (−0. 7%).  As reported by Andreoni and Galmarini (2012) the
fuel switching that has taken place in the maritime transport sector,
has been the main factor inﬂuencing the low energy efﬁciency
improvement. 
According to data reported in Fig.  3 and in Table A. 1 of the appendix,
the percentage variation of the total human time (THA), that can be considered as a proxy of the population size, has been generally lower than
the percentage variation of the total energy throughput (TET).  These
data provide evidence that the total energy consumption increase has
not been driven by a population growth but it has been generated by
an overall per capita energy consumption increase.  The only exceptions
are Netherlands, where the total human time increased more than the
energy throughput (+6% and +4. 3%, respectively), Great Britain and
Sweden, that as reported above, reduced the total energy consumption
during the period considered in this paper.  To better investigate this evidence, the following section analyses the variation in the energy consumption for the household and for the paid sectors. 
4. 2.  Level N-1 – Household and Paid Sector Level. 
The analysis of the metabolic performance at national level can be
complemented by analysis at a lower scale.  The Level N-1 disaggregates
the human activities between household (HH) and paid sectors (PW). 
When analysing the performance of the household sector, particular attention needs to be devoted to the demographic structure of society.  According to data reported in Table A. 1 of the appendix, most of the
countries considered in this paper, ad exception of Russia and some of
the eastern European countries that joined the EU during the time period considered in this paper (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and
Poland) had a population increase (THA).  However, since the percentage variation of the time spent in the paid sectors (HAPW) has, in most
of the cases, been higher than the percentage variation of the population
(THA), the fraction HAPW/THA has increased (Table A. 4 of the appendix).  This means that the dependency ratio of the non-working and unemployed population decreased.  The only countries that increased the
dependency ratio have been Czech Republic, Germany, Japan, Korea,
Poland, Slovakia and Turkey.  On these countries, the percentage variation of HAPW has been lower than the population increase.  Aging population and outﬂow migration of working age citizens have been the
main factors affecting this trend.  Japan and Germany ranked as two of
the top three world aging population countries and Czech Republic
and Slovakia experienced large population outﬂow particular towards
western European countries (OECD website). 
In terms of energy throughput, twenty-one countries increased the
quantity of energy used in the household sector (ETHH) and nineteen
of them increased the energy used per unit of time (EMRHH) (Fig.  4
and Table A. 4 of the appendix).  According to Cleveland Name (1984),
Hall Name (1986), Pastore Name (2000), Giampietro Name (2011) and
Velasco-Fernandez Name (2015) a higher energy throughput per hour
of human activity in the household sector can be considered as a
proxy of the material standard of living.  Larger energy throughput can
be associated with more energy services and home appliances that usually increase the overall comfort of non-working time.  For the countries
that performed a negative variation of EMRHH (Austria, Belgium,
Germany, Finland, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovenia and Sweden),
the percentage change of the time spent in the household sector has
been higher than the percentage variation of the energy throughput
and for seven of the countries (Belgium, Germany, Netherlands,
Poland, Russia, Slovenia and Sweden) the energy consumed in the
household sector decreased. 
Based on data reported in Table A. 3 of the appendix, all the countries
considered in this paper, with exception of Great Britain, increased the
energy throughput of the paid sector (ETPW).  The largest variations
have taken place in Ireland (56. 4%), Korea (+54. 3%), Turkey (+53. 3),
and Greece (51. 4%).  Ireland, Korea and Greece, together with Spain,
also experienced some of the highest percentage variations of the energy throughput of the household sector (ETHH) (+58. 9%, +62. 3%,
+52. 5% and +64. 8%,
Industrial development,
mechanisation, increasing demand for electrical appliances and transports have been, according to EEA (2015), the main factors responsible
for the energy consumption increase.  In terms of exosomatic metabolic
rate of the paid sector (EMRPW), nineteen countries increased the
amount of energy consumed per hour of labour (with exception of
Australia, Canada, Spain, France, Great Britain, Mexico, Netherlands,
Sweden, USA) (Fig.  5).  The largest percentage variations have taken
place in Turkey (+65. 2%) and Korea (+47. 7%).  Based on data reported
in Table A. 5 the appendix, Turkey is the only country that increased the
exosomatic metabolic rate in all the twelve economic sectors reported
in Table 1.  For all of them, the percentage variation of the energy
used (ETPW) has been higher than the percentage variation of the
human time (HAPW) (Tables A. 6 and A. 7 of the appendix).  Following
Velasco-Fernandez Name (2015), the increase in the exosomatic metabolic rate of the paid sector (EMRPW) can be considered as a proxy
of the level of technical capitalisation.  An example of that is provided
by Korea that, by implementing a set of farm mechanisation plans,
largely reduced the number of working hours devoted to the agricultural sector (Choi and Kang, 2016).  Based on data reported in
Tables A. 6 and A. 7 of the appendix, between 1995 and 2007 the
HAPW of “agriculture, hunting, forestry, mining and quarrying” sector reduced by 35. 4% and the energy consumption increased by
46. 5%.  As a result, the exosomatic metabolic rate of this sector increased (Table A. 5 of the appendix). 
In terms of labour productivity (ELPPW), all the countries considered
in this paper increased the quantity of GDP produced per unit of working hour (Fig.  6).  The largest variations have taken place in eastern
European countries (Estonia +123. 6%.
