 1.  Introduction  Prior theoretical research posits that private lenders have comparative advantages over other debt market participants at  monitoring borrowers’ current and likely future compliance with ﬁnancial covenants and other loan contract terms (hereafter, “loan contract monitoring”) ( Diamond, 1984.  Fama, 1985.  Diamond, 1991 ).  Prior empirical research ﬁnds that commercial borrowers provide lenders with private information to facilitate loan contract monitoring ( Acharya and Johnson,  2007.  Bushman et al. , 2010.  Frankel et al. , 2011.  Ivashina and Sun, 2011, Massoud et al. , 2011.  Minnis and Sutherland, 2017 ).   However, with the notable exception of Minnis and Sutherland (2017) , these prior studies do not identify the speciﬁc mechanisms by which lenders obtain such information or types of information obtained.  This limits the insight provided about  how lenders obtain and use accounting-related borrower private information for monitoring, a natural question for accounting research.   We  examine  whether  lenders’  demand  for  information  for  loan  contract  monitoring  explains  the  existence  of  loan  covenants that commit borrowers to disclose accounting-related private information (hereafter, “borrower private information”) periodically after loan origination to lenders.  We also examine the effects of these covenants on the frequency of loan  contract amendments and on informed trading by lenders in secondary loan markets.
