The link between competition and innovation has been a very
active topic in industrial organization.  It goes back to the indirect
debate between Arrow (1962) and Schumpeter (1942) centering
around the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis, which brieﬂy stated
says that one should expect to observe an inverse relationship
between innovation and the intensity of competition or market
structure. 
On the one hand, there are several arguments supporting the
view that possession of market power should result in greater innovative activities (Schumpeter, 1942).  First, market power may be
extendable to new products, for example, through a dominant ﬁrm’s
command over channels of distribution, and so on.  With the ability
to extend market power to new products, an incumbent monopolist should ﬁnd innovation more attractive.  Second, there may be a
need to ﬁnance innovation internally, which puts ﬁrms with market power at an advantage since these ﬁrms may have supernormal
proﬁts.  Third, ﬁrms with current market power typically have more
resources and thus are more likely to hire the most innovative people.  Of course the third argument is related to the imperfect capital
market argument underlying the second reason.
