The last decade has seen increasing application of efﬁciency frontier
models taking the material1 balance principle (MBP) into account to
measure ﬁrm and regional level environmental performance and obtain
both environmental information and economic outcomes (Coelli Name,
2007.  Hoang and Coelli, 2011.  Reinhard Name, 2000).  The main acknowledged advantage of the MBP approach over other methods is that it is
founded upon on the Law of the Conservation of Matter (Lauwers,
2009).  According to this law, pollutant emissions from production activities are considered waste residuals (Ayres, 1995.  Ayres and Kneese,
1969.
