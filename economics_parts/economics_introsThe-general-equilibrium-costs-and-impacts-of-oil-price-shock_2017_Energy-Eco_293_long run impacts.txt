Oil consumption has risen over the last 50 years, as nations have become reliant on oil for daily activities such as home heating, industrial
processes and transportation (IEA, 2015).  There have historically been
few substitutes for oil, so oil prices and shocks to oil prices have had a
major impact on global economic activity (Brown and Yucel, 2002; He
Name, 2010).  High oil prices in the 1970s had adverse economic impacts
in the industrialized world, and contributed to low growth, high unemployment and high inﬂation (Blanchard and Gali, 2007).  This caused oil
importing nations to re-examine energy security, and resulted in movements towards energy efﬁciency and the development of alternative energy sources (Natural Resources Canada, 2012; Department of Energy and
Climate Change, 2012).  On the other hand, when oil prices drop, oil producing and exporting countries face a reduction in revenue streams
(U. S.  Energy Information Administration, 2016a, 2016b), which can
potentially lead to economic downturns. 
While oil prices were high for much of the early 2000s, prices declined
sharply in the summer of 2014 to levels that were less than half of their
2012 values (US EIA, 2016b).  The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) spot
price for crude oil was $105 per barrel as of July 2014 and by January
2015 it had dropped to 44 $/barrel.  Canada is a major player in the global
market for oil and gas; proven reserves in Canada are third in the world
after Venezuela and Saudia Arabia, while production and exports are
ﬁfth and fourth, respectively.  Further, the oil and gas sector accounted
for 7. 5% of Canadian GDP in 2013 (Natural Resources Canada, 2015). 
Given this dependence on the oil and gas sector, it is clear that shocks to
oil prices may have hard-hitting and potentially long-lasting effects on
the national economy.  With a lower value of Canadian production and exports, Canada suffers a loss of international purchasing power (Royal Bank
of Canada, 2014). 
In Canada, the oil and gas sector is especially predominant within the
provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador
(NL).  In NL, the Oil Extraction and Supporting Activities sector, comprised
primarily of the offshore oil ﬁelds Hibernia, Terra Nova, and White Rose, is
by far the largest individual contributor to GDP, responsible for approximately 30% of provincial GDP.  Provinces such as NL, which saw great beneﬁts from the rise of oil prices prior to the shock in the 2000s, have been
the hardest hit when prices drastically fell.  The shock to oil prices has resulted in increased unemployment, reduced production and GDP: “Production in oil and gas related industries declined by 8% between the
fourth quarters of 2014 and second quarter of 2015, while business
investment linked to these industries fell sharply” (Bank of Canada, 2015). 
In NL, preliminary estimates show that there has been a 2% drop in real
GDP since 2014, an expected decline in production by about 16% as of
2015 and an increase in unemployment by about 0. 6% in 2015
(Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, 2015a, 2015b).  Further,
the oil price drop has reduced government revenue (royalties); the NL
government receives a signiﬁcant portion of its provincial revenue
(33%) from the various royalty regimes associated with the offshore oil
extraction projects (Royal Bank of Canada, 2015). 
Understanding the impact of a major change in oil prices on factors
such as those described above can prove crucial for developing the
optimal policy responses in reaction to shifting prices.  Our goal is to
estimate the short run (5 year) and long run (30 year) economic costs
and impacts to NL from a drop in oil prices in the magnitude observed
in 2014.  To analyse this shock, we develop a dynamic Computable
General Equilibrium (CGE) Model that has been calibrated to the NL economy.  The model tracks important economic variables like production,
GDP, labour, investment, consumption and trade across 21 sectors up
until the year 2040.  CGE models can capture both direct impacts to the
oil and gas sector, as well as indirect and induced impacts in other sectors. 
Given the impact of oil price ﬂuctuations, many studies have examined the economic impact of oil price shocks since the 1970s (Pindyck
and Rotemberg, 1983; Kilian, 2008; Hooker, 1996; Jiménez-Rodríguez
and Sánchez, 2005; Blanchard and Gali, 2007; Bernanke Name, 1997;
Hamilton, 2009; Doroodian and Boyd, 2003).  As summarized in Aydin
and Acar (2011), the general consensus is that oil price shocks will
have an inverse relationship with economic activity, and higher prices
will lower GDP in oil importing regions.  However, as noted above,
lower prices may adversely impact oil exporting nations. 
CGE models have gained momentum in the past few decades in
analysing energy phenomenon (Beckman Name, 2011).  Researchers
can focus on variables of interest and follow how the rest of the economy (multiple economic sectors) adjusts in response to speciﬁc shocks.  A
popular adjustment in energy related models targets speciﬁc commodity prices.  For instance, Solaymani Name (2015) adapt the CGE model
from Solaymani and Kari (2013) to analyse the economic and environmental consequences of energy subsidy adjustments on the Malaysian
transport sector.  They investigate impacts from 3 scenarios: high oil
prices, energy subsidy reforms, and a combination of both.  Their ﬁndings show that higher oil prices raise real GDP and household income,
stimulate investment, and increase Malaysian terms of trade in the
long run. 
Aydin and Acar (2011) examined the general equilibrium impacts of
a change in oil prices, focusing on GDP, the CPI, tax revenues, trade
ﬂows, and carbon emissions in Turkey.  The model they used was called
TurGEM-D, which is a multi-sectorial dynamic model suited for the
Turkish economy, a small open net oil importing country.  Their oil
price scenarios include low, reference, and high oil prices.  Their results
show that high oil prices led to reductions in output and consumption,
however they also found that the higher prices reduced carbon
emissions.  Canada, a net exporter of oil, would likely gain from higher
oil prices, as the value of production rises with prices. 
Maisonnave Name (2012) used the GEM-E3 model to determine
whether climate policy would lessen the impact of higher energy prices
in the EU.  They found that a rise in oil prices would cost the EU 2. 2% of
GDP in the absence of climate change policy, and 1. 5% in the presence
of climate change policy. 
In the current application, we use a multi-sector dynamic CGE model
for the province of NL.  We examine the impact of a decrease in oil prices,
similar to many studies in the past that examined the impact of higher
prices.  In the current application, we model oil price reductions as a
reduction in royalties (the land royalty payments in the oil and gas
sector).  We follow this route since land inputs are exogenous in the
model, and shocking royalties will allow us to capture the reduction in
the productive capacity (and the value of production) of the oil and
gas sector due to lower prices.  Further, since royalties are exogenous,
we can capture growth in prices over time via growth in royalties; we
include a variety of scenarios for price growth, allowing us to capture
intertemporal impacts. 
<Middle> Methods. 
2. 1.  CGE model speciﬁcation. 
We use a provincial, recursive dynamic CGE model for the economy
of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL).  The model is based on neoclassical
economic theory.  The speciﬁcation for our model follows that of
Ochuodho and Lantz (2014) and Corbett Name (2015).  However, our
calibration differs as we use 2009 baseline economic data for NL
and focus on shocks to the oil and gas sector.  For more details on the
model, including equations, refer to Ochuodho and Lantz (2014). 
NL is assumed to be a small open economy that operates under perfect competition.  Producers are assumed to maximize proﬁts (deﬁned
as the difference between revenue earned and the cost of factors and intermediate inputs) subject to constant returns to scale on production
technology.  There are three primary factors of production in the
model: labour, capital, and land in the oil and gas sector (i. e.  royalties). 
The production function for ﬁrms is speciﬁed in a two-level nest.  At the
top level, a composite of value-added and a composite of intermediate
inputs are smoothly substitutable in a constant elasticity of substitution
function (CES).  At the bottom level, the three primary factors of production are assumed to substitute smoothly through a CES composite
value-added function under single primary factor nest (Rutherford
and Paltsev, 2000; Winchester Name, 2006).  Intermediate inputs, on
the other hand, are determined by ﬁxed-shares through a Leontief
function. 
There is a representative household who aims to maximize utility
through consumption.  The household receives income by supplying factors of production and from import tariff revenues transferred to them
by their domestic governments (Prasada Name, 2010).  Supplies of factors
of production are typically assumed to be ﬁxed within a given time period.  Labour and capital are mobile across sectors, whereas royalties are
speciﬁc to the oil and gas sector.  Under the capital mobility assumption,
ﬁrms could move their capital from one industry to another in response
to different rental rates in the economy (Alavalapati Name, 1998). 
Household savings rate is determined by a ﬁxed marginal propensity
to save; a ﬁxed proportion of total income is saved.  Disposable income is
total household income less savings, which is spent on consumption. 
The optimal allocation between consumption of commodities by households is through maximization of a Stone-Geary utility function or a
Linear Expenditure System (LES).  LES is structured so that expenditure
has a linear relationship with income and price, and is thus maximized
subject to the household's disposable income constraint. 
Total savings is the sum of household and foreign savings.  Investment
demand is determined by total savings factored by Cobb-Douglas investment preference for each commodity.  Unemployment is endogenous to the model, speciﬁed with a Phillips curve.  This explains
the relationship between wage and unemployment using a Laspeyres
consumer price index (CPI) and factor prices and supplies. 
Input factor supplies are exogenously determined in the model,
based on existing data.  Equilibrium in the factor markets requires that
the demand for factors equal the supply.  To achieve equilibrium, factor
prices in these markets must adjust to ensure that demand equals
supply.  However, unemployment (voluntary and involuntary) exists
due to imperfect labour markets.  Therefore, market clearing for labour
is relaxed to allow for unemployment in labour supply. 
NL, as a small open economy, differentiates traded products according to their region of origin.  That is, all goods in the model are either produced domestically or imported.  Domestic consumers discriminate
between domestically produced and imported goods through a CES
Armington speciﬁcation (Armington, 1969).  The ﬁnal ratio of imports
to domestic goods is determined by the relative prices of each type of
good as domestic demanders seek to minimize their costs.  Thus, an
increase in the domestic-import price ratio causes an increase in the
import-domestic demand ratio.  In other words, demand shifts away
from the more expensive source.  On the supply (export) side, the domestic outputs delivered to domestic market are differentiated from
products produced for export by the same sector.  So, substitution possibilities also exist between production for domestic and foreign markets. 
Producers make this decision through a constant elasticity of transformation (CET) function, which distinguishes between exported and domestic goods.  As proﬁt maximizers, producers sell in those markets
where they can achieve the highest returns.  This condition ensures
that an increase in the export-domestic price ratio causes an increase
in the export-domestic demand ratio.  Thus, demand shifts to the higher
return source. 
2. 2.  Model calibration. 
The model was calibrated to the NL economy using 2009 symmetric
IO tables produced by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2011a, 2012). 
The provincial economy was aggregated in to 21 sectors at small
(S-level) aggregation following the Northern American Industry
Classiﬁcation System (NAICS 2007 version). 
Three primary factors of production were speciﬁed, including labour,
capital, and land (royalties in the oil and gas sector).  Labour was measured using Statistics Canada IO tables, (Statistics Canada, 2012) as
wages, salaries, and supplementary labour income, in addition to
‘mixed income’ (i. e.  income of unincorporated businesses).  Capital
was also measured using Statistics Canada IO tables (Statistics Canada,
2012) as the sum of other operating surplus, indirect taxes on products,
subsidies on products, other subsidies on production, and other indirect
taxes on production less land services expenditures (in the oil and gas
sector only). 
Royalties are the payments that ﬁrms make to government for the
use and development rights of land used in oil extraction and production.  Thus, royalties are speciﬁc to the oil and gas extraction sector of
the NL economy.  Royalties are reﬂective of the value of productive
land inputs in the oil and gas industry; larger royalties indicate larger
payments on land inputs, implying enhanced productive capacity. 
Royalty values were taken from NL Provincial accounts, using an average between 2004 and 2014 (Government of NL, 2016).  Note that
while the model estimates shocks of the magnitude observed in 2014,
the model is actually calibrated in the base case using 2009 data (most
recent available at time of model development), and the analysis is conducted over the 2009–2040 period.  However, royalties in NL in 2009
were very similar to the average annual royalty over the 2004–2014
period, as well as royalties in 2014.  Thus, we believe that the model
will capture royalties (and shocks) in a reasonable way for our purposes. 
Royalties were added in the oil and gas sector, and the amount was
taken out of capital in that sector. 
Parameters were estimated to accurately reﬂect the economy of NL
in the base year.  Elasticity parameters, including income elasticity, elasticity of substitution, and elasticity of transformation, were derived from
other studies (Dimaranan, 2006).  The model is ﬁrst solved statically
given the input-output data.  The initial equilibrium represents the
benchmark state of the NL economy in 2009.  Following this static
general equilibrium, the model is solved recursively over a 31-year
(2009–2040) time period.  For every period, capital stock was updated
via a capital accumulation equation based on an endogenous growth
rate as determined by endogenous return on capital rate and endogenous total saving (Ochuodho and Lantz, 2014).  Labour was assumed
to grow at an exogenous rate in the model.  Labour supply growth
projections were estimated using projected employment data from
Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2011b).  Unless stated otherwise,
all the values are in real terms, with 2009 as the base year, and the
discount factor used for all present value calculations is 4%. 
Growth of royalties is assumed to be exogenous and to follow the
same growth path as oil prices, based on United States Energy Information Administration (US EIA) projections.  We calculate the growth rate
based on the reference oil price scenario in US EIA (2013); this growth
rate represents a change in prices between the shock period and 2040. 
For the baseline scenario, we calculate the growth rate in prices based
on the pre-shock oil price ($93 per barrel) and the price of $265 per
barrel in 2040 (US EIA, 2013).  We assume that royalty growth follows
the same growth as oil prices.  We use the 2013 publication from EIA,
as this oil price forecast was produced prior to the shock.  Our baseline
model assumes no price shocks, so price forecasts should not include
information after the shock.  Note that assuming royalties follow the
same growth path as oil prices is a simpliﬁcation, as the value of the
royalty payments are dependent on a structure of production targets,
and different net tier payments based on net proﬁt structures and
return allowance (Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, 2015b). 
2. 3.  Model solution and oil price shock scenarios. 
The model equations were solved using the General Algebraic
Modeling System (GAMS) software with a nonlinear programming
algorithm along with CONOPT3 solver (GAMS, 2012).  The model is
ﬁrst solved for the initial period to replicate the 2009 benchmark IO
tables.  Then, a dynamic baseline growth path for the economy was simulated in the model by allowing labour, capital, and royalties to grow as
described above.  Economic variables in the baseline scenario can then
be compared to those under other scenarios (or growth paths) related
to adverse shocks to royalties.  This allows for assessment of the
economic costs and impacts of reduced oil prices. 
To model the impact of oil price shocks on the provincial economy,
we used six scenarios that capture the decrease in oil prices by reducing
the value of royalties.  Again, we model a shock as reduced royalties and
not prices directly, as royalties are exogenous in the model, and we are
able to simulate growth in royalties over time.  In this way, we directly
impact the value of production in the oil and gas sector by reducing
the land input, which will impact the economy directly, as well as indirectly through related sectors.  Following all royalty shocks other than
the sixth scenario, we adjust the royalty growth rate, so that royalties
(i. e.  oil prices) will return to their predicted 2040 value as given in the
2015 (US EIA) Annual Energy Outlook (US EIA 2015).  Unlike the baseline, which relied on a 2013 (pre-shock) EIA price forecast, we use the
most recent oil price forecasts to model the growth of royalties following the shock.  Following the shock, royalties will grow at a faster rate in
order to achieve the 2040 levels.  However, long run impacts may still result, due to the initial shock.  An example of how we calculate oil price
growth, and thus royalty growth rates is provided in Table 1. 
We consider a variety of scenarios, to understand the impact of the
oil price drop, given a variety of shocks and recovery options.  Scenario
1 assumes a 50% reduction in royalties in the ﬁrst period.  Scenario 1
serves as our ‘best guess’ shock scenario, and is based on the observed
reduction in (average annual) oil prices from 2014 to 2015; average
WTI prices per barrel were $93. 26 in 2014 and $48. 69 in 2015.  The
value of royalties falls proportionally with prices, assuming that production remains constant during the one-period shock.  Following the one
period shock, royalties begin to grow at a rate of 6. 22% (see Table 1). 
We also provide sensitivity analysis for Scenario 1, to determine the
impact of varying the discount rate.  Scenarios 2–6 are included for
sensitivity and robustness.  Scenario 2 assumes a one-time, 75% decrease
in royalties in the ﬁrst period.  This implies a larger impact to the value of
production from the same magnitude oil price shock as Scenario 1, due
to potential reductions in the quantity of oil produced.  While the choice
of 75% is arbitrary, it provides sensitivity to our Scenario 1.  A worst case
scenario is represented by Scenario 3.  We decrease royalties by 90% in
the ﬁrst period, describing a scenario in which the oil and gas sector
experiences a near total productive shutdown.  Scenarios 1 through 3
involve single period declines in royalties.  Scenarios 4 and 5 differ as
they incorporate two-period royalty shocks.  This is necessary, as at the
time of this writing, we were into the second year (2016) without any
recovery in oil prices.  In the ﬁrst period, there is 50% decrease in royalties and in the subsequent second period, we impose a further 20%
reduction.  In Scenario 4, we assume that price levels recover gradually
following the shocks.  That is, they grow at a constant rate back to the
2040 levels, as in the other scenarios.  Scenario 5 allows for prices to recover immediately after the second period shock.  That is, for Scenario 5,
the NL economy recovers to price levels equal to those directly before
the shock, and then grows to the 2040 levels (at a slower pace).  The
royalty growth rates in each of the baseline and shock scenarios are provided in Table 2.  Finally, Scenario 6 considers a much more pessimistic
case, where oil prices remain low for a prolonged time.  We assume
that oil prices remain at 50% of 2014 levels for ten years.  The growth
rate of royalties following this shock is the same as Scenario 1.  This results in lower prices by 2040 than the prices assumed by EIA.  Although
the authors do not believe that this is the case that will prevail, it is provided for a sensitivity test, to understand the potential long run impacts
of a prolonged oil price shock. 
Note that we capture the general equilibrium impact of lower oil
prices by capturing the reduction in the value of production in the oil
and gas sector.  Results are measured primarily in terms of reduced
GDP, welfare (compensating variation), production, income, consumption, etc.  However, we do not capture the impact of higher unemployment (since there has not been a large rise in unemployment in NL
from 2014 to 2016), or reduced Government Revenue (royalties).  That
is, in this application, royalties are the value of inputs into production
in the oil and gas sector, and not revenue for government.  We leave
these other elements for future study. 
3.  Results. 
3. 1.  Impacts of oil price shock in the long run. 
In Table 3, we summarize these long run impacts by presenting
cumulative present value estimates for Scenario 1 and the Baseline. 
Economic costs (i. e.  reductions in compensating variation) and impacts
(i. e.  changes in GDP, income, consumption, investment, export, import,
and input expenditures) due to oil price shocks were estimated by
calculating the difference between the respective variables under the
baseline vs.  shock scenarios.  All values were presented in 2009 Canadian
dollars, over the 2009–2040 period, using a 4% discount rate.  As a result of
Scenario 1, NL GDP was estimated to fall by $7. 12 billion in present value
terms over the 30-year period, or roughly 1. 74%.  This impact occurred
because of the initial shock, and due to the fact that prices do not recover
completely (to levels forecasted prior to the shock) in 2040 following the
shock.  Economic impacts were driven in the model in all scenarios by a reduction in production (and thus income) in the oil and gas sector when
royalties fall, which ultimately impacts consumption, trade and investment in the oil and gas sector, and all related sectors indirectly.  Thus,
GDP is reduced due to lower consumption, investment and trade in all
sectors, which is based initially on lower income and production in the
oil and gas sector.  Scenario 1 caused a decline in the 30-year cumulative
values of production (0. 74%), household income (1. 77%), consumption
(1. 30%), investments (1. 59%), and labour expenditures (1. 90%).  Welfare
impacts (as measured by compensating variation) were a reduction
from 1. 1% of GDP to 0. 15% of GDP. 
In Table 4, we provide sensitivity analysis to Scenario 1, to account
for the impact of varying the discount rate.  We present cumulative
present value estimates for the difference between Scenario 1 and the
Baseline, assuming both a 2% and 6% discount rate.  The discount rate
clearly has an impact on the value of all variables in present value
terms.  However, this sensitivity analysis reveals that varying the
discount rate produces marginally different impacts for Scenario 1, in
terms of both levels and percentage values. 
We ﬁrst examine the impact of the drop in royalties on economic
variables in the long run, focusing on the Baseline model vs.  Scenario
1.  The Baseline scenario and Scenario 1 growth paths for GDP are presented in Fig.  1.  Over the 2009–2040 period, GDP was lower due to
the negative shock to royalties.  In the Baseline scenario, the economy
accumulated approximately $409. 89 billion (present value) of GDP
over the time horizon.  The effect of the 50% royalty decrease in the
ﬁrst period was stronger in the short-run, as the economy converged
back to the baseline in later years due to the fact that prices are thought
to largely recover by 2040.  This is captured in the model by the fact that
our royalty growth rates are higher following a shock. 
3. 2.  Oil price shock in the short run. 
We focus the majority of the remaining analysis on short run impacts.  Short-run analysis provides insights into how the NL economy
adjusts immediately following a shock, or when the impacts are the
largest.  This is deemed to be more interesting in this analysis, since by
design, the prices will largely recover in the long run, based on pre
and post-shock oil price forecasts by EIA.  Since we capture this through
royalty growth rates, the impacts in the long run are likely to be lower
than short run impacts. 
In the ﬁrst year following the Scenario 1 shock, $464 million in GDP
was lost in comparison to the Baseline scenario.  The impact in the
second year was lower, as we observed a drop in GDP of $444 million
relative to baseline.  Table 5 presents the ﬁve-year cumulative impacts
of Scenario 1 relative to the baseline for key economic indicators of
interest.  The difference in 5-year cumulative GDP was $2. 13 billion. 
The percentage change for 5-year cumulative GDP (2. 1%) was larger
than that for the 30-year horizon, which indicates that the difference
between Baseline and Scenario 1 was larger in early years, and became
smaller as time passed after the initial shock.  All other key variables fell
in similar magnitude to GDP in the ﬁrst ﬁve years. 
3. 3.  Sensitivity: shock magnitude. 
In Scenarios 2 and 3, we explore short run impacts, assuming the
shocks are larger than expected.  Scenario 2 is meant to capture a scenario where production (quantity, not just value) is also signiﬁcantly
impacted, and Scenario 3 considers a worst case where production
almost ceases to exist for one year.  These scenarios are for the purposes
of sensitivity analysis and to illustrate what might occur in the future, as
such circumstances have not come to pass in NL.  As expected, the shortrun impacts of Scenarios 2 and 3 are greater than that of Scenario 1.  That
is, the larger the shock to royalties, the larger the impact on GDP and
other economic indicators.  Table 6 presents ﬁve-year cumulative impacts for Scenarios 2 and 3.  For Scenario 2, we see that a 75% decline
in royalties caused GDP to fall by $20. 52 billion from the Baseline
scenario.  Scenario 3 had an even larger impact on GDP, causing a
$26. 08 billion loss over ﬁve years.  Household income, consumption,
labour expenditure, and royalties show consistent results; the larger the
magnitude of the shock, the larger the adverse effect on each variable. 
It is interesting to note that the general equilibrium impacts for NL
estimated in our Scenario 1 are comparable to preliminary estimates
of a 2% drop in real GDP since 2014 (Government of Newfoundland
and Labrador, 2015a, 2015b).  The impacts in Scenarios 2 and 3 illustrate
potential worst-case scenarios, but are not consistent with what has
been observed in NL.  They are therefore not realistic scenarios, but provided for sensitivity analysis only.  Our Scenario 1 does seem to capture
the impact reasonably well, based on observed data.  The ﬁve year
cumulative impact of 2. 1%, and one year impact of 2. 13% (not shown
above) are in line with that 2% impact.  The additional advantage to
this analysis is that we capture the impact on several other variables
of interest and also capture long run impacts.  Further, and given conﬁdence about initial results, we consider the impacts of a prolonged
shock in year 2 and beyond, given different patterns of re-growth. 
3. 4.  Sensitivity: shock duration. 
Scenarios 4 and 5 capture shocks in the ﬁrst two years following the
price decline.  In period one, royalties fall by 50%, as in Scenario 1, but in
year two, royalties fall by an additional 20%.  These two-period shocks to
the model aim to reﬂect the current situation in the oil market.  The difference between the two scenarios is that in Scenario 4, royalties gradually
rise to 2040 levels following the shock, as in Scenario 1, whereas in Scenario 5, we assume royalties recover instantly to pre-2014 levels, and
then grow at a slower rate (than Scenario 4).  Impacts are the same in
years 1 and 2 for Scenarios 4 and 5: in the ﬁrst year, GDP fell by $495 million from the baseline.  The loss in the second period was $754 million.  Impacts began to differ in the third period.  As expected, the short-run (ﬁve
year) impacts for Scenario 4 were greater because prices are not allowed
to recover immediately following the shock.  However, in both cases of
persistent shocks, cumulative ﬁve-year impacts were greater than that
of a single-period 50% decline in royalties (Scenario 1).  Scenario 4 resulted
in a $3. 04 billion decline in GDP from the baseline scenario, whereas Scenario 5 resulted in a $2. 69 billion loss.  Table 7 presents the ﬁve-year cumulative impacts of the persistent shocks on GDP and other variables of
interest.  Household income, investment, consumption, labour expenditure, and royalties show consistent impacts: gradual price recovery resulted in larger economic impacts than immediate price recovery, but both
scenarios led to higher losses than Scenario 1. 
Finally, Table 8 summarizes results associated with Scenario 6, in
which we assume oil prices remain at 50% of 2014 levels for a ten-year period.  Given that this is a longer duration of assumed oil price shocks, we
present long run results for this scenario, focusing on ten-year and
thirty-year impacts of the persistent shock.  Unlike the cases above,
where prices were assumed to return to EIA 2040 values, we would expect more signiﬁcant long run impacts in this scenario.  Cumulative present values of all variables are presented relative to the Baseline scenario. 
In this case, we estimated signiﬁcant impacts in both the ten-year horizon
and the longer run, due to the prolonged shocks.  Unlike Scenario 1, the
impacts were higher in percentage terms over the long-run horizon
than they were over the ﬁve or ten-year horizon.  The impacts are relative
to the Baseline scenario; since the growth of oil prices was observed for an
extra 10 years in the Baseline scenario, much higher values were observed
in the long run when compared to our Scenario 6.  Overall, GDP was estimated to fall by 2. 89% over ten-years, and by 3. 57% in the long-run.  Other
variables fell by similar proportions, with the exception of royalties, which
fell by over 50% relative to Baseline values.  This value is so high due to the
50% shock implemented for ten years, but also since growth of royalties
did not occur during this period, whereas it did in our Baseline scenario. 
When comparing results to Scenarios 4 and 5, we see that the overall impact was much higher, since it is over a longer period, but the results in
percentage terms were quite similar.  When comparing the long run
impacts of these persistent shocks to the long run impact of a one-year
shock of the same magnitude (Table 3), we see dramatic differences. 
GDP was predicted to fall by 3.
