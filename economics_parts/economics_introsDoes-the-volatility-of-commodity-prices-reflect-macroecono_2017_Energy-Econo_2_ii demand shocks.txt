The literature on oil and commodity markets during the last
decade has shown the importance to identify and understand the
causes and consequences of commodity price shocks.  Some of the
key insights (Kilian, 2008a) are that (i) most commodity prices
are endogenous with respect to the global business cycle, and (ii)
demand shocks cause delayed and sustained price movements while
supply shocks have small and transitory effects.  Whereas disentangling the supply and demand components in a structural model is
now common in the empirical literature to understand commodity price dynamics (especially for crude oil price), some important
concerns are missing regarding the effect of second-order moments
(especially the one related to uncertainty).
