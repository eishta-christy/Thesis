 1.  Introduction Most liberalized electricity markets suffer from market power, with high concentration indices, and are frequently subject to market investigations (see for example DG COMP, 2007).  Academics and consultants alike struggle to model the exercise of this market power and the implications of possible reforms, such as increasing interconnection (Newbery et al. , 2004), moving to nodal pricing (Joskow and Tirole, 2000), market coupling (Newbery et al. , 2016), breaking up larger companies such as EdF in France (INSEAD, 2004), introducing capacity auctions (Entriken and Wan, 2003.  Genoese et al. , 2012.  Hach et al. , 2015.  Hu and Hobbs, 2008) or by increasing the volumes of renewables (Liski and Vehviläinen, 2015.  Newbery, 2016).  The main problem facing those wishing quantiﬁed results rather than illustrative examples lies in the considerable diﬃculty of modeling strategic behaviour in markets with various capacity and transmission constraints, in which the participants interact daily on auction markets under conditions of great transparency.  Electricity is possibly the best example of the textbook example of a perfectly homogenous product that would seem to favour intense price competition, but, as observed above, liberalized electricity markets are characterized by oligopoly and deviations from competitive behaviour.  Moreover, generators have very complete information about their own and rivals’ short-run cost functions, which are determined by known technologies and observable fuel prices.  Cournot models may be suitable for modeling potential market power and prices for speciﬁc levels of demand (Moselle et al. , 2006) but electricity demand varies substantially hourly, daily and seasonally.  In practice, and more extensively now that the EU has almost completed market coupling at the day-ahead stage, generating companies offer their supply as a function of offer prices (often a step function, see Newbery et al. , 2013) into EUPHEMIA,2 the auction platform that determines day-ahead prices for the whole of the market-coupled EU.  The natural way of modeling the outcomes of that auction are to look for Supply Function Equilibria, but these are notoriously hard to solve or even simulate (Day et al. , 2002).  Nevertheless, the central idea of a supply function is helpful, in that it requires agents to form a view of the supplies offered by other generators, which, when subtracted from total demand, gives a perceived residual demand.  Each agent can then choose an optimal supply response.  If all agents have well-deﬁned supply behaviour it is in principle possible to ﬁnd a Nash equilibrium in which each oligopolist maximizes its proﬁts given the behaviour of other market participants.  The agents may choose to offer ﬁxed quantities – Cournot behaviour – or may choose to mark-up their offers on their variable costs, and the relevant demand facing those with market power may have competitive supplies subtracted from total demand.  The central point of this paper is that while the residual demand facing an agent depends on the choices of other agents, the assumption that the market will settle at the Nash equilibrium of these speciﬁc choices needs to be tested for robustness.  The equilibrium will not be robust if it is proﬁtable for an agent, knowing the strategies of all other players, to choose a different strategy.  This paper tests the robustness of various popular modeling approaches for an electricity market with a small number of players.  We study two particular forms of mark-up pricing.  ﬁxed and proportional, where in the former, ﬁrms set a ﬁxed mark-up on their marginal cost schedule and in the latter, ﬁrms choose a proportional mark-up.  We analyze these two mark-up pricing models because most studies (some of which are reviewed below) ﬁnd that where electricity markets are concentrated, generators are selling at prices above the competitive short-run marginal cost.  They have the attraction that the choice of a single parameter (the mark-up) considerably simpliﬁes the modeling problem (Weidlich and Veit, 2008).  More important, they are consistent with the forms of offers that are allowed in most power exchanges and by EUPHEMIA.  We compare the results with the standard Nash-Cournot model in which agents just choose the quantity to supply to the market.  In auction markets like power pools and EUPHEMIA this would require producers to offer a ﬁxed amount at some minimum price (e. g.  variable cost) and then receive the price set by the interaction of total supply andWe note that for the case of linear marginal costs and linear demand, the supply function equilibrium is a proportional mark-up model (Klemperer and Meyer, 1986), but we are interested in a wider set of cost and demand functions.  One of the main conclusions of this paper is that the proportional mark-up model would seem to have wider appeal in modeling market power than just in the linear case, and in that sense it forms a useful simpliﬁcation of complex supply function models that lends itself to modeling market power.  We examine the robustness of both forms of mark-up pricing and ask whether these models are robust against more sophisticated (Stackelberg) strategies.  If so, they pass the ﬁrst test of plausibility, but if not, then modelers need to be aware of their fragility and consider alternatives, which we discuss.  Throughout we assume a market structure similar to electricity pools (e. g.  Green and Newbery, 1992) or the EUPHEMIA European platform, which is a last-price auction in which offers from generators and bids from suppliers are submitted and the market clearing price is determined (subject to various constraints, such as transmission capacities).  We assume that the daily interaction on the auction market or power exchange, combined with cost transparency, makes it plausible that agents know or learn the supply behaviour of their rivals.  They are also assumed to know how the market clearing price is set, bearing in mind that different plants have different costs (different eﬃciencies, different fuels) and demand varies hourly, by day of the week, and seasonally.  We show that the two mark-up strategies considered are more competitive than Nash-Cournot behaviour, with the Nash choice of the optimal proportional mark-up on marginal costs yielding lower prices and proﬁts than the Cournot oligopoly but higher prices and proﬁts than the optimum ﬁxed mark-up on marginal costs.  In deterministic cases, the mark-up equilibria are robust against Nash deviations by single ﬁrms choosing quantities (or any other actions) instead of mark-ups.  However, these mark-up equilibria are not robust to more sophisticated single-ﬁrm Stackelberg deviations in which the deviant maintains her output and the remaining players adapt to that and ﬁnd the corresponding mark-up equilibrium output levels.  This would be achieved by the deviant repeatedly offering the same supply into an auction market (like a pool or the EUPHEMIA platform) and the remaining players then groping towards their most proﬁtable response.  The deviant player makes higher proﬁts following this Stackelberg strategy.  If demand is stochastic, then a ﬁxed quantity response (deterministic Cournot) is strictly inferior to either mark-up equilibria.  In the case of linear marginal costs and linear demand, the proportional mark-up equilibrium as a supply function equilibrium is robust against any deviation, while a ﬁxed mark-up is vulnerable to a proportional mark-up deviant.  This paper makes a number of contributions to the literature on electricity market modeling and oligopoly pricing.  It ﬁrst sets the scene by ranking in order of proﬁtability three common market equilibrium models.  the standard Cournot model (in which producers offer a ﬁxed quantity into the auction platform and the price is set by the demand side),3 and two price-setting models in which ﬁrms set prices as mark-ups on their marginal costs.  This allows us to test their robustness against various kinds of deviations by single and multiple ﬁrms, ﬁrst on the assumption of certainty, and then under uncertainty about demand levels.  If, as in most industrial commodity industries and particularly for electricity, marginal costs are increasing, we ﬁnd that proportional mark-ups emerge as the more attractive pricing model, which we relate to the literature on supply functions usually connected to electricity markets.  These ﬁndings are relevant to the considerable literature on simulation modeling of such industries, widely used in investment analysis, policy reform (e. g.  Green and Newbery, 1992, commenting on restructuring state-owned monopoly generation companies) and anti-trust investigations.  The paper is organized as follows.  In Section 2, we brieﬂy survey different modeling approaches to oligopolistic electricity markets.  In Section 3, we introduce our mark-up models and test their robustness to Cournot deviations.  Section 4 tests our models against Stackelberg deviations.  Section 5 concludes.  <Middle> Modeling oligopolistic electricity markets.  Electricity markets have the great advantage for the study of market power in that high resolution price data (hourly or halfhourly) are available, together with aggregate demand and supply in that period (and sometimes individual company’s supply, e. g.  Sweeting, 2007).  Variable costs are also easy to simulate, and in some markets are observable for each generation company (e. g.  in the Single Electricity Market of the island of Ireland).  One standard test of market power is benchmark analysis using estimates of the short-run marginal cost of production (given by fuel prices and conversion eﬃciencies and aggregating across all marginal costs) to 2 1 Pan-European Hybrid Electricity Market Integration Algorithm.  see https. // www. apxgroup. com/wp-_content/uploads/Euphemia-_Public-_Documentation. pdf.  simulate a hypothetical competitive market.  Wolfram (1999) used this approach and actual cost data to measure the price-cost markup for the duopoly price setters in the electricity market of England and Wales, ﬁnding that they moderated their mark-ups in the light of intense regulatory and competition authority scrutiny.  The same approach of measuring mark-ups has been applied by Wolak et al.  (2000), Borenstein et al.  (2002), Joskow and Kahn (2002), van Damme (2005), and Bushnell et al.  (2008).  In contrast to Wolfram, Borenstein et al.  (2002) found high price-cost margins in the high demand summer months in California.  The other standard approach is to postulate a model of market power and compare its predictions with market outcomes.  Borenstein and Bushnell (1999) use historical data to simulate the California electricity market as a static Cournot market with a competitive fringe, while Puller (2007) uses data to conclude that the market is relatively consistent with a Cournot pricing game.  A number of other authors use this standard I–O workhorse of Cournot competition to examine electricity market power, but in two-stage games, following the lead of Kreps and Scheinkman (1983).  The ﬁrst stage is to choose capacity (and a number of electricity markets have periodic capacity auctions), while the second stage is to choose supplies to offer into the spot market, constrained by prior capacity choices.  Kreps and Scheinkman (1983) show that even if the second stage is an intensely competitive price-setting (Bertrand) game, introducing the prior capacity choice can support Cournot outcomes.  Much depends on the contestability of the ﬁrst stage capacity choice.  Teirila (forthcoming) examines the proposed Irish capacity market in which there is potentially excess capacity and hence unlikely to be signiﬁcant entry, limiting the ﬁrst stage to competition between incumbents, who must decide their capacity auction bids after estimating their revenues in the subsequent Cournot spot market.  Teirila ﬁnds considerable potential market power in the proposed capacity auction, implying that ways to mitigate that market power may be necessary.  Léautier (2016) studies a capacity market (and reliability options) in which the system operator speciﬁes the total capacity that must be built at the ﬁrst stage, leaving the spot market to imperfect Cournot competition.  This removes the incentive for generators to choose to undersupply capacity as in Kreps and Scheinkman (1983) .  Cournot models are attractive as they are simple to solve, but can result in unrealistically high mark-ups unless either capacities or contracts are chosen in a prior stage.  Allaz and Vila (1993) is the classic reference to the pro-competitive effect of forward contracting, and Bushnell et al.  (2008) examine the effect of contracting on the incentive to exercise market power in a Cournot model and show that vertical contracts dramatically reduce these incentives.  It is therefore possible to reconcile observed behaviour with Cournot quantity setting generators, but only by solving the prior issue of the level of contracting.  Similarly Mulder et al.  (2015) model large players contracting ahead and playing Cournot in the spot market facing competitive supply from importers and a fringe of intermittent wind generators and CHP plants, to examine the effects of each on the Lerner mark-up.  Floro (2009) examines the Italian market in which ENEL is a dominant player, more so in the South than the North.  In the North, oligopoly can either be modeled as a Cournot game, or one in which ENEL acts as a Stackelberg leader against the remaining ﬁrms, and the latter ﬁts the evidence better.  In the South, the other players act as price takers, and ENEL acts as the dominant ﬁrm optimizing against residual demand.  All these examples simulating or estimating spot market power are essentially static Cournot models with different boundary conditions that determine the size and shape of the residual market (resulting from other competitive suppliers or pre-committed contracts).  A rather different strand of modeling assumes that the large generators with market power choose mark-ups on cost.  Grant and Quiggin (1994) analytically model ﬁrms choosing their proﬁt-maximizing mark-up over average cost instead of choosing the optimal output level, although in their constant elasticity model this is equivalent to choosing a mark-up on variable cost.  Another related strand is to model each generator as choosing its mark-up on variable cost, but instead of solving this analytically, each generator follows a learning strategy to converge on a proﬁt-maximizing mark-up, given its interaction with other players.  Tirole’s classic text on Industrial Organization notes the diﬃculty in theorizing about ﬁrms with market power that repeatedly interact in markets, and notes (Tirole, 2000, p.  240, 261) that “the proliferation of theories is mirrored by an equally rich array of behavioural patterns actually observed under oligopoly. ” After discussing the delicacy of game theoretic models with reputation, he turns to the Darwinian or evolutionary approach, in which agents may not consciously maximize but suboptimal rules will be rejected or lead to exit.  “This approach .  .  .  looks at strategies, or (better terminology) rules, that are ‘robust’ in the sense that they do relatively well against a variety of other rules.  .  .  .  The evolutionary approach assumes that, in the long run, only actors who use robust rules will stay around.  .  .  .  What is mean by ‘robust rule’ is a priori contingent on the set and the probability distribution of mutations, and on the set of strategies the robust rule is allowed to be compared to. ” 3.  The market model.  Different mark-up formulations lead to different equilibria that can be ranked in terms of proﬁt, motivating the reason why a sophisticated agent may wish to choose a different strategy from her rivals.  The two mark-up models are examined for their robustness against the ﬁrst type of Nash-Cournot deviation, demonstrating their robustness against single-ﬁrm deviations but not to multi-ﬁrm deviations.  Consider a market of n identical ﬁrms, i = 1, .  .  .  , n, producing a non-storable homogenous output, qi, (e. g.  electricity) selling at price p, each with cost functionC(q i), marginal cost, MC, C(cid. 2)(qi) > 0, C≥ 0, facing an aggregate demand schedule Q(p), Q(cid. 2)(p) < 0, Q (p) ≥ 0,qi.  The residual demand schedule facing any single ﬁrm i, Ri(Q−i(. )), Q−i = j(cid. 4)=iqj, will depend on the supplies offered by the n − 1 other ﬁrms at the market clearing price.  Working with price as the dependent variable, ﬁrm i(cid. 2)s residual demand will be Ri(p) = Q(p) − (n − 1)¯q(p), where ¯q(p) is the equilibrium supply offered by each of the n − 1 remaining ﬁrms.  Firm i(cid. 2)s proﬁt will be pi(p) = pRi(p) − C(Ri(p)), and the ﬁrst order condition (f. o. c. ) for proﬁt maximization.  This gives the Lerner Index, one of the standard measures of market power, asThe benchmark perfectly competitive (Walrasian) equilibrium has p(n¯q) = C(cid. 2)(¯q), in which case the Lerner Index is zero.  3. 1.  The robustness of mark-up equilibria.  In a symmetric n-ﬁrm oligopoly the possible Nash Equilibria (NE) will depend on the strategy set, and whether each ﬁrm chooses its strategic variable simultaneously.  The three cases considered are the Nash-Cournot equilibrium, in which ﬁrms choose quantities, the ﬁxed mark-up equilibrium in which ﬁrms add a ﬁxed mark-up mi to MC.  C(cid. 2)(qi) + mi, and the proportional mark-up to marginal cost, in which ﬁrms offer supplies in proportion to MC, hC(cid. 2)(qi), h > 1.  Further, deﬁne Q i(m) = ˜qi(mi, P(m)) and pi(m) = P(m)Q i(m) − C(Q i(m)).  Then the ﬁxed mark-up model solution is a symmetric vector of mark-ups m∗ such that for ﬁrm i.  The proportional mark-up model is similar except that ﬁrm i(cid. 2)s quantity for a symmetric price p is determined by p = hiC (qi).  The Appendix derives the mark-ups for the linear demand, quadratic costProposition 1 ranks the three equilibria (Nash-Cournot, ﬁxed mark-up and proportional mark-up) for the cases in which ﬁrms make simultaneous decisions.  As h > 1 , the RHS of Eq.  (3) is larger than Eq.  (2) but smaller than Eq.  (1) , each evaluated at ¯qp , so reasoning as in (ii), the proportional price-MC margin will be in between the mark-up margin and the NashCournot margin, demonstrating that the proportional MC strategy is less competitive than the ﬁxed mark-up strategy, but more competitive than the Nash-Cournot strategy, and the equilibrium prices will lie between these two equilibria.  Finally, in each case the price-MC margin is strictly positive and hence prices will be higher than the competitive equilibriumprice.  Fig.  1 illustrates the result of the deviant choosing output when the remaining ﬁrms choose to offer at a ﬁxed mark-up on marginal cost for the linear demand, quadratic cost case as set out in the Appendix.  The deviant’s optimal response is to choose qd to maximize proﬁt, pqd − C(qd), given the residual demand generated by the ﬁxed mark-up behaviour, which in this linear case can be written p = (a − qd)/b for some a and b.  The question to address is whether choosing the Nash mark-up given in Appendix Eq.  (13) is robust against a player optimizing against this strategy.  Proposition 2 shows, as the ﬁgure clearly demonstrates, that the answer is yes.  Proposition 2.  In a deterministic Nash game, if players assume that the strategy space is the choice of the ﬁxed or proportional mark-up on its marginal cost, then that player will maximize her proﬁts regardless of whether another player chooses the same strategy choice as other players (ﬁxed or proportional mark-up on marginal cost) or an optimal quantity to supply, and hence the two Nash mark-up equilibria are robust against Cournot deviations.  Proposition 1.  In the simultaneous move symmetric n-ﬁrm oligopoly, the Nash Equilibrium price is highest in the Nash-Cournot equilibrium, higher than in the proportional mark-up equilibrium, which in turn is higher than the ﬁxed mark-up equilibrium, which is higher than the competitive price.  Proof.  Each ﬁrm faces the same residual demand schedule and will choose the same optimal output whether they choose the optimal ﬁxed or proportional mark-up, or the optimal quantity (or any other choice variable such as price) that corresponds to MC set equal to the marginal residual demand revenue.  Proof.  (i) If the other firms choose quantities (Cournot), ¯q(p) = ¯qc, and firm i ’s residual demand will be Rci (p) = Q(p)−(n−1)¯qc , so Rc i = Q(p), and the f. o. c.  for profit maximization will define the equilibrium output.  (cid. 2)(cid. 2) ≥ 0 , the RHS ofEq.  (2) is less than that of Eq.  (1) evaluated at ¯qc = ¯qm .  But as demand slopes down and the MC slopes (weakly) up, the only way that the Nash mark-up could be higher would be if ¯qc < ¯qm and pc > pm .  It follows that the ﬁxed mark-up price-MC margin will be lower than under Nash-Cournot competition. will be Pj(qj) = hC(cid. 2)(qj) , p equilibrium ¯qp(p) = C(cid. 2)−1 (iii) If ﬁrms choose a proportional mark-up, then their offer schedules.  Thus the Nash equilibrium behaviour in ﬁxed or proportional mark-ups is robust against a Nash-Cournot deviant who can choose from a broader set of strategies that also includes quantities, at least in a deterministic setting.  Fig.  2 illustrates this for the case in which all but the deviant ﬁrm choose their supply as a proportional mark-up on their linear MC.  This result should not be surprising, as once the other ﬁrms have chosen their optimal ﬁxed (or proportional) mark-up given the residual demand they assume faces them, the deviant faces the same residual demand and hence chooses the same mark-up, which is where the residual marginal revenue meets MC, shown in Figs.  1 and 2.  One might reasonably argue that the resulting outcome is no longer a true Nash equilibrium, in that while the deviant ﬁrm correctly predicts what the other ﬁrms will do, the other ﬁrms are not correctly predicting what strategy the deviant is following and hence not correctly predicting the residual demand they face, although they are predicting the mark-up she will actually choose.  We will explore this further in Section 4.  It is also important to note that although the equilibrium is robust to deviations, the resulting price depends on the strategy space, in this case the ﬁxed or proportional mark-ups rather than quantities (and is lower as a result).  3. 2.  Multi-ﬁrm deviations.  Suppose that r ﬁrms decide to play a Cournot strategy, knowing that n − r ﬁrms will continue with their ﬁxed mark-up strategies but the other deviants will choose the same output as the ﬁrst deviant (but independently, each taking the other’s output as given).  For the linear-quadratic example set out in Appendix, the market clearing condition is p = A − q − (r − 1)qo − n−r nc (p − m), where m is the ﬁxed mark-up, qo is the output of each of the other Cournot deviants, taken as given, and q is the output choice to be made.  As before the f. o. c.  for the deviant is given.  Set qo = q and substitute for m to give.  As a numerical example, let n = 5, r = 2, c = 1, A = 100, so that the symmetric mark-up equilibrium has qi = 9A/95 = 9. 47, p = 52. 6.  The deviants’ output will be 98A/1045 = 9. 378, which is smaller, so the equilibrium will be different.  The price will be p = 52. 8 and so the proﬁt of a deviating ﬁrm rather than conforming to the original strategy will be 274. 8 rather than 274. 2, or 0. 22% higher.  Thus there is a (small) incentive for a subset of more than one (very) sophisticated ﬁrms to deviate from a Nash mark-up equilibrium.  This is reminiscent of Delgado and Moreno (2004), who show that only the Cournot outcome can be sustained by a coalitionproof supply function equilibrium, in conﬁgurations such as this, with linear demand and at least three players.  However, the meaning of the Cournot outcome with supply functions is rather different, as it is the least competitive supply function, which is not a constant level of output.  3. 3.  Robustness under uncertainty.  The results derived above assume no uncertainty in the level of demand nor of cost, and the results are not robust to uncertainty.  We know from Weitzman (1974) and Klemperer and Meyer (1986) that the choice of quantity or price may be a matter of indifference under perfect certainty, but not with uncertainty.  Consider the simple case of additive risk, where ˜e is a mean zero random variable (indicated with a tilde) and D(Q) is deterministic.  Proposition 3.  Under additive risk, a Cournot deviant in a simultaneous play Nash game will earn lower proﬁts than players choosing either a constant or proportional mark-up on their marginal costs.  Proof.  Under additive risk as in Eq.  (4) the optimal mark-up is the same as under uncertainty, as the partial derivatives of price and quantity with respect to the ﬁxed mark-up, mi, or proportional mark-up parameter, hi, are deterministic.  Expected proﬁt is Ep(Q , e)qi(0i, e)− C(qi(0i, e), where 0i = mi or hi.  But ∂qi/∂0i and ∂p/∂0i are both deterministic, which is the same deterministic equation for Eqi as for qi in the deterministic case.  Additivity also implies the same deterministic f. o. c.  for the deviant’s optimal choice of quantity, qd = Eqi.  The difference in proﬁt between the deviant choosing a ﬁxed quantity and her mark-up rivals is pd = pi = Eqi. Ep − Epqi < 0, as p and qi are positively correlated.  (cid. 2) Whether a proportional mark-up equilibrium is robust against a ﬁxed mark-up deviant, and a ﬁxed mark-up equilibrium is robust against a proportional mark-up deviant is less clear, except in the linear marginal cost case.  Proposition 4.  In the case of stochastic demand and linear marginal costs, the proportional mark-up equilibrium is robust against a ﬁxed mark-up deviant but the ﬁxed mark-up equilibrium is vulnerable to a proportional mark-up deviant.  Proof.  We know from Klemperer and Meyer (1989) that there is a unique linear supply function equilibrium in the case of linear marginal costs which has constant slope, so the proportional markup equilibrium is also the supply function equilibrium and hence optimal against any deviation.  4.  Robustness to Stackelberg deviations.  Although a single deviant was unable to improve on her proﬁts by choosing quantities rather than mark-ups in the deterministic case, knowing that the remaining ﬁrms were acting on the (mistaken) assumption that all ﬁrms were choosing their mark-up facing the same residual demand schedule, there remains the question whether this is a consistently formulated equilibrium for a sophisticated deviant.  In our model, a sophisticated deviant acts as a Stackelberg leader facing rivals who take the leader’s behaviour as given, and learn to adapt to offer their best response.  If all that ﬁrms observe is the consequences of their choices in the market price, then they are correctly choosing the optimal choice of mark-up (or output).  If they are basing their choice of mark-up on assumptions about the shape of the residual demand they face, then the assumed residual demand will be incorrect in the face of a Cournot deviant.  One way round this inconsistency is to suppose that the deviant ﬁrm’s strategy choice is known to the remaining ﬁrms, who nevertheless continue to choose their mark-up (and similarly the deviant knows that the other ﬁrms will behave that way).  In a learning context, this would require the leader to stick to her output strategy, while the followers learned that they could then improve their proﬁts by adapting to the new environment.  The resulting equilibrium is most simply modeled as the outcome of a Stackelberg game in which the deviant is the leader who can commit in this case to her output, and to which the followers respond.  As the aim is to demonstrate that deterministic mark-up equilibria are not robust to this more sophisticated deviation, this section considers the simpler duopoly case (n = 2) for the linear quadratic example of Appendix.  The ﬁrst step reproduces the classic Cournot Stackelberg oligopoly.  The leader can commit to her output level, ql, before the other (the follower) makes his choice, qf, so that the leader can optimize against the follower’s reaction function Eq.  (10) given in the Appendix.  The resulting equilibrium.  These expressions are somewhat opaque, but simplify in the constant returns case in which c = 0 to the familiar solution ql = A/2, qf = A/4 =p, and the proﬁt of the leader is A2/8, larger than the follower’s proﬁt, who receives only one-half as much or A2/16, and also higher than under the symmetric Nash Cournot equilibrium of A2/9.  If c = 1, then ql = 12A/56 > qo = A/5 > qf = 11A/56 and the leader’s proﬁt is 0. 45% higher than in the symmetric duopoly.  At lower values of c the leader’s advantage increases, so at c = 0. 1 the advantage is 6. 8%, and for c = 0 (the constant returns case) it is 11%.  4. 1.  Stackelberg quantity deviations from the mark-up equilibrium.  The question we now address is whether choosing the optimal Nash mark-up is robust against a more sophisticated player who in a sequential setting can stick to her optimal output while the other player continues to mark up on marginal cost but learns the optimal mark-up (effectively the correct position on his residual demand schedule).  The previous duopoly example demonstrates that markup behaviour it is not robust (in a deterministic setting at least) against a Cournot (quantity-ﬁxing) deviation and that is also the case when the follower is choosing his mark-up.  Thus if the leader commits to a quantity, ql, the follower chooses a mark-up m given the residual demand schedule qf(ql) = A − p − ql.  The follower’s supply schedule is given by Appendix Eq.  (12) with n = 2, so market clearing yields.
