In South Africa, the hake ﬁshing industry is an important contributor
to income in coastal communities, generating some 30,000 jobs
(Rademeyer Name, 2008).  It is also the country's most valuable ﬁshery
(Butterworth and Rademeyer, 2005.  Petersen Name, 2010), generating
an estimated 5 billion South African Rand (ZAR) per year at present. 
The costs, revenues and proﬁts in this industry are much the same as
those incurred by ﬁsheries internationally, such as fuel and market
price for ﬁsh (e. g.  the target species Merluccius capensis and M. 
paradoxus).  It is, however, a highly consolidated and vertically integrated industry with heterogeneous business models and a high level of
complexity (Cooper Name, 2014).  This makes the relative importance
and complex interactions and trade-offs among different drivers like
fuel price and environmental variability for the industry and its proﬁts
hard to estimate at a glance. 
It is known that economic, ecological and social dimensions must be
appropriately considered to ensure successful management for the sustainability of ﬁsheries (Folke Name, 2007.  Garcia and Charles, 2008. 
Pitcher and Lam, 2010).  Effective policies for the sustainability of
human (social and economic) and natural systems are underpinned
by untangling the complexities of these systems, such as emergent
properties and reciprocal effects (Liu Name, 2007).  To be able to meaningfully incorporate ecological and human dimensions into management through appropriate objectives with measurable outcomes or
indicators for South Africa's hake ﬁshery, it is necessary to ﬁrst have insight into the functioning of the industry and how its proﬁts are affected
by changes in some of its major drivers.  Proﬁtability is a signiﬁcant incentive for commercial ﬁshing companies (Sumaila Name, 2008). 
A modelling approach can provide insight into this type of complex
system and its structure, function and dynamics (Liu Name,2007), particularly in a situation such as South Africa's where publically available
economic data on the ﬁsheries is scarce.  Scenario testing provides further understanding of how changes in external drivers affect the
industry's structure, function or dynamics.  Achieving insight into the
South African offshore demersal hake trawl ﬁshery was the impetus behind the building of HakeSim, an agent-based model (ABM) of the ﬁshery (Cooper, 2015.  Cooper and Jarre, 2017).  HakeSim captures the
complex industry structure, complete with heterogeneous company,
vessel and market agents, as well as important factors that affect the
industry's proﬁtability such as fuel price, total allowable catch, environmental variability (through a proxy), domestic and international market
price and demand for hake. 
Fuel price is one factor that majorly affects running costs and therefore proﬁtability of the offshore hake trawl industry.  It can account as
much as 60% of running costs for ﬁshing companies (Sumaila Name,
2008).  It is well known as a core issue affecting ﬁsheries economics
and dynamics worldwide and, for example, has been identiﬁed as particularly signiﬁcant for the proﬁtability of wetﬁsh trawlers that land
fresh ﬁsh in neighbouring Namibia (BCLME, 2006.  Gasalla Name, 2010. 
Sumaila Name, 2008).  Even where it accounts a lower percentage (10
or 25%), such as in other trawl industries, it can hinder ﬁsheries in the
case of a price increase (Sumaila Name, 2008).  Arnason (2007) point
out that increased fuel prices from 2004 meant signiﬁcant increases in
cost and reductions in proﬁt, which could push companies already not
making a proﬁt into exiting the ﬁshery.  Anecdotally, the South African
industry complained of critical interactions between fuel price and
catch per unit effort (CPUE) during high fuel price periods and that it
was difﬁcult to sustain proﬁts at these times.  Previous modelling scenario analysis with HakeSim demonstrated that prices above ZAR 18. 783
per litre, prices that could occur with a large fuel price increase or removal of fuel subsidies, caused all modelled companies to make a loss
and lower fuel prices than this could cause companies to make an unacceptably low return on investment to continue operations (Cooper and
Jarre, 2017).
