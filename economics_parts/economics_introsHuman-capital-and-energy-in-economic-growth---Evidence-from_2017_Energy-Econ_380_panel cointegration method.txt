 1.  Introduction Environmental sustainability, climate change and global warming have attracted increasing public awareness (Bloch et al. , 2012.  Ma, 2015).  Many countries have set and ratiﬁed nationally determined contributions in the recent Paris agreement, targeting to keep the global average temperature increase well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels.  China, who accounts for half of the world coal consumption and contributes to 25% of the world carbon dioxide emission (Energy Information Administration, 2016), in particular, sets a goal of achieving the peak before 2030, lowering the emission per unit of GDP by 60–65% from its 2005 level, and increasing the non-fossil fuel share in the primary energy consumption to 20%.  A sweeping energy evolution is called for in China since 2014 with new priority placed on environmental goals and the deployment of clean energy. 1 However, it remains a challenge to meet the goal considering the uneven distribution of energy resources and unbalanced economic growth with a high degree of inequality (Herrerias et al. , 2013.  Song and Zheng, 2012).  For China to align the long-term low carbon energy strategy with economic development goals, the central government has set and broken down the carbon and energy intensity reduction target at the level of individual provinces.  Motivated by the context characterized by heterogeneous energy strategy and economic development paths in each of these provinces, this paper addresses three main questions.  1) does energy play a role in promoting provincial growth together with the physical and human capital.  2) how and to what extent the disaggregate energy source is responsible for economic growth.  and 3) what is the causal direction between total and disaggregate energy use and growth of economy in each of these provinces, if any.  The answers will provide rich policy implications for a better understanding of interaction between localized development path and energy conservation to set an implementable emission reduction target for sustainable development.  In the literature, many scholars examine the cointegration and Granger causal link between energy use and economic development in China using national time series data (Shiu and Lam, 2004.  Zhang and Cheng, 2009.  Bloch et al. , 2012).  While country level studies provide some insights on the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth, they have at least two major limitations.  In terms of method, the power of unit root and cointegration tests in time series studies is low due to a short time span (Campbell and Perron, 1991).  the conventional causality tests using time series have a high risk of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis of no cointegration (Yalta and Cakar, 2012) and therefore can lead to inaccurate conclusions on the direction of causality.  In addition, previous studies using national-level time series ignore the signiﬁcant heterogeneity and interdependence across Chinese provinces.  The endowments of energy resources in China are unevenly distributed.  for example, coal is mainly reserved in Shanxi, while oil and natural gas are mainly in Xinjiang and Sichuan. 2 The economic structure and energy intensity have large variations across provinces as well.  Fig.  1 illustrates the provincial differences in economic structure and energy intensity in year 2014.  The blue, red and green bars indicate the share of gross output values from the primary, the secondary and the tertiary industry, respectively.  The purple solid line depicts the energy intensity for each of the 30 provinces (Tibet excluded).  The stacked bar chart shows that output from the tertiary industry exceeds that from the primary and the secondary industries for coastal rich provinces such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hainan, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.  Among the 30 provinces, there are eight resource-rich provinces such as Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang with energy intensity above the average which is indicated by “*”.  Compared with existing studies, by using the provincial panel, our study offers improved test power over conventional time series methods, which also enables us to account for marked heterogeneity in economic structure and energy distribution across provinces.  The growth-energy nexus analysis at a disaggregated level matters for local regulators to evaluate and act on differentiated strategies of energy conservation and efﬁciency enhancement, and is also vital for the central government to coordinate the regional development and efforts in reducing resource costs and emissions for speciﬁc energy source.  A limited but growing number of studies recently exploit provincial data and panel techniques to investigate the energy-growth nexus in China, albeit producing mixed results (S. S.  Wang et al. , 2011.  Fei et al. , 2011.  Zhang and Xu, 2012.  Herrerias et al. , 2013).  For example, using data from 28 provinces over the period 1995–2007, Y.  Wang et al.  (2011) and S. S.  Wang et al.  (2011) ﬁnd a uni-directional causal relationship from GDP to energy consumption.  Zhang and Xu (2012) identify the bidirectional linkage for the eastern region, while Fei et al.  (2011) conclude the growth effect that energy consumption leads to economic development for the same part of China.  While no consensus has been obtained, results from the panel analysis are relatively more reliable than that from national studies.  One shortcoming of these studies is, however, that they did not explore the impact of disaggregate energy sources on the province-speciﬁc economic growth.  therefore, conclusions made on the analysis of aggregate energy cannot be generalized to disaggregate energy within each of the administrative boundary, that is, the nexus between total energy use and local growth may not hold and be equally applied to disaggregate energy source across provinces, and thus policy suggestions based on this body of studies are hard to implement (Soytas and Sari, 2006).  The brief review highlights the importance to account for provincial heterogeneity and examine not only the aggregate energy but also the disaggregate energy sources.  This paper ﬁlls the gap that little empirical work has been conducted to examine the causal relationship between economic development and energy consumption at both the aggregate and disaggregate levels using provincial data and most recent panel econometric methods within a human-capital augmented production framework.  Furthermore, this paper is one of the ﬁrst studies that incorporate sub-national level human capital in the multivariate framework with a focus in China.  Despite the fact that human capital is a crucial input to economic growth, it only attracts attention in the broad energygrowth nexus literature very recently (Pablo-Romero and SánchezBraza, 2015.  Fang and Chang, 2016.  Fang et al. , forthcoming), probably due to lack of quality human capital data. 3 Theoretically, human capital can be linked to energy consumption through multiple channels.  First, human capital can increase income, which may then cause more energy consumption.  Second, human capital can stimulate R&D of new energy and accelerate the transition to energy-efﬁcient technologies (Li and Lin, 2016).  This mechanism contributes to the negative association between human capital and energy.  Third, if human capital is accumulated through education and campaign on energy conservative awareness among the common people, more human capital is linked to less energy consumption (Fang et al. , forthcoming).  Lastly, economic structure also matters.  With the development of human capital, economies that experience rapid industrialization and urbanization may see huge reliance on energy.  but when the country develops to a service-led economy, energy reliance may be reduced with further development of human capital (Arbex and Perobelli, 2010).  By and large, the relationship between energy and human capital is uncertain and a rigorous analysis is required.  Our contributions to the existing energy-growth nexus literature lie in three aspects.  First, we incorporate the input of human capital to the energy-augmented neoclassical production function.  Due to reasons mentioned above, human capital should not be ignored in the multivariate framework for the energy-growth analysis.  However, due to data availability or other reasons, we do not ﬁnd many studies employing this framework.  At Chinese provincial level, the data availability, particularly that for a quality measure of human capital, is even more problematic.  Fortunately, the Chinese human capital database established by the China Center for Human Capital and Labor Market Research of Central University of Finance and Economics makes this research possible.  It includes national and provincial human capital stock in both the nominal and real terms for years starting from 1985 to 2014.  The uniqueness of the data makes our paper the ﬁrst of its kind.  Second, this paper takes into consideration the cross-sectional dependence and provincial heterogeneity using the advanced panel econometric techniques and provides more reliable test results and fresh empirical evidences on the nature of the relation between economic growth and energy consumption.  Speciﬁcally, the crosssectionally augmented IPS (CIPS) test proposed by Pesaran (2007) is used to check the stationarity of the data.  Westerlund (2007)’s errorcorrection based test is bootstrapped to examine the presence of cointegrating relationship relaxing the assumption of cross-sectional independence.  Furthermore, we adopt the continuously-updated fully-modiﬁed OLS approach (Bai et al. , 2009) which is valid under the cross-sectional dependence rather than the panel heterogeneous FMOLS (Pedroni, 2001) and DOLS (Stock and Watson, 1993) to estimate the coefﬁcients of the long-run relationship.  None of the existing studies on China have employed these toolkits to avoid lack of test power and biasness of estimates when there are strong interdependences across provinces.  The presence and direction of the causality between variables are also examined using a panel bootstrap method (Emirmahmutoglu and Kose, 2011) that allows for heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence.  Third, we examine the causal relationship between economic growth and both aggregate and disaggregate energy sources that are available from the China Energy Statistical Yearbooks (various years 1995–2014), including raw coal, coke, crude oil, petroleum products (fuel oil, gasoline, diesel, kerosene), natural gas, and electricity.  This is one of the few studies that comprehensively investigate the disaggregate energy consumption types.  Rich policy recommendations based on these results are thus credibly provided.  Our results indicate strong cross-sectional dependence in the provincial panel, and we conﬁrm the presence of cointegration relationship between GDP, investment, human capital and various energy variables even after taking into consideration interdependence across provinces.  Using a continuously updated fully modiﬁed estimation proposed by Bai et al.  (2009), we ﬁnd that human capital is a crucial factor input which exerts about 2–3 times effects that investment has on GDP.  energy, both in aggregate or disaggregate forms as coal, crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas and electricity, plays a signiﬁcant role in economic development in China as well.  Therefore, both human capital and energy are indispensable in stimulating economic growth.  Using the bootstrap panel Granger causality test which is appropriate within the cross-sectional dependence framework, we ﬁnd Granger causal relationships running from GDP to petroleum products and electricity, and bi-directional relationship between GDP and coal, coke, natural gas and total energy consumption in the whole China.  For individual provinces, causal relationships vary signiﬁcantly.  This has important policy implications to especially local governments in the sense that while following the macro- and strategic policies from the central government, local governments should take initiatives and evaluate their unique stages of economic development and energy status as well as the causal relationship between the two before taking micro- and speciﬁc measures.  The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 reviews the energy proﬁle for China as a whole and the energy balance structure of the primary energy sources for each of the 30 provinces as well as the energy-growth nexus literature with a focus on China.  Section 3 provides data descriptions and a preliminary analysis.  Econometric methods are discussed in Section 4.  Main results are presented and discussed in Section 5 and the last section concludes with policy recommendations.  <Middle> An overview of Chinese energy proﬁle and energy-growth nexus studies.  2. 1.  Energy proﬁle in China.  As the world's most populous country with a fast-growing economy, China becomes increasingly inﬂuential in the world energy market with rapidly rising energy demand because of the swiftly modernizing economy and sizeable industrialization.  China becomes the world's largest global energy consumer in 2011.  It is also the world's top coal producer, consumer and the world's second-largest oil consumer behind the United States (Energy Information Administration, 2015).  This subsection ﬁrst provides an overview of the energy proﬁle for China as a whole.  Subsequently, by exploiting information from the energy balance table of the primary energy sources4 for individual provinces, we show the link of production, consumption and inter-province trade of coal, oil, gas, and electricity, using the annual average values during the period of 1995–2014.  Fig.  2 shows the annual growth rate of GDP and total energy consumption from 1980 to 2015.  Two observations are drawn from the ﬁgure.  First, there seems to be a co-movement of growth in output and energy consumption.  speciﬁcally, energy consumption growth before 1995 is slightly lagging behind economic growth, while afterwards the growth cycle in energy is moving ahead of economic growth.  To rigorously examine the relationship between the two variables, a cointegration analysis is necessary.  Second, the ﬁgure shows that the growth rate of energy consumption is slower than GDP growth rate until 2002 and later exceeds GDP growth rate within a short period of time during 2003–2005.  this suggests a clear downward trend of energy intensity (deﬁned as the ratio of energy consumption to GDP) with an interruption during 2003–2005.  The driving forces governing energy intensity change in China have been widely debated in the literature. 5 First, China's industrial structure has shifted from energy-intensive heavy industries toward export- and consumption-oriented tertiary industries (Kambara, 1992.  Huang, 1993).  Using the decomposition analysis, Song and Zheng (2012) ﬁnd that the structural change does not play a major role in reducing energy intensity while Garbaccio et al.  (1999) reach the opposite conclusion.  Using the econometric analysis and a panel dataset of 30 provinces from 2000 to 2012, Yan (2015) concludes that the structural change toward more energy-intensive industries explains the rise in energy intensity.  Zeng et al.  (2014) show that the slight increase in energy intensity since 2002 to 2005 is associated with the construction boom across the nation as well as the heavy industrialization strategy for provinces along the coast, which leads to the boosted production of energy-intensive products such as aluminum, cement and steel.  Second, though the role played by structural change in reducing energy intensity remains controversial, the previous studies seem to agree on the role played by technological progress which lowers energy consumption required to produce a speciﬁc product in a particular sector (Fisher-Vanden et al. , 2004.  Li and Lin, 2014.  Wang et al. , 2013).  Third, the market reform in the energy sector (Liao et al. , 2007.  He and Wang, 2007) improves energy efﬁciency and incentivizes the deployment of new material (Sinton and Fridley, 2000.  Wu, 2012).  Glomsrød and Wei (2005) point out since 1994 the dual-price system in the energy sector was gradually reformed and there is a deep level of marketization since then.  In addition to the main driving forces, several other studies identify alternate inﬂuential factors such as urbanization, total population, export and sectoral ownership structure to explain the nature and causes of energy intensity change in China (Yan, 2015.  Yang et al. , 2016.  Zheng et al. , 2011.  Yu, 2012).  Fig.  3 presents the consumption dynamics of three major energy sources—coal, crude oil and natural gas for 1980–2015.  We can see that China's energy consumption is dominated by coal, the energy source that China can increase in the short term and is available in many provinces.  The demand for energy increases tremendously after 2000s since joining the World Trade Organization (WTO).  This leads to an export-oriented industrial expansion and the associated rise in demands for energy, especially for coal.  An alternative driving force of the rise in energy demand, primarily for oil, is the exponential growth of motor vehicles.  From 2001 to 2014, the privately-owned cars increase from 7. 7 million to 123. 4 million, at a rate of 24% per annum (National Bureau of Statistics, 2016).  Fig.  4 portrays the shares of disaggregate energy sources in total energy consumption from 1980 to 2015.  Before the occurrence of ﬁnancial crisis in China, fossil fuels including coal, crude oil and natural gas account for 92. 5% of China's energy consumption in year 2007, followed by hydro-, nuclear and wind power.  In 2009, China pledged to cut its carbon intensity by 40%–45% by 2020 compared with the 2005 level of carbon emission per unit of GDP under pressure from international climate change negotiations.  To meet this voluntary emission reduction target, there is an upward trend in the consumption of natural gas, a relative cleaner burning alternate compared to coal and petroleum products in the industrial sector.  In fact, the share of natural gas consumption in the total energy consumption has been tripled from 1. 9% to 5. 7% during the period 1994–2014.  In comparison, the share of coal consumption has been declined from 75% to 65. 6% within the same period.  The declining trend of coal consumption, on one hand, comes from energy efﬁciency and the China's goal to increase environmental sustainability when the Chinese government plans to cap coal use to 62% of total primary energy consumption by 2020 in the commitment to reduce air pollution and carbon emission (Energy Information Administration, 2015).  On the other hand, it might be attributed to slower economic growth especially since 2012 as ﬁxed asset investment, industrial production and exports declined (Cattaneo et al. ,Next, we present the energy balance tables detailing production, consumption and trade for each of the primary disaggregate energy sources—coal, oil, natural gas and electricity— individually so as to lay out the background information before the empirical analysis.  2. 1. 1.  Coal.  The underpricing of coal products and abundant domestic stocks during the central planning era6 leads China to rely heavily on coal consumption (Crompton and Wu, 2005), with the share of coal in total energy consumption hovering around 70% during 1985–2011.  The share starts to shrink from the beginning of the eleventh Five Year Plan (2006–2010).  As mentioned above, this might be attributed to much of China's effort to promote energy efﬁciency and emission reduction by clamping down on its downstream user (mainly heavy industry) and limiting the growth of coal use. 7 The downward trend in the share of coal consumption is also associated with the economic slowdown in coal-consuming sectors, moderate demand growth of electricity, and price reform in the coal market.  Table A1 in the appendix presents the annual average supply, demand, and trade of coal during the period of 1995–2014 across Chinese provinces located in seven different regions. 8 There are three balance relationships.  (1) The total primary energy supply equals the sum of indigenous production, trade balance and the stock change, where the trade balance measures the difference between imports and exports.  (2) The total energy consumption equals loss plus end energy consumption less of the net input value during the transformation process.  (3) The statistical difference accounts for the error between total supply and total consumption.  The last column reports the annual average ratio of trade balance to the total energy supply during 1995–2014.  A negative value implies that on average a province is the producer and exporter of coal.  a positive value shows that a province is scarce of and highly dependent on coal imports.  Among the 30 provinces, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Ningxia and Henan in the northern and central part of China contain and export most of their coal resources.  Guizhou is the only southern province which has abundant coal resources.  In comparison, Hainan, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong and Zhejiang located along the eastern coastal line are economically developed, but N90% of supply of coal depends on imports from inland provinces.  2. 1. 2.  Oil.  Although coal is the dominant energy source, oil and petroleum products are also essential.  China's oil demand growth is boosted by several factors, such as economic growth, trade, reﬁning capabilities, petroleum inventory building and shift of transportation sector (Energy Information Administration, 2015).  The increase in the number of passenger vehicles with the rising middle class in China, along with expansion of petrochemical industries might be one of the most important factors driving the consumption of oil and petroleum products in China, among which diesel and gasoline dominate other oil types such as fuel oil and kerosene (see Fig.  5).  The share of oil in the total energy consumption, as shown in Fig.  4, peaks at 22% in year 2000.  After 2010 the annual growth of oil consumption slows down, reﬂecting the impacts of global ﬁnancial crisis and economic downturn as well as China's efforts to reduce capacity overbuilding and excessive investment in pollution-intensive industries.  Different from the coal consumption met by the indigenous production, China as the world's second largest oil consuming country (Energy Information Administration, 2016), heavily relies on oil imports and searching for new reserves in Tarim Basin in the northwest and offshore in the South China Sea.  Fig.  6 provides a graphical illustration of oil consumption, production and the surplus ratio in China during the period of 1965–2015.  It shows that the surplus ratio turns from positive to negative from 1994 and the demand-supply gap enlarges since then.  In Table A2 of the appendix, we present oil production, consumption and trade across Chinese provinces.  All variables are measured as the annual average during the period of 1995–2014.  Total supply of oil comprises of indigenous production, import net of export, and the stock change.  Total energy consumption is decomposed into the net input, loss in the oil production and transmission and end consumption in varied sectors such as farming, forestry and animal, industry, construction, transportation, storage, postal services and telecommunications, wholesale, retail, catering, and residential consumption.  Sorted by the ratio of trade balance to total supply, Table A2 shows that the top ﬁve exporters of oil are provinces of Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shaanxi and Tianjin, all located in the northern part of China.  Shandong, in close proximity to the Bohai bay and East China Sea is the second largest oil producer just after Heilongjiang, while on average still depends on imports to ﬁll the gap between supply and demand.  Guangdong is the only southern province rich in oil resource with N50% of supply depending on imports.  It is worth noting that more than half of Chinese provinces including the developed ones such as Beijing, Shanghai and Jiangsu, with total oil consumption heavily dependent on imports.  2. 1. 3.  Natural gas.  The natural gas reserve distributes in nine basins including Tarim (Xinjiang), Sichuan, Ordos (Inner Mongolia) and Qaidam (Qinghai), accounting for around 84% of the total recoverable resources in China.  With the development and formation of national and regional natural gas pipeline networks, China's natural gas consumption surges from 173 million m3 in 1994 to 1869 million m3 in 2014, with an average annual growth rate of about 12%.  Based on energy balance data from China Energy Statistical Yearbooks (1996–2015), Table A3 in the appendix shows that among the top ﬁve gas consumers, Sichuan, Xinjiang and Chongqing are self-dependent and export to other provinces, while economically developed large consumers such as Beijing, Jiangsu and Shanghai depend on imports.  Notably, Guangdong stands out as the largest producer of gas in the south and export to its close neighbors Guangxi, Hunan and Fujian.  2. 1. 4.  Electricity.  Historically, the electric power industry experiences rehabilitation and reconstruction during 1949–1951 since the establishment of the country's ﬁrst generation plant in Shanghai, and then a slow expansion in big cities along the coastal regions during the ﬁrst and second ﬁve-year plans (1953–1962) before the Cultural Revolution.  Power shortages and a short fall in coal supply were associated with the social turmoil during 1966– 1975, bringing adverse effects on the rest of the economy (Shiu and Lam, 2004).  With the open door policy in 1978 that leads to a series of structural reforms and injection of market incentives, the fast growth of the electricity industry started from early 1980s and continued into late 1990s.  Because of the large size of domestic reserves, coal among other fossil fuels, makes up almost 80% of power generation sources (NBS, 2014).  Oil-ﬁred generation remains a small portion.  Natural gas serves as a fuel source for power primarily in the southern coastal cities where gas is more competitive and available (Energy Information Administration, 2015).  In the long run, China is determined to shift from coal-ﬁred to more gas-ﬁred power generation, spending efforts has the highest trade dependence ratio.  Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang and Hebei are large consumers of electricity while b20% of supply depends on imports from other provinces.  2. 2.  A brief review on energy-growth nexus studies.  The relationship between economic growth and energy consumption has long been a controversial topic with rich implications in the design of conservative and efﬁcient energy policies.  The traditional economic growth theory takes the role of energy in the production process as being neutral (Solow, 1956.  Galor, 2005).  This perspective is challenged by Cleveland et al.  (1984) from the biophysical and ecological perspective, by Stern (1997) with thermodynamic concerns and by Beaudreau (1995) from an engineering perspective.  They argue that an engineering production is infeasible without energy input, which attracts great attention from energy and ecological economists to reexamine the GDP-energy nexus in a systematic way (Kander and Stern, 2012.  Bhattacharya et al. , 2016).  Interestingly, even within the economics discipline, the dispute has been far from settled with results highly sensitive to the scope of study, the period of time, the data structure, the analysis framework, the number of variables and the methodology used.  Since the seminal work by Kraft and Kraft (1978), the topic has invoked a large volume of relevant studies for the developed and developing countries at both the aggregated and disaggregated levels (Ozturk, 2010).  In this sub-section, we restrict the review on energy-growth nexus studies that have a focus on China.  Table 1 provides a summary of these studies in chronicle order by type of data used.  causality results between growth and both aggregate energy and disaggregate energy, together with time period covered, are listed.  As shown in Table 1, Shiu and Lam (2004) may be one of the earliest studies that have used the error-correction models to examine the presence and direction of causal relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth in China.  Using annual data from 1971 to 2000, they ﬁnd that electricity consumption Granger causes GDP but not vice versa.  This is to increase gas supply, regulate coal use, and improve gas transmission infrastructure.  China is also aggressively investing in hydro, nuclear, wind and solar-power as key sources of renewable energy generation.  In 2014, the share of hydro, nuclear and wind power in total energy production and consumption has reached 13. 3% and 11. 3%, respectively (NBS, 2014).  Fig.  7 shows electricity consumption by sector in 2014.  The industrial sector accounts for 72% of China's electricity consumption (NBS, 2014), followed by 13% share of consumption in residential and 6% in other sectors.  Wholesale, retail, accommodation and catering sectors account for 4% of total electricity consumption.  agriculture, forestry and ﬁshery consume 2%.  transportation, storage, postal service sector plus the construction sector consumes the remaining 3%.  In the electricity ﬂow table (Table A4), about half of provinces are exporters of electricity with negative values reported in the last column, among which Anhui is the only eastern province that exports.  Beijing later conﬁrmed by Yuan et al.  (2007) who conduct sectoral analysis on data from 1978 to 2004.  Using the same method and a longer time span covering 1953–2002, Zou and Chau (2006) investigate the relationship between oil consumption and GDP in China and ﬁnd that oil consumption is an important predictor of economic growth in both the short and long run.  They explain that this is mainly caused by the enormous use of oil in industrial sectors.  Different from the above two, Soytas and Sari (2006) extend the bivariate framework to a multivariate case that is built on the neoclassical production function and use the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) (TY in short) for causality test.  They ﬁnd no causal relationship between energy and economic growth in China.  Similar to Soytas and Sari (2006), Zhang and Cheng (2009), Y.  Wang et al.  (2011), S. S.  Wang et al.  (2011), and Shahbaz et al.  (2013) also study the relationship between aggregate energy consumption and economic growth using nationallevel data, but different methods and frameworks are adopted.  Speciﬁcally, Zhang and Cheng (2009) incorporate carbon emission in the framework, use the TY method and ﬁnd that neither carbon emissions nor energy consumption leads to economic growth.  Y.  Wang et al.  (2011a), S. S.  Wang et al.  (2011) use energy-augmented production function and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL in short) bounds testing approach and ﬁnd energy Granger causing economic growth in both short and long run.  Shahbaz et al.  (2013) incorporate ﬁnancial development, trade, and capital, adopt ARDL, and also evidence the unidirectional relationship from energy to GDP.  However, as pointed out by Soytas and Sari (2006), conclusions made on the analysis of aggregate energy should not be generalized to disaggregate energy.  instead, the importance of various energy sources in the economy should be assessed separately before providing suggestions to policy makers.  A few studies that consider both the aggregate and disaggregate energy consumption include Yuan et al.  (2008), Herrerias et al.  (2013), Zhang and Yang (2013), Bloch et al.  (2015), Long et al.  (2015), and Fang and Wolski (2016).  All the researchers, except Herrerias et al.  (2013), use the national annual series.  While no consensus has reached on the presence and direction of Granger causality between individual disaggregated energy type and economic growth, the policy implications drawn from these works have been largely enriched.  Another deﬁciency of these studies exists in the aggregate national level data.  As pointed out by Yalta and Cakar (2012), analysis using national level data has a limited potential to observe the complex causal linkages between energy use and economic growth in China.  Using various framework and econometric methods applied to national series, they ﬁnd results from 53 out of 60 models support no causal relationship between energy and economic growth.  The reason is that causality tests based on time series data has a high risk falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no causality when the sample size is small.  To avoid the over-rejection and uncover the causal relationship, research should be performed on provincial panel data.  This argument is echoed in Ozturk's (2010) thorough review of about 100 papers with time series framework.  More recent work in China shifts from time series analysis of national level data to panel approaches applied to provincial data, with the advance of panel econometric methodologies.  For example, Y.  Wang et al.  (2011), S. S.  Wang et al.  (2011), using data from 28 provinces over the period 1995–2007, ﬁnd that GDP Granger causes energy consumption but not vice versa.  Zhang and Xu (2012) identify the bidirectional linkage for the eastern region using data from 1995 to 2008, while Fei et al.  (2011) using data from 1985 to 2007 show that only the growth effect is signiﬁcant for the eastern part of China.  Li and Leung (2012) use data from 23 provinces for a period of 1985–2008 to reexamine the causal link between coal and GDP, and ﬁnd heterogeneous effects across regions, i. e. , bi-directional relationship in the coastal and central regions but uni-directional relationship from GDP to coal in the western region.  Akkemik et al.  (2012) also take into account the panel heterogeneity and evidence that causality holds for 19 provinces from GDP to energy and in the opposite direction for 14 provinces.  However, none of the studies investigates the causal relationship for various disaggregated energy sources for each of the provinces.  To summarize, it is important to perform the energy-growth causality analysis using Chinese provincial data of not only the aggregate energy consumption but also the disaggregate energy types.  To the best of our knowledge, Herrerias et al.  (2013) is so far the only paper that has almost done so.  They use the bi-variate framework to examine the causal relationship between energy and economic growth across 27 provinces from 1995 to 2009.  They discuss the total energy consumption and disaggregate energy types into coal, coke, crude oil and electricity except for gas, and ﬁnd the uni-directional causation from economic growth to energy consumption from 1999 to 2009.  Our paper attempts to add more evidence in this regard that uses provincial panel data to examine the causal link between individual energy sources and economic development for China as a whole and in each of the provinces.  Different from Herrerias et al.  (2013) and all other empirical studies in China, we introduce an innovative factor human capital to the theoretical framework.  The endogenous growth theory developed by Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988) emphasizes the role of human capital as the main source of growth, but it has only been considered in the energy-growth nexus literature until very recently for cross-country analysis (Pablo-Romero and Sánchez-Braza, 2015.  Fang and Chang, 2016).  Our paper is one of the ﬁrst that includes human capital into the energy-growth nexus analysis in China.  This is of vital importance for China as evidenced by Whalley and Zhao (2013) that human capital contributes N38% of GDP growth during 1979– 1998 and plays a larger role since 1999 following a major education expansion.  In this paper, using the panel Granger causality test (Emirmahmutoglu and Kose, 2011) and the continuously-updated fully-modiﬁed estimates (Bai et al. , 2009) that allow for cross-sectional dependence, we aim to provide fresh empirical evidence to reexamine the heterogeneous linkages between energy consumption and economic growth at individual provinces for different sources of energy.  Local energy policy implications will be informed and shaped by regional heterogeneity and the provincespeciﬁc energy mix.  3.  Data description.  This paper uses an augmented neoclassical production function to explore the cointegration and causal relationship between economic growth and energy use.  Therefore, we use GDP, physical capital, human capital and energy in the multivariate framework. 9 Data used in this paper are collected from three sources.  The ﬁrst source is China Energy Statistical Yearbooks (various years, 1996–2015) from which the total energy consumption10 and disaggregate energy consumption including coal, coke, crude oil, petroleum products (which consist of fuel oil, gasoline, diesel, kerosene), natural gas, and electricity at provincial levels are obtained.  Total energy consumption is measured in 10,000 tons of standard coal equivalent.  consumption of coal, coke, crude oil, and petroleum products are measured in million tons, and units for natural gas and electricity are million cubic meters and billion kWh respectively.  The second data source is China Statistical Yearbooks (various year, 1996–2015) where we have access to nominal GDP, ﬁxed asset investment and population.  The nominal GDP is converted to real GDP in 1995 constant prices using year-on-year GDP indices.  Population is 9 Similar to Soytas and Sari (2006) who used the supply-side approach to study the energy-growth nexus, no other control variables are included.  Within a multivariate model with too many controls, the concern is regarding over-parameterization and loss of degrees of freedom which can lead to estimation error (Smyth and Narayan, 2015).  10 Total energy consumption comprises of the ﬁnal energy consumption, the loss during energy transformation as well as the loss of that during the course of energy transport, distribution and storage caused by any objective reason.  used to generate variables in per-capital form. 11 Though physical capital stock is preferred in the theoretical framework, and can be estimated using ﬁxed asset investment and the perpetual inventory method with the assumption of a constant depreciation rate (Zhang et al. , 2004), we decide to use ﬁxed asset investment as a proxy of capital stock for two reasons.  First, physical capital stock is hard to measure and collect.  and that estimated from the perpetual inventory method is incomparable and subject to estimation biasness (Berlemann and Wesselhöft, 2014). 12 Second, capital stock and investment are closely related, and it is not uncommon to use gross ﬁxed capital formation as a proxy in the growth related literature.  Examples include Sharma and Dhakal (1994), Lee and Huang (2002), Lee (2005), Soytas and Sari (2009), and Zhang and Cheng (2009).  Lastly, human capital is obtained from the China Human Capital Index Report 2016 published by the China Center for Human Capital and Labor Market Research of Central University of Finance and Economics.  The 2016 Report provides detailed human capital information such as total human capital, human capital per capita and human capital index at both the national and provincial level starting from 1985 up to 2014.  It is calculated using a modiﬁed Jorgenson-Fraumeni lifetime income approach (Jorgenson and Fraumeni, 1989) based on both the survey and macro data.  We use the provincial real per capita human capital data for a period of 1995–2014 and convert them into the 1995 constant prices.  Using data available from the three sources, our panel covers 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions (provinces in short hereafter) and a period ranging from 1995 to 2014. 13 The 30 provinces include Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Hebei, Inner Mongolia in North China.  Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang in Northeast China.  Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi and Shandong in East China.  Henan, Hubei and Hunan in the central.  Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan in South China.  Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan in Southwest China.  and Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang in Northwest China.  Table 2 lists the deﬁnitions and summary statistics of these variables.  All the variables, real GDP, ﬁxed asset investment, human capital and energy consumption, are expressed in per-capita logarithm forms denoted by InGDP, InInv, InHC and lnE where E refers to one of the aggregate energy and disaggregate energy types, i. e. , Energy, Coal, Coke, Crude Oil, Petroleum Products, Gas, and Electricity.  Using the provincial ArcGIS shapeﬁle, we visualize the real GDP per capita and the share of energy consumption across provinces in Fig.  8.  The gradual colors from dark to light indicate the decreasing magnitude of per capita real GDP.  The size of the grey bubble represents how large the share of energy consumption is for each of the provinces over the national aggregate.  It clearly indicates the huge variance across provinces in economic development as well as the speciﬁc dependence of energy.  Strong correlation is identiﬁed between output and energy consumption, which is highly visible along the coastal line of China in the provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong.  This is also true for central provinces such as Henan and for western provinces like Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Sichuan.  4.  Econometric methodologies.  This paper aims to answer two main research questions.  First, whether the variables GDP, physical and human capital and energy consumption are cointegrated and what is the magnitude of output elasticity with respect to each factor input if there is a cointegrating relationship.  Second, whether there is a Granger causal link between energy consumption and economic growth.  if so, what is the direction of the Granger causality.  To answer these questions, we incorporate human capital and energy consumption into the following neoclassical production function where Y is the real output per capita, and K, HC, E are factor inputs of per capita physical capital, human capital and energy, respectively.  The subscript i denotes the Chinese province i and t denotes year t.  Using log-linearization, we can rewrite it as ln Y it ¼ β0 þ β1 ln Kit þ β2 ln HCit þ β3 ln Eit þ εit where β0 is the intercept, β1, β2 and β3 are the coefﬁcients which measures the output elasticities with respect to physical capital, human capital and energy consumption, respectively, and εit is the error term.  For the ﬁrst query, we employ the panel cointegration method proposed by Westerlund (2007) and continuously-updated fully modiﬁed estimator (Bai et al. , 2009) which enable us to address the potential issue of cross-sectional dependence.
