 Introduction Buy-side analysts play an important role in equity markets because their research directly impacts the investing decisions of portfolio managers (Cheng et al. , 2006.  Frey and Herbst, 2014.  Rebello and Wei, 2014).  These analysts usually work for an investment ﬁrm (e. g. , mutual fund, hedge fund, pension fund), and they perform their research activities exclusively for the ﬁrm that employs them.  In contrast to sell-side analysts whose stock recommendations are distributed widely to their clients and who often receive coverage in the business press, buy-side analysts' stock recommendations are not available to anyone outside their own ﬁrm.  Thus, although buy-side analysts are much closer than sell-side analysts to the ultimate investing decision, they are rarely the subject of academic research.  The purpose of this study is to expand our understanding of the activities of buy-side analysts and their role in the capital markets.  We survey 344 buy-side equity analysts employed by 181 institutional investment ﬁrms and conduct 16 detailed followup interviews on a wide range of topics.  We examine the factors that determine their compensation, their motivation to issue proﬁtable stock recommendations, the inputs to their stock recommendations, the frequency and value of their interactions with company management, and their assessments of ﬁnancial reporting quality.
