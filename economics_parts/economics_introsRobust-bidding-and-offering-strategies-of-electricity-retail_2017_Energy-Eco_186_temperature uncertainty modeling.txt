 1.  Introduction In order to supply end-user customers and determine optimum selling price for expected proﬁt maximization, uncertainty modeling of market price and demand should be done by retailer (Growe-Kuska et al. , 2003).  The retailer can determine the selling price based on ﬁxed price, time-of-use price or real-time price.  Finally, the retailer should prepare the curves for day-ahead market to purchase (sell) power from (to) the power market.  It should be noted that retailer can use the power market, bilateral contracts, self-dispatchable distributed generation units (DGs) and renewable energy sources (PV systems & wind turbines) to supply demand of customers.  But, sometimes it is possible that demand of customers is low.  Therefore, surplus energy from renewable energy sources and DG units can be sold to power market by retailer.  Therefore, in addition to determining the optimal bidding curves, optimal offering curves of retailer are obtained based on proposed robust optimization approach in the proposed paper.  1. 1.  Literature review.  The researches about determination of retail price by retailer are generally classiﬁed into three time periods containing long-term, midterm and short-term planning.  The review of related researches is categorized based on objective function, type of selling price determination, solution methodology and uncertainty modeling.  In long-term planning, Ref.  (Nojavan et al.  (2017d) minimizes total cost without pricing, uncertainty modeling, demand response program (DRP) and smart grid technology and maximization of expected proﬁt considering uncertainty modeling using scenario-based stochastic model is provided in Ref.  Ahmadi et al.  (2013) without pricing.  It should be mentioned that used ROA in Khojasteh and Jadid (2015) and Nojavan and Aalami (2015) is related to mid-term planning of retailer in which only the bidding curve has been obtained without pricing while the proposed ROA is used in this paper in short-term planning of retailer to obtain the bidding and offering curves for the power market under ﬁxed pricing (FP), time-of-use pricing (TOU) and realtime pricing (RTP).  Furthermore, short-term planning of retailer is reviewed in Hatami et al.  (2009), Nojavan et al.  (2015b), 2017c, Charwand et al.  (2015), Mahmoudi-Kohan et al.  (2010a), Hajati et al.  (2011), and Fleten and Pettersen (2005).  These researches are organized similar to mid-term planning.  The objective functions of short-term planning are profit maximization (Hatami et al. , 2009.  Nojavan et al. , 2015b, 2017c.  Mahmoudi-Kohan et al. , 2010a.  Hajati et al. , 2011.  Fleten and Pettersen, 2005) or costminimization (Charwand et al. , 2015.  Mahmoudi-Kohan et al. , 2010a.  Nojavan et al. , 2017c).  Unlike mid-term planning, realtime pricing (Hajati et al. , 2011.  Nojavan et al. , 2017c) as well as fixed pricing (Hatami et al. , 2009.  Mahmoudi-Kohan et al. , 2010a.  Fleten and Pettersen, 2005) and time-of-use pricing (Nojavan et al. , 2015b) are used as different types of selling price in short-term planning.  Also, Stackelberg game (Nojavan et al. , 2017c), genetic algorithm (Charwand et al. , 2015) or GAMS (Hatami et al. , 2009.  Nojavan et al. , 2015b.  Mahmoudi-Kohan et al. , 2010a.  Hajati et al. , 2011.  Fleten and Pettersen, 2005) are used to solve the problem.  Furthermore, in Nojavan et al.  (2015b), Charwand et al.  (2015), and Hajati et al.  (2011) the uncertainty modeling is not considered.  Also, scenario based method and IGDT are used as uncertainty modeling approaches in Hatami et al.  (2009), Fleten and Pettersen (2005), Nojavan et al.  (2017c) and Mahmoudi-Kohan et al.  (2010a), respectively.  1. 2.  Aims, scope, procedure and contributions.  In this paper, the electricity market price uncertainty implies that the final profit of the retailer is unknown.  Therefore, input parameters uncertainty modeling is necessary.  Since forecasted price is “probably wrong”, we rely on the minimum and maximum limits of electricity market price versus the real estimation (Kettunen et al. , 2010).  Moreover, we incorporate these upper and lower bounds for the forecasted price with robust optimization approach (as explained in Ref.  Gabriel et al. , 2002) to create the bidding (offering) curves of retailer for optimal bidding (offering) to the day-ahead market.  The proﬁt of retailer can be modeled as a MIP problem considering the forecasted price.  If the upper and lower bounds for the forecasted price are considered instead of price forecast, the optimal bidding (offering) strategy can be reformulated as an robust mixed integer linear programming (RMIP) problem (Gabriel et al. , 2002).  Regarding the upper and lower bounds of price, the proposed approach conducts to robust decision within the deﬁned price limits.  This robustness decision is important and contributes to the price-taker retailer which optimal bidding and offering strategies are obtained based on the proposed robust optimization approach.  Also, robust scheduling of alternative energy sources containing pool market, bilateral contracts, DG units and energy storage system is obtained based on the proposed robust optimization approach.  Furthermore, scenario-based stochastic framework is used for uncertainty modeling of demand, wind speed, irradiation and temperature.  Based on the explanation above, the novelty and contributions of this research can be listed as follows.  1) Optimal bidding and offering curves of retailer are obtained based on the robust optimization approach.  2) Robust scheduling of alternative energy sources is evaluated based on the proposed approach.  The paper is organized as follows.  Optimal selling price determination for the retailer under uncertainties is modeled in Section 2.  Background of robust optimization approach is presented in Section 3.  The proposed robust models as well as the flowchart algorithm for obtaining the optimal bidding (offering) curves of retailer are provided in Section 4.  The results of three case studies have been presented and analyzed in Section 5.  Finally, the relevant conclusions are presented in Section 6.  Furthermore, short-term planning of retailer is reviewed in Hatami et al.  (2009), Nojavan et al.  (2015b), 2017c, Charwand et al.  (2015), Mahmoudi-Kohan et al.  (2010a), Hajati et al.  (2011), and Fleten and Pettersen (2005).  These researches are organized similar to mid-term planning.  The objective functions of short-term planning are proﬁt maximization (Hatami et al. , 2009.  Nojavan et al. , 2015b, 2017c.  Mahmoudi-Kohan et al. , 2010a.  Hajati et al. , 2011.  Fleten and Pettersen, 2005) or cost minimization (Charwand et al. , 2015.  Mahmoudi-Kohan et al. , 2010a.  Nojavan et al. , 2017c).  Unlike mid-term planning, realtime pricing (Hajati et al. , 2011.  Nojavan et al. , 2017c) as well as ﬁxed pricing (Hatami et al. , 2009.  Mahmoudi-Kohan et al. , 2010a.  Fleten and Pettersen, 2005) and time-of-use pricing (Nojavan et al. , 2015b) are used as different types of selling price in short-term planning.  Also, Stackelberg game (Nojavan et al. , 2017c), genetic algorithm (Charwand et al. , 2015) or GAMS (Hatami et al. , 2009.  Nojavan et al. , 2015b.  Mahmoudi-Kohan et al. , 2010a.  Hajati et al. , 2011.  Fleten and Pettersen, 2005) are used to solve the problem.  Furthermore, in Nojavan et al.  (2015b), Charwand et al.  (2015), and Hajati et al.  (2011) the uncertainty modeling is not considered.  Also, scenario based method and IGDT are used as uncertainty modeling approaches in Hatami et al.  (2009), Fleten and Pettersen (2005), Nojavan et al.  (2017c) and Mahmoudi-Kohan et al.  (2010a), respectively.  1. 2.  Aims, scope, procedure and contributions.  In this paper, the electricity market price uncertainty implies that the ﬁnal proﬁt of the retailer is unknown.  Therefore, input parameters uncertainty modeling is necessary.  Since forecasted price is “probably wrong”, we rely on the minimum and maximum limits of electricity market price versus the real estimation (Kettunen et al. , 2010).  Moreover, we incorporate these upper and lower bounds for the forecasted price with robust optimization approach (as explained in Ref.  1. 3.  Structure of the paper.  The paper is organized as follows.  Optimal selling price determination for the retailer under uncertainties is modeled in Section 2.  Background of robust optimization approach is presented in Section 3.  The proposed robust models as well as the ﬂowchart algorithm for obtaining the optimal bidding (offering) curves of retailer are provided in Section 4.  The results of three case studies have been presented and analyzed in Section 5.  Finally, the relevant conclusions are presented in Section 6.  <Middle> Problem formulation.  The objective function is to maximize the expected profit of the retailer (revenue minus cost) in day-ahead market.  The revenue is obtained from selling energy to the end users.  Also, the total procurement cost of retailer includes the purchased costs of energy from pool market, bilateral contracts and dispatchable distributed generation units (DGs).  The energy procurement cost due to bilateral contracts is expressed by Eq.  (1).  The allowable limits of procured power through bilateral contract and total energy procurement from bilateral contracts are expressed in Eqs.  (2) and (3), respectively (Nojavan et al. , 2017b).  A piecewise linear operation cost modeling of DG units is expressed in Eq.  (5) according to Conejo et al.  (2005).  The technical constraints are presented in Eqs.  (6)–(13).  The purchased energy from DGs is limited by Eqs.  (6) and (7).  Also, the ramp up/down rate limits are expressed in constraints (Eqs.  (8) and (9)), respectively.  Finally, Eqs.  (10) and (11) describe theminimumup/down time constraints.  Also, the auxiliary variables Upi, j and Dni, j are defined in Eqs.  (12) and (13) for linear modeling of minimum up/down time of DGs (Aalami and Nojavan,The available power ofwind turbine and PV systemcan be calculated using Eqs.  (14) and (15) according to Conejo et al.  (2005), respectively.  Also, it should be noted that the Weibull distribution curve is used to generate scenarios for wind speed and normal distribution curve is used to generate scenarios for radiation and temperature uncertainty modeling in stochastic model.  The technical constraints of ESS are presented in Eqs.
