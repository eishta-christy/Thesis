How ﬁrms disseminate information to ﬁnancial markets, how the market responds to this information, and how the
mechanism of information dissemination affects the market response are of great importance (e. g. , Grossman and Stiglitz,
1980; Merton, 1987).  Perhaps the most common and most important vehicle by which ﬁrms release information to the
market is through their earnings announcements.  In particular, one of the decision variables is the exact timing of the
earnings release.  If the timing of the release affects the market's response to ﬁrms’ earnings, then ﬁrms may release news
strategically, for instance, to hide bad news.  Prior studies examining the choice of weekday and, separately, time during the
day for earnings announcements show that there is a higher concentration of bad news on Friday than on other weekdays
(Penman, 1987; Damodaran, 1989; DellaVigna and Pollet, 2009; Doyle and Magilke, 2009; deHaan, Shevlin, and Thornock,
2015) and in the evening (after trading hours) than at other times of day (Patell and Wolfson, 1982; Doyle and Magilke,
2009; deHaan Name, 2015).  Recent studies have recognized that the mere concentration of bad news on Friday and in the
evening is not sufﬁcient to establish the existence of strategic announcement timing.  Doyle and Magilke consider opportunistic announcement switching and ﬁnd no evidence that managers switch announcements of bad earnings news to
Friday or evening.  deHaan, Shevlin, and Thornock analyze variation in investor attention and ﬁnd evidence consistent with
rational strategic announcing in the evening but not on Friday. 
Our study extends the existing literature and contributes to the debate of whether and when ﬁrms strategically
announce their earnings news in two ways.  First, because ﬁrms choose the weekday and time of their announcements
jointly, we introduce the analysis of day-time combinations to the literature on opportunistic announcement timing.  Second, we provide new implications of strategic announcing, with a special focus on whether managers have potential
beneﬁts from their announcement timing. 
The analysis of announcement timing at the level of day-time combinations provides us with new insights about
managers’ strategic timing behavior.  The higher concentration of bad news on Friday and, separately, in the evening found in
the prior studies leads to a natural conjecture: Announcements on Friday evenings, which are the intersection of Fridays and
evenings, have the worst news and, thus, are the most susceptible to opportunistic announcing behavior.  This conjecture is
also consistent with both the popular wisdom that ﬁrms and even government agencies tend to release bad news on Friday
afternoon after 4 PM (Penman, 1987) and common knowledge in the ﬁnancial industry that analysts and other professional
investors are less likely to be at work on Friday evenings (e. g. , Quenqua, 2010).  We ﬁnd that Friday evening announcements
indeed contain by far the worst news of all day-time combinations. 
In support of the strategic announcing hypothesis, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms switch to Friday evening when they have bad news.  A
host of additional ﬁndings concerning the post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD), insider trading, delistings, and conference
calls point out that strategic announcing occurs only on Friday evening.  We also ﬁnd that managers beneﬁt from their strategic
choice through reduced market scrutiny and delayed market response to news announced on Friday evening.  The PEAD after
Friday evening announcements allows managers to proﬁt through post-announcement buying and selling of the company's stock
in the direction of the surprise.  The delayed market response to bad news can also provide managers with greater job security
and beneﬁts associated with continued employment in the ﬁrm (Kothari Name, 2009). 
To analyze day-time combinations, we divide earnings announcements into three time-of-day slots—morning (between
midnight and 9:30 AM), during-trading (between 9:30 AM and 4 PM), and evening (between 4PM and midnight)—and ﬁve
weekdays, which creates a matrix of 15 timing cells.  We use a comprehensive dataset of earnings announcement timestamps for the period from 1999 to 2013, which we hand-collect from newswires to avoid the systematic errors in IBES
timestamps (Bradley Name, 2014; Michaely Name, 2014).  The timing cell resolution allows us to uncover new patterns in
opportunistic announcements, and it also puts in perspective the well-documented results regarding bad news on Friday
and in the evening.  We ﬁnd that Friday evening announcements are responsible for a disproportionately large portion of the
bad news on Fridays documented in the literature—Friday evening announcements constitute 17% of Friday announcements
but produce one third of the negative difference in earnings surprise between Fridays and other weekdays.
