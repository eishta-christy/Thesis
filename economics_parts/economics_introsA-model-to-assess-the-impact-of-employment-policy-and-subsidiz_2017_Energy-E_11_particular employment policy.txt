 National oil companies (NOCs), that have the government as their major ownership, control most of the international oil reserves.  In the early 1970s, NOCs controlled slightly more than 10% of the world’s oil and gas reserves (Leis et al. , 2012).  By the end of 2000s, NOCs controlled 73% of oil reserves and 65% of gas reserves (Victor et al. , 2011).  The nature of the NOC’s ownership alters its objectives, and directly inﬂuence the public policies and incentives faced by company’s managers (Vickers and Yarrow, 1988).  Despite the importance of the effects of ownership, research on oil and gas companies is limited.  In fact, the literature has compared the technical eﬃciency between NOCs and IOCs.  Al-Obaidan and Scully (1992) state that NOCs generate between 61% and 65% of the IOCs’ revenues with the same inputs.  Victor (2007) ﬁnds that revenues from their main commercial objective are generated with more eﬃciency by IOCs than NOCs.  This author attributes these ineﬃciencies to several factors, in particular, employment policy and subsidies for delivered products, among others.  Wolf and Pollitt (2008) estimate a 3.
