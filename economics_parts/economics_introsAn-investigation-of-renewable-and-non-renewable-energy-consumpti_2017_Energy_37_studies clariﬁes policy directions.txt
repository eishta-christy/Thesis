 1.  Introduction The study of the economic growth and energy consumption nexus allows for testing of four hypotheses with strong implications for growth and energy policy.  (1) the feedback hypothesis (which indicates a bidirectional causation between the two variables).  (2) the growth hypothesis (or a unidirectional causation ﬂowing from energy to economic growth).  (3) the conservative hypothesis (or a unidirectional causation ﬂowing from economic growth to energy).  or (4) the neutrality hypothesis (no causation).  Hypothesis (2) advances the view that energy consumption promotes economic growth.  It is also widely believed that demand for energy is propelled by economic growth, giving rise to hypothesis (3).  The complementarity between energy and economic growth, as portrayed in (2) and (3), has given rise to hypothesis (1).  Hypotheses (1) and (2) posit a connection between energy policy and economic growth.  Acceptance of these hypotheses discourages restrictive energy policies, but calls for policies that promote energy efﬁciency.  The prevalence of hypotheses (3) or (4) emphasises a disconnection between energy policies and economic growth and gives a green light to energy conservation policies (Narayan, 2016). 1 While a plethora of studies examine this nexus for total energy consumption, there is an emerging strand that examines the four hypotheses explicitly for total renewables and/or non-renewables for one or more individual countries, or a panel of countries, by their level of economic development or region (see, Tiba et al. , 2016.  Bhattacharya et al. , 2016.  Chang et al. , 2015.  Salim et al. , 2014.  Pao et al. , 2014.  Marques and Fuinhas, 2012.  Apergis and Payne, 2011a, 2011b, 2010a.  Apergis et al. , 2010.  and Sardosky, 2009).  Some also examine the traditional energy consumption and economic growth nexus for different energy mixes of renewables and non-renewables (see Bloch et al. , 2015.  Long et al. , 2015.  Pao and Fu, 2013.  Marques and Fuinhas, 2012.  and Yildirim et al. , 2012).  We summarise these studies in Table 1.  By mainly using cointegration/VECM/VAR/Granger causality tests for developing and developed nations, this group of studies clariﬁes policy directions along the lines of long-term growth and energy by renewable and non-renewable energy.  While this literature shows evidence that is mixed, for both renewables and non-renewables, majority tend to ﬁnd support for the feedback hypothesis (see Table 1).
