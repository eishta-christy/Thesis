Private enforcement via shareholder litigation is important to investor protection and stock market development
(La Porta Name, 2006).  Prior literature suggests that cross-country variation in shareholder litigation threat affects the cost of
equity (Hail and Leuz, 2009; Khurana and Raman, 2004).  However, there is relatively scant evidence on how firm-level
mechanisms affect the disciplining role of shareholder litigation and therefore the cost of equity.
