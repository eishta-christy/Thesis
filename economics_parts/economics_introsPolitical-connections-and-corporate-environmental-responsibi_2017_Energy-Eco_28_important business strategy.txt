 1.  Introduction Why do ﬁrms engage in corporate environmental responsibility (CER) activities.  Understanding the incentives for CER engagement has spurred a large academic literature.  In general, there are three distinct perspectives on the determinants of CER.  The ﬁrst perspective focuses on the role of social pressure from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), suppliers, customers and regulators in CER (Delmas and Toffel, 2008).  The second perspective focuses on the ﬁrm-speciﬁc factors shaping CER, such as age, size, and ownership (Etzion, 2007.  Zeng et al. , 2010), corporate governance (Kassinis and Vafeas, 2002.  de Villiers et al. , 2011.  Walls et al. , 2012), and ﬁrm performance (Ye et al. , 2013.  Sueyoshi and Goto, 2014.  Bostian et al. , 2016).  The third perspective studies the effects of top executives on CER, which includes CEO demographic and psychological characteristics (Lewis et al. , 2014.  Petrenko et al. , 2016), CEO incentives and turnover (Deckop et al. , 2006.  Meng et al. , 2013).  Nevertheless, the literature is silent on whether political connections matter for a ﬁrm's propensity to engage in CER.  This paucity of research is somewhat surprising given the fact that many researchers have highlighted the effects of political connections on ﬁrm behavior and strategic decisions (Fisman, 2001.  Li and Atuahene-Gima, 2001.  Faccio, 2006.  Zhou, 2013), and CER is increasingly viewed as an important business strategy by researchers, investors, and society as a whole (Etzion, 2007.  de Villiers et al.
