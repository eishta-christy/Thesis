 1.  Introduction Renewable energy sources are increasingly used in order to curb CO2 emissions and mitigate climate change.  In particular, solar photovoltaic systems are being deployed at an exponential rate (see e. g. , IEA, 2016).  However, this technology has the drawback of generating electricity when residential demand is relatively low.  In fact, solar radiation is maximal around noon, when many homes are empty.  Conversely, households’ electricity usage peaks in the evening, when solar radiation is nil.  This mismatch constitutes a potential obstacle to the diffusion of electricity produced from solar sources, even if it can be mitigated in different ways.
