In a number of developing countries, biogas has been promoted as a
renewable, cleaner and cheaper energy source, especially for cooking, as
compared to alternatives such as ﬁrewood and kerosene.  For instance,
countries such as China and India have a long history of promoting biogas.  However, it is only in the last twenty ﬁve years that household
level biogas programmes, which promote construction of digesters or
tanks which convert organic waste into biogas, have spread across the
globe. 1 According to Rakotojaona (2013), N250,000 digesters have
been installed in Nepal since 1992 and about 125,000 in Vietnam in
2003.  Other Asian countries with household biogas programmes include
Cambodia and Bangladesh which launched their biogas programmes in
2006 and most recently, Pakistan and Indonesia in 2009. 2
In the Indonesian context, while a majority of the population has
access to electricity for lighting, biomass, mainly wood, remains an
important energy source for cooking (see Table 1).  At the national
level, in 2011, for 40% of Indonesian households, ﬁrewood was
their primary cooking fuel, while in East Java, 43% of households
relied mainly on ﬁrewood for cooking and about 52% used liqueﬁed
petroleum gas (LPG).  The substantial use of LPG is relatively new
and is a consequence of the country's large-scale kerosene to LPG
conversion programme (2007–2012) which was motivated by a
desire to reduce the budgetary burden of the kerosene subsidy. 3
Despite the conversion programme and other reforms which have
reduced the subsidy burden, the growth in energy demand
combined with declining domestic production and an increase in
fuel imports continues to ensure that subsidies for oil-based fuels
remain a large burden on the budget (see Asian Development
Bank, 2015; International Institute for Sustainable Development,At the same time as attempting to reduce the subsidy burden
through the conversion programme the government passed a
number of decrees and acts which recognized the importance of
promoting and developing alternative energy sources and technologies, both from an environmental and a budgetary perspective
(see SNV, 2009).
