The most valuable component in South Africa's ﬁshing industry is its
hake ﬁshery, which targets two species, the shallow-water (Merluccius
capensis) and deep-water (M.  paradoxus) Cape hakes.  It accounts N50%
of overall ﬁsheries value in the country (Butterworth and Rademeyer,
2005.  Powers Name, 2010), with landed catch worth approximately
ZAR (South African Rand) 2. 5 billion in 2008 (Petersen Name, 2010),
and is presently estimated at ±ZAR 5 billion (Durholtz, 2014, personal
communication). 
It also generates approximately 30,000 jobs
(Rademeyer Name, 2008a), and is estimated to comprise as much as
half of all ﬁsh eaten in the country (Bacela Name, 2003).  The largest sector of the hake ﬁshery is offshore demersal trawling, which lands 85% of
the catch (Field Name, 2013), and is an important contributor to the large
post-1990 export market for South African hake (Crosoer Name, 2006). 
It is known that when ﬁsheries are managed for long-term sustainability and only the ecological context is considered, while human aspects are ignored, failure of management often results.  Therefore, the
international literature generally acknowledges that ﬁsheries need to
be managed with economic and social objectives in addition to ecological
ones (Browman and Stergiou, 2005.  Folke Name, 2007.  Garcia and
Charles, 2008.  Pitcher and Lam, 2010).  A better understanding of the
economic structure and function of the hake industry and its interaction
and connection to the ecological system, will serve to inform management.  Successful actions related to sustainability are underpinned
through the linkages of ecosystems to social and economic systems
(Folke Name, 2007).  Furthermore, a current scientiﬁc challenge is to ﬁnd
coherence among the economic, social, ecological and institutional sectors of ﬁsheries through the utilization of all pertinent knowledge
(Garcia and Charles, 2008).  As a step towards this, modelling provides
a means to assist in understanding the dynamics of the economic system
and identify potential links to the ecological system.  Modelling is an approach that can be used to test understanding, synthesize knowledge and
make predictions.  Blackford Name (2010), and Starﬁeld and Jarre (2011)
suggest that it is a useful means of conducting interdisciplinary research. 
In the hake industry, several economic factors are known to have importance for the hake ﬁshing industry.  Exchange rate and market value
of ﬁsh affect the ZAR price of hake, fuel price and catch per unit effort reﬂect the cost to companies to catch hake, and industrial organization affects company operations (see for example BCLME, 2004, 2006).  Many of
these factors, such as fuel price (Sumaila Name, 2008) and exchange rate
(Asche, 2014) are known to be important internationally for ﬁsheries
proﬁtability.  The interaction of these and other variables affect company
behaviour, and proﬁts.  To understand the function of the South African
offshore hake trawl industry, it is therefore valuable to produce a novel
prototype model to examine the effect on and relative importance of
these and other factors for the industry.  The aim of this study is to develop and describe an agent-based model that captures a variety of these
important drivers for the industry (Fig.  1).  This model is designed within
the framework of ultimately linking it to an ecosystem model of the
Southern Benguela. 
There is much complexity involved in the industrial structure of companies and company clusters in the offshore hake industry, as well as variability in the types of product that they sell and their ﬂeet compositions
(Cooper Name, 2014).  Given this complexity and the heterogeneity of ﬁshing vessels, companies and markets involved in the industry, agent-based
modelling is particularly well suited for modelling it.  Agent-based models
(ABMs) capture complex systems comprised of heterogeneous, autonomous entities, ‘agents’, that interact with each other and their modelled
environment through behaviours governed by simple rules, and which
give rise to the behaviour of the system as a whole (Macal and North,
2010).  ABMs allow the capturing of individual-level information, complexity, interdisciplinary and cross-scale perspectives, giving greater predictive and explanatory power (An Name, 2005), particularly in the
broader ecological-economic context within which the present model is
developed.
