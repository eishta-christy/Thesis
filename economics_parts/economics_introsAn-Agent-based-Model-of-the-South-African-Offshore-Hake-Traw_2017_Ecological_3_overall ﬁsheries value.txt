The most valuable component in South Africa's ﬁshing industry is its
hake ﬁshery, which targets two species, the shallow-water (Merluccius
capensis) and deep-water (M.  paradoxus) Cape hakes.  It accounts N50%
of overall ﬁsheries value in the country (Butterworth and Rademeyer,
2005.  Powers Name, 2010), with landed catch worth approximately
ZAR (South African Rand) 2.
