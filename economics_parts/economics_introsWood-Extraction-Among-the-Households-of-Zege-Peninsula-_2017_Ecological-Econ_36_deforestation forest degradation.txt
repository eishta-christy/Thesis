1.  Introduction The dependence of smallholder farmers on forest resources for their sustenance and livelihoods is a major driver of deforestation and degradation of forest resources in tropical countries (Amare et al. , 2012.  FAO, 2007).  African nations lead the global list of countries with the highest deforestation rates (Naoto, 2006).  Forest degradation in Ethiopia is primarily being caused by human activities (Reusing, 1998.  Teketay et al. , 2010) and has led to considerable habitat fragmentation (Wilcove et al. , 1986), a decreasing population (Laurance et al. , 2006) and extinction of indigenous plant and animal species (Wright and Muller-Landau, 2006), as well as a decline in provision of soil protection, water conservation and favourable microclimate services (Aerts et al. , 2011).  Forest degradation is most pronounced in the highlands of the Amhara region, where natural forests and sacred groves have continuously been overexploited during past decades.  The deforestation has led to high runoff resulting in degraded landscapes, decreasing crop and livestock productivity, sedimentation of water bodies, increased food insecurity and increasingly high loss of the resource base and the attached ecosystem services (Amare et al. , 2016.  Bongers et al. , 2006.  Aerts et al. , 2016).  Zege peninsula, which is located in the Amhara Regional State, is one of the remnants of dry Afromontane forest patches in Ethiopia.  This forest has considerable religious, economic and ecological importance as it attracts local and international pilgrims, serves as a source of livelihood for local communities, and is rich in biodiversity (Alelign et al. , 2007.  Teklehaymanot and Giday, 2007).  However, recent studies have shown that unsustainable wood extraction and marketing of wood products by local populations have increased (Teklehaymanot and Giday, 2007.  Alelign et al. , 2011) thereby contributing to the degradation of the forest ecosystem and the nearby Lake Tana (Amare et al. , 2012.  Amare et al. , 2017).  This, in turn, has led to reduced livelihood options, economic and habitat losses, threatened biodiversity, undermined the valuable services provided by biological diversity and increased the risk of climate change.  In order to reverse this trend, innovative approaches are required that integrate environmental conservation objectives and livelihood improvements for the local communities (Alelign et al. , 2011).  A more detailed understanding of the link between forests and local livelihoods enables the promotion of more sustainable management practices while maintaining acceptable levels of utilization (Shaanker et al. , 2004.  Lepetu and Oladele, 2009).  Hence, investigating the dependence of local communities on their forest resources is vital to devise appropriate forest management and conservation strategies.  There is no shortage of studies that investigate how socio-economic household characteristics and local institutions affect deforestation, forest degradation and conservation (e. g.
