Corporate takeovers have lon g been considered a governance mechanism that can help reduce management entrenchment and improve productive efficiency of management (e. g. , Grossman and Hart, 1980; Fama, 1980; Jensen and
Ruback, 1983; Scharfstein, 1988, Jensen, 1993). 1 Consequently, firms that have antitakeover provisions (henceforth ATPs) in
place are often considered to be relatively inefficient.  Consistent with the perceived inefficiency of ATPs, a stream of research
finds that high ATP firms have lower accounting performance, lower Tobin's Q, and lower reinvestment rates, relative to low
ATP firms (e. g. , Gompers, Ishii and Metrick, 2003; Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; Bebchuk and Cohen, 2005; Bebchuk,
Cohen and Ferrell, 2009; Cohen and Wang, 2013).  However, despite negative portrayals in much of the archival research and
popular opinion, ATPs remain prevalent among the S&P 500 companies, with about 60% of these firms having staggered
boards and poison pills in place.  These provisions are also common in the charters of initial public offerings (Daines, 2001;
Daines and Klausner, 2001).  If ATPs unambiguously lead to inefficiencies, the question arises as to why market forces have
not eliminated their use over time. 
In this paper we attempt to address this disconnect by exploring the potential role of ATPs in long-term value creation. 
We identify a set of firms focused on long-term growth (innovative firms) that are most likely to benefit from ATPs and use
an exogenous event to isolate the benefit. 2 We suggest that while the threat of corporate takeovers can curb managerial
inefficiencies, it can also create incentives for myopic behavior by managers.  Fear of takeover and the associated employment risk may cause managers to take actions that are focused on maximizing short-term price rather than long-term value. 
Jensen (2005) states that “when numbers are manipulated to tell the market what they want to hear … and when real
operating decisions that would maximize value are compromised to meet market expectations, real long-term value is being
destroyed. ”.  Stein (1988) argues that ATPs can help managers pursue long-term goals more effectively by insulating them
from short-term market pressures.  The reasoning is that capital market pressures, including the threat of takeovers and the
associated employment risk, can cause management to behave myopically, shun projects that may carry a higher risk of
early failures, and focus on maximizing short-term price (Holmstrom, 1989).  Manso (2011) proposes a similar argument for
managerial protection as a means of encouraging innovation.  Rather than taking a one-size-fits-all view of ATPs and estimating their average effect on all firms, we explore a setting where such provisions can be beneficial to investors. 3
We use a number of alternative designs to explore the effect of anti-takeover protection on innovative and non-innovative firms.  Our primary research design is to explore the effects of a state law change in Delaware that significantly
increased the takeover costs of firms incorporated there.  Bebchuk and Cohen (2005), Low (2009), and Atanassov (2013)
discuss how the implementation of state law change in Delaware in 1995 made it easier for firms to use certain takeover
defenses such as poison pills to block hostile takeovers.  We examine the effect of this exogenous event on a firm's Tobin's Q. 
Using a difference-in-difference approach, we examine the effect of the regime change on innovative firms incorporated in
Delaware and compare it to the effect on other firms.  We find that after the change in state law, Delaware-based innovative
firms enjoyed a significant improvement in their Tobin's Q compared to both Delaware-based non-innovative firms and
non-Delaware-based innovative firms. 
Given that the state law change was particularly relevant to firms with poison pills and staggered boards in place, we
explore whether its effect is stronger for firms with above-average protection.  Using data obtained from the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC), we partition the sample into protected and unprotected firms using three alternative
measures of takeover protection: presence or absence of poison pills (PPILL), presence or absence of staggered boards (SB)
and above/below median value of the entrenchment index (EINDEX) proposed by Bebchuk Name (2009).
