 1.  Introduction Explaining the main determinants and improving the forecast accuracy of crude oil market volatility are crucial to market investors and government decision makers.  However, forecasting oil volatility is an intractable task, as the crude oil market is quite complex and has various uncertain determinants, such as global oil supply and demand, OPEC spare capacity levels, ﬁnancial crises, and national elections.  Some studies have claimed that oil price change relies heavily on oil demand and supply, especially global demand (i. e. , Dées et al. , 2007.  Kilian, 2009.  Mu and Ye, 2011).  However, other studies have argued that a speculative component plays a key role (Zhang, 2013.  Hamilton and Wu, 2014.  Kilian and Murphy, 2014.  Juvenal and Petrella, 2015.  Gogolin and Kearney, 2016).  Liu et al.  (2016) disentangle the contributions of oil demand, supply, and speculation in real oil prices, whereas Yin and Zhou (2016) identify the role of speculation and economic fundamentals in driving oil price volatility.  However, as in the seminal work of Baker et al.  (2013) on measuring economic policy uncertainty (EPU), it is worth mentioning that many studies have examined the effect of EPU on the stock market and have considered EPU indices in forecasting stock market returns (Pastor and Veronesi, 2012.  Antonakakis et al. , 2013.  Kang and Ratti, 2013.  Tsai, 2017).  The literature about EPU's impact on the oil market is growing in recent years (e. g. , Aloui et al. , 2016.  Balcilar et al. , 2016.  Yin, 2016).  For example, Aloui et al.  (2016) hold that the movements in uncertainty index can identify the supply-side, aggregate-demand, and oil-speciﬁc demand shocks, that directly drive the oil price.  Thus, an increase (decrease) in the uncertainty index probably negatively (positively) affects the economy, which in turn reduces (increases) the demand and supply of crude oil and then cause oil price volatility.  Balcilar et al.  (2016) also emphasize that EPU can drive the oil price ﬂuctuations.  We conjecture that a high EPU can cause serious divergence in the expectations of oil consumers, producers, and speculators simultaneously and thus affect the demand, supply, or speculation stock for crude oil.  Therefore, EPU may comprehensively involves various information such as oil shocks, ﬁnancial crisis, and political events that greatly impact the oil market and cause oil price volatility.  However, it is not clear whether EPU is the most informative factor in forecasting oil volatility, and which determinant is the most powerful remains to be addressed.  This study is speciﬁcally related to the literature on the determinants of oil market return or volatility (e. g. , Dées et al. , 2007.  Kilian, 2009.  Mu and Ye, 2011.  Conrad et al. , 2014.  Hamilton and Wu, 2014.  Kilian and Murphy, 2014.  Gogolin and Kearney, 2016) and the predictability of EPU indices in asset return or volatility (e. g. , Pastor and Veronesi, 2012.  Antonakakis et al. , 2013.  Kang and Ratti, 2013.  Tsai, 2017).  We address two questions.  First, is EPU helpful for forecasting crude oil market volatility.  Second, which determinant is most informative and helpful in forecasting spot oil volatility—oil demand, supply, speculation, or the novel EPU index.  To answer these questions, we consider two newly released global EPU (GEPU) indices and six countryspeciﬁc EPU indices from major oil consumers and producers worldwide.  This allows us to investigate whether these new indices help in forecasting oil volatility and to compare their predictabilities with those of traditional determinants.  Regarding the models for forecasting asset volatility, GARCH and its extensions have been popularly used in empirical analyses (e. g. , Bollerslev, 1987.  Glosten et al. , 1993.  Cheong, 2009.  Mohammadi and Su, 2010.  Nomikos and Andriosopoulos, 2012.  Charles and Darné, 2014.  Eﬁmova and Serletis, 2014).  However, most of these models are strictly limited to imputing data at the same frequency.  Ghysels et al.  (2004) introduce mixed data sampling (MIDAS) regression models, which successfully address the data frequency problem.  To overcome the defect of GARCH-class models, Engle et al.  (2013) incorporate the MIDAS technique with the GARCH model, forming the GARCH-MIDAS model, which allows macroeconomic determinants to be incorporated at different sampling frequencies.  Conrad et al.  (2014) use the GARCH-MIDAS model to investigate the oil volatility with respect to the stance of the U. S.  macroeconomy but they focus on insample evidence.  Combination methods have also been argued to achieve stable forecast ability (Stock and Watson, 2004).  They can be categorized as constant combined models and time-varying combination methods.  Speciﬁcally, Raftery et al.  (2012) develop the dynamic model averaging (DMA) technique, which Liu et al.  (2017) successfully apply as a time-varying combination method to forecast volatilities of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil futures, accounting for both parameter and model uncertainty.  We construct 11 individual GARCHMIDAS models and three DMA model combinations with various determinants.  Although both Conrad et al.  (2014) and our study involve the determinants of oil price volatility.  However, our innovation is quite different from theirs in several ways.  First, based on the controversy in crude oil market, we aim to address the question which determinant is most informative and helpful in forecasting spot oil volatility, i. e. , oil demand, supply, speculation, or the novel EPU indices.  Whereas, the main contribution of Conrad et al.  (2014) provide the ﬁrst evidence on the link between U. S.  economic activity and the daily oil-stock correlation.  They examine whether the long-term oil and stock market volatility, as well as oil-stock correlation respond to the same macroeconomic information, especially, the oil-stock correlation.  Second, due to the different aims, Conrad et al.  (2014) consider the determinants that contain information on current and future U. S.  economic activity.  Unlike those determinants, we are the ﬁrst to integrate both the global economic policy uncertainty (GEPU) indices and several national economic policy uncertainty (EPU) indices with traditional determinants, such as global oil demand, supply, and speculation.  Third, unlike Conrad et al.  (2014), this study mainly concerns the models' out-of-sample performance.  We make two contributions.  First, we are the ﬁrst to consider various EPU indices, especially the GEPU indices and the country-speciﬁc EPU indices from major oil consumers and exporters, and the traditional determinants in forecasting crude oil market volatility.  Aloui et al.  (2016) suggest that EPU indices can identify three types of shock on oil prices (i. e. , supply-side, aggregate, and oil-speciﬁc demand).  Furthermore, we argue that EPU not only inﬂuences oil demand-supply fundamentals, but also changes market participants' sentiments, giving rise to speculation activities, and thus may contain more information and achieve better oil volatility forecasting accuracy than commonly used determinants.  Our empirical study provides an overview of the EPU indices and traditional determinants in forecasting oil volatility.  Second, we model daily oil volatility using a GARCH-MIDAS model with different monthly determinants.  To provide the time-varying effects of the determinants, we also apply DMA combination methods, allowing both a set of determinants and their coefﬁcients to change over time.  Furthermore, the models' forecasting performance is evaluated using the robust advanced model conﬁdence set (MCS) test (Hansen et al. , 2011).  We use monthly global oil demand, supply record, and speculation data and two GEPU indices and six country-speciﬁc EPU indices to model and forecast the daily volatility of WTI crude oil spot prices.  The main empirical results indicate that EPU indices contain more useful information than oil demand-supply fundamentals or speculation indices in determining the daily volatility of crude oil prices.  In particular, the GEPU index and the U. S. ’s EPU index produce more accurate volatility forecasts of WTI oil prices than other determinants.  Finally, no evidence is found that DMA combination methods are superior to individualThe rest of this paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 presents a brief literature review, which serves as a foundation for analyzing the determinants of oil volatility.  Section 3 describes the GARCH-MIDAS model and the DMA combination approach.  Section 4 discusses the data.  Section 5 presents the empirical results.  Section 6 concludes the2.  Literature review.  In this section, we revisit the literature on the subject.  Numerous studies have examined the determinants of oil price or returns.  The predominant explanation for oil price change is that oil price relies on oil demand and supply (Kilian, 2009.  Mu and Ye, 2011).  For example, Kilian (2009) distinguishes oil demand and supply shocks in oil price changes and claims that increases in oil price are mainly driven by demand.  Moreover, with the ﬁnancialization of crude oil, many papers have recognized the role of speculation and have examined its effect on oil prices (Kilian and Murphy, 2014.  Juvenal and Petrella, 2015.  Gogolin and Kearney, 2016).  Liu et al.  (2016) disentangle the oil demand, supply, and speculation of real oil prices.  Their results show that oil demand from the U. S.  and China plays a key role in oil price changes after 2000, whereas speculation contributes much less to oil price ﬂuctuations.  In particular, since Baker et al.  (2013) constructed the EPU index to measure EPU, many empirical studies have highlighted the importance of EPU indices in forecasting asset return and volatility (Pastor and Veronesi, 2012.  Antonakakis et al. , 2013, 2014.  Kang and Ratti, 2013.  Balcilar et al. , 2016.  Tsai, 2017).  There are growing literature on EPU's impact on the oil market, Antonakakis et al.  (2014) examine the relationship between EPU and oil prices and claim that EPU indices affect oil prices.  Bekiros et al.  (2015) claim that EPU matters in predicting oil price changes.  Recently, Aloui et al.  (2016) investigate the effect of uncertainty on crude oil returns.  Their results show that higher EPU indices signiﬁcantly increase crude oil returns only during certain periods.  Yin (2016) also illustrates the importance of policy uncertainty for both oil spot and futures returns.  Speciﬁcally, Aloui et al.  (2016) provide an accurate picture of the conditional dependence between oil and uncertainty.  They claim that increased uncertainty leads to increased oil prices, as oil suppliers can stock up due to a precautionary motive.  Thus, oil price ﬂuctuations can reﬂect either demand or supply shocks.  In addition, Balcilar et al.  (2016) emphasize the role of EPU as a driver of oil price ﬂuctuations.  These ﬁndings illustrate that EPU indices can be good determinants in forecasting the oil volatility.  GEPU indices are constructed and released monthly.  The GEPU index is a GDP-weighted average of national EPU indices, accounting for two thirds of the global GDP.  Currently, there are two versions of the GEPU index—that with nominal GDP weights and that with purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted GDP weights.  Few studies have applied the newly released GEPU index.  Speciﬁcally, oil is the main energy source of the modern world, and oil price uncertainty is crucial for all countries.  Furthermore, oil price ﬂuctuations are affected by the EPUs of many countries, especially the countries of main oil consumers and producers.  In this regard, the GEPU index is supposed to be a good determinant of oil price volatility.  EPU indices reﬂect not only demand-supply fundamentals and economic activity, but also investors' sentiments.  Thus, EPU indices, especially the GEPU index, are supposed to be synthetic determinants of oil price uncertainty.  Colombo (2013) ﬁnds that the EPU of the U. S.  drives the EPUs of major European countries, Canada, and China, implying that a shock to the U. S.  EPU affects worldwide uncertainty.  Thus, the U. S.  EPU may have a greater effect on the global oil market.  We include two global indices and six national EPU indices from major oil exporters and consumers worldwide.  This allows us to examine whether these new indices help forecast oil volatility and to compare the predictabilities of these determinants.  There are various theoretical approaches to modeling and forecasting oil market volatility.  Of the models based on low-frequency data, the majority of empirical investigations of oil volatility that use daily or monthly data have used GARCH-class models (Cheong, 2009.  Mohammadi and Su, 2010.  Nomikos and Andriosopoulos, 2012.  Charles and Darné, 2014.  Eﬁmova and Serletis, 2014).  Although GARCH-class models and their extensions are widely used, most are limited to data at the same frequency.  Interestingly, Ghysels et al.  (2004) introduce MIDAS regression models.  MIDAS regression successfully addresses the problem of the explained and explanatory variables being sampled at different frequencies, such as daily, weekly, and monthly.  Ghysels et al.  (2006) construct MIDAS-AR and consider various MIDAS regressions to predict equity volatility.  In the MIDAS framework, Ghysels et al.  (2007) propose some extensions, such as nonlinear MIDAS and multi-variable MIDAS.  Engle et al.  (2013) construct the GARCH-MIDAS model by incorporating MIDAS with the commonly used GARCH model.  The GARCH-MIDAS model has several advantages.  For instance, it distinguishes long- and short-term volatility.  It also differentiates low-frequency volatility and macro fundamentals as longterm volatility, and provides a ﬂexible methodology.  Thus, it has been applied in many recent forecasting practices (e. g. , Engle et al. , 2013.  Asgharian et al. , 2013.  Conrad et al. , 2014).  For example, Engle et al.  (2013) use the GARCH-MIDAS model to measure the contribution of macroeconomic variables to forecasting stock market volatility.  Asgharian et al.  (2013) apply the GARCH-MIDAS model to examine whether macroeconomic variables can help forecast stock return variance.  These empirical studies support that the GARCH-MIDAS model signiﬁcantly improves forecasting accuracy and outperforms the traditional GARCH model.  Especially, using the GARCH-MIDAS framework, Conrad et al.  (2014) analyze whether the long-term oil volatility is related to the U. S.  macroeconomy determinants such as industrial production (IP), national activity index (NAI), and so on.  In light of this, we consider different monthly determinants and incorporate them into GARCH-MIDAS to model and forecast daily spot oil volatility.  Although many individual models, such as GARCH and GARCHMIDAS, have been applied in the economics and ﬁnance ﬁelds, Stock and Watson (2004) point out that the predictabilities of individual models are very unstable and change over time.  Hence, some studies have discussed how to combine a set of forecasts to produce superior composite forecasts (Liu and Maheu, 2008.  Santos and Ziegelmann,In particular, Raftery et al.  (2010) propose the DMA method, which allows the model to vary with variables over time.  The important feature of the DMA method is that it allows for both time-varying coefﬁcients and a large state space model (i. e. , the set of oil volatility determinants can change over time).  Consequently, DMA has been widely used in forecasting in recent years (e. g. , Koop and Korobilis, 2012.  Naser, 2016.  Wang et al. , 2016).  Liu et al.  (2017) apply the DMA method as a time-varying combination method.  The DMA method dynamically combines the generated models by using two forgetting factors to estimate both model parameters and model switching probabilities (i. e. , DMA successfully avoids arbitrary choices made by model users).  However, there is no consensus on whether combination methods are superior to individual models due to the large estimation errors in the DMA method.  Therefore, we include three DMA model combinations and compare them to 11 individual GARCH-MIDAS models.  To compare the models' performance, various loss functions are used.  However, the loss functions cannot indicate which models are signiﬁcantly better than others.  Hansen (2005) solves this problem by proposing a superior predictive ability test.  Hansen et al.  (2011) propose a more robust test known as the MCS test.  The MCS test does not need to specify an obvious benchmark, which is very useful in applications and thus is popularly used to compare forecasting models.  Nevertheless, the research has not yet considered EPU indices in forecasting oil price volatility, especially the newly constructed GEPU indices.  No study has investigated the effects of oil demand-supply fundamentals or speculation with global and national EPU indices.  Moreover, few studies have analyzed which determinants are the main causes of oil volatility.  We ﬁll these gaps by using both individual GARCH-MIDAS models and the time-varying DMA combination method under the evaluation framework of the MCS test.  <Middle> Empirical methodology.  3. 1.  GARCH-MIDAS model.  To investigate the contribution of different monthly determinants (i. e. , oil demand, supply, speculation, and EPU) on daily oil price volatility, we use a new GARCH-class model introduced by Engle and Rangel (2008) and Engle et al.  (2013).  The GARCH-MIDAS model is based on the MIDAS regression proposed by Ghysels et al.  (2006).  The main advantage of the GARCH-MIDAS model is that it allows for the incorporation of macroeconomic fundamentals at lower frequencies to forecast daily asset volatility.  We illustrate the GARCH-MIDAS model as follows.  Suppose that an unexpected return is expressed as follows, where ri, t is the log return of WTI oil price on day i in month t and Ei−1,t(ri,t) is the conditional mean of oil returns given the information set Φi−1,t up to day i-1.  Following Sadorsky (2006) and Narayan and Narayan (2007), we set Ei−1,t(ri,t)=μ, as a daily oil return has a very small mean and its dynamics are dominated by variance.  The conditional variance of the daily oil return is divided into two components.  a shortterm component deﬁned as gi,t and a long-term component deﬁned as τt.  The short-term volatility component, gi,t, is assumed to be a simple GARCH (1,1) process deﬁned as follows.  The long-term component, τt, is expressed as follows, where m is an intercept and θ is the slope of the weighted effects of lagged low-frequency fundamentals Vt on the long-term volatility of the oil return.  Furthermore, Vt is the growth rates of EPUs, oil demand, supply, and speculation, which can take negative values.  Thus, as Engle et al.  (2013) note, Eq.  (4) is usually presented in logarithmic form, where the optimal lag orders of K can be decided by the minimum Bayesian information criterion (BIC).  As suggested by Ghysels et al.  (2006) and Engle et al.  (2013), the weighting scheme usually adopted in Eq.  (4) is described by one- or two-parameter Beta polynomials.  3. 2.  Forecasting combination.  dynamic model averaging approach.  Studies have shown that constant coefﬁcient models have some problems.  For example, the predictors' effects on the predicted variables change over time (Ghysels et al. , 2013.  Drachal, 2016.  Naser, 2016).  Hence, a speciﬁc model with a ﬁxed set of predictors may not consistently perform well (Stock and Watson, 2004).  To overcome this drawback, time-varying parameter (TVP) models, which allow the parameters of explanatory variables to change over time, have emerged.  In particular, Raftery et al.  (2010) propose the DMA approach, which allows both sets of predictors and their coefﬁcients to change over time.  Consequently, the DMA approach has been popularly applied in macroeconomic forecasting due to its ﬂexibility (e. g. , Koop and Korobilis, 2011, 2012.  Naser, 2016.  Wang et al. , 2016).  Following Primiceri (2005) and Koop et al.  (2009), the ordinary TVP model can be described as follows, where yt is the dependent variable, xt-1 is a 1 × m vector of predictors, βt is an m × 1 vector of coefﬁcients, and the innovation items are distributed as εt~i.  i.  d.  N(0,Vt) and ηt~i.  i.  d.  N(0,Wt).  This model can be estimated using the Kalman ﬁlter method.  In the models deﬁned by Eqs.  (8) and (9), it is assumed that the predictors in xt-1 are ﬁxed throughout the sample period, which may lead to over-parameterization problems and lower forecast accuracy.  Nevertheless, DMA is superior to the TVP model, as it allows both sets of predictors (forecasting models in a combination method) and their coefﬁcients to change over time.  The DMA approach can be illustrated as follow, where xt−1 and εt~i.  i.  d.  N(0,Vt (k)).  If there are m predictors in xt−1′, the total number of possible combinations of these predictors is K = 2m.  Then, DMA can dynamically incorporate the uncertainty factors from the K models,  where the probability of Model K is π(t| t − 1, k)= Pr(Lt =k| Yt −1).  The equation Lt = K indicates that Model K is selected at time t and that Yt−1={y1,…,yt−1}.  DMA obtains its forecast by taking the average of all the K models in terms of their historical forecasting performance, denoted by π(t|t−1,k).  However, the DMA approach has a computational burden.  Without loss of forecast accuracy, Raftery et al.  (2010) simplify the DMA estimation using the Kalman ﬁlter method.  The initial assumptions are that is independent and identically distributed, and that βt−1  can be  determined separately only if Lt−1=k.  In this set of assumptions, λ is recommended as a forgetting factor, which plays an important role in the calculation of βt−1 (k) , where observations j periods in the past gain λj weight from the starting period.  λ can also be used to simplify the covariance matrix of βt−1 (k) .  This process is expressed as follows.  denotes the covariance matrix of βt−1 where Σt∣t−1 timation is then calculated using the following updating equations.  Another forgetting factor, α, is used in Eq.  (12).  If we use a transition matrix of probability, we should consider K=2m model combinations with m predictors at each point.  Once m exceeds 5, it is impracticable to operate the Markov switching in the K × K matrix.  Thus, using forgetting factor α can greatly reduce the calculation time and error.  Based on the forgetting factor, probability in the forecasting model is determined as follows.  The updating equation is deﬁned as follows, where fℓ(yt| Yt − 1) denotes the predictive density of Model ℓ.  Eqs.  (13)–(18) consist of all of the steps of the Kalman ﬁlter prediction and the updating process.  We apply the DMA approach as a time-varying combination method.  Instead of directly imputing the determinants in xt−1′, we use the forecasts from individual models as predictors.  Thus, the DMA approach can dynamically combine the models and be applied as a time-varying combination method.  3. 3.  Model evaluation.  model conﬁdence set test.  To evaluate the performance of the GARCH-MIDAS models with different sets of low-frequency determinants, we use two popular loss functions and the MCS test as our evaluation criteria.  These loss functions are the mean squared forecast error (MSFE) and the mean absolute forecast error (MAFE), which are deﬁned as follows, where yt is the true daily oil volatility represented by the squared daily returns on day t, whereas ^yt is the set of forecasts obtained from different models and M is the number of forecasts.  As the loss functions cannot distinguish whether the loss differences of these models are statistically signiﬁcant, we use an advanced test.  the MCS test of Hansen et al.  (2011).  The MCS test has several advantages over conventional tests (e. g. , Diebold and Mariano, 1995.  West, 1996.  White, 2000.  Hansen and Lunde, 2005).  For example, it does not have to specify a benchmark model, which is very useful in applications.  Moreover, it allows for the possibility of more than one “best” model.  The MCS test process is as follows.  Consider a set, M0, which contains a ﬁnite number of models, indexed by m = 1, …, m0.  These objects are evaluated over the sample t = 1, …, n in terms of loss function i.  We denote the loss associated with model u in period t as Lu,t.  The relative performance variables are deﬁned as duv,t ≡ Lu,t – Lv,t for all u, v∈M0.  The set of superior models is then deﬁned as follows, where E(di,uv,t) is the mathematical expectation of duv,t under the specific loss function i, such as MSFE or MAFE.  The MCS test is conducted through a sequence of signiﬁcance tests in which the models that prove to be signiﬁcantly inferior to other elements of M0 are eliminated.  The null hypotheses that are being tested take the following form.  The MCS procedure is based on an equivalence test, δM, and an elimination rule, eM.  The equivalence test, δM, is used to test hypothesis H0 for any M ⊂ M0 and the elimination rule, eM, identiﬁes the model of M that is to be removed from M on the condition that H0 is rejected.  After repeatingthese two tests, we obtain set ^M 1−α, which consists of the set of “surviving” models.  The larger the p-value of the MCS test, the higher the forecast accuracy of the corresponding model.  Speciﬁcally, the signiﬁcance level α is usually set to be no more than 0. 25 (e. g. , Wei et al. , 2010.  Hansen et al. , 2011.  Tian and Hamori (2015).  Wang et al. , 2016.  Liu et al. , 2017.  Pu et al. , 2016).  However, the main purpose of this paper is to determine the most informative factor(s) controlling the long-term volatility of crude oil price instead of judging all the signiﬁcant inﬂuential factors.  Hence we set a higher signiﬁcance level α of 0. 5 in the empirical examination of this paper to guarantee that the “surviving” models are extraordinarily well performed.  In addition, Hansen et al.  (2011) suggest using the range statistic (TR) and the semi-quadratic statistic (TSQ) for model evaluation.  These statistics are deﬁned as follows, where di. uv ¼ 1 t¼1 di. uv. t.  If the p-values of TR and TSQ are larger than 0. 1, we conclude that the null hypothesis (Eq.  (22)) cannot be rejected.  The asymptotic distributions of the statistics TR and TSQ are nonstandard, as they depend on nuisance parameters (under both the null and alternative conditions).  However, these conditions pose no obstacle, as the distributions of these statistics are easily estimated using bootstrap methods that implicitly solve the nuisance parameter problem.  In addition to TR and TSQ, we use four more statistics (i. e. , Tmax, TQ, TF and TD) to reach more robust conclusions (Hansen et al. , 2011).  4.  Data.  The data sample used in this study includes two parts.  one is the daily WTI crude oil spot prices and the other is the monthly macrolevel determinants of oil price volatility.  The monthly dataset consists of the global oil demand index, the oil supply record, the oil speculation index, two GEPU indices, and six country-speciﬁc EPU indices.  The global oil demand index is a measure of real global economic activity, constructed from the dry cargo shipping rate index developed by Kilian and Park (2009).  This real activity index is a business cycle index and a stationary construct that is designed to capture shifts in the global use of industrial commodities.  The global oil supply record is represented by global crude oil production, which is available in the Monthly Energy Review of the Energy Information Administration (EIA).  Following the methods of Hamilton (2009) and Kilian and Murphy (2014), we use the ratio of OECD petroleum stocks over U. S.  petroleum stocks recorded by the EIA to represent oil speculation.  The two GEPU indices are GDP-weighted averages of national EPU indices for 18 countries.  Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the U. K. , and the U. S.  There are two versions of the GEPU indices.  one is based on current-price GDP measures (denoted as EPU_global_GDP) and the other is based on PPP-adjusted GDP (denoted as EPU_global_PPP). 1 The six country-speciﬁc EPU indices are collected from three major oil-demand countries (i. e. , the U. S. , China, and Japan) and three major oil-supply countries (Russia, Canada, and the U. K. ).  Although the daily US EPU index is available, we employ monthly EPU indices to keep consistent with the frequency of other determinants for further comparison.  The data cover the period from January 1997 to April 2016. 2 All of the data are transformed to logarithm growth rates (except for the global oil demand index) and divided by 100, as constructed by Kilian and Park (2009).  For clarity, Fig.  1 presents the evolutions of WTI oil returns and the growth rates of GEPU weighted on current-price GDP and of the global oil demand index.  Fig.  1 indicates that the WTI oil returns present clear volatility clustering throughout the whole data sample, especially during ﬁve market crisis periods.  the 1997–1998 Southeast Asian ﬁnancial crisis, the 2000– 2001 dotcom bubble burst, the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, the 2010–2011 European debt crisis outbreak, and the stock market crash in China from June 2015 to January 2016.  It is clear that the GEPU and oil demand indices ﬂuctuate violently during these ﬁve crisis stages.  However, global oil demand reacted to these crises differently.  it increased sharply during the subprime mortgage crisis and the European debt crisis, but decreased rapidly during Southeast Asia's ﬁnancial crisis, the dotcom bubble burst, and China's stock market crash, implying that oil demand is mainly affected by real economic activities instead of ﬁnancial market turmoil.  The summary statistics of all of the daily and monthly time series are listed in Table 1.  First, Table 1 shows that the sample mean of the WTI oil return is quite small compared with its standard deviation, implying that we may simply use a constant to model the conditional mean of daily oil returns when investigating the volatility of crude oil prices (see Sadorsky, 2006.  Narayan and Narayan, 2007.  Kang et al. , 2009.  Wei et al. , 2010).  Second, of the two GEPU indices and six country-speciﬁc EPU indices, Russia and the U. S. ’s EPUs have the largest and smallest standard deviations, respectively, indicating that the EPU in Russia changes more frequently and violently than in other countries, whereas the EPU in the U. S.  is more stable than in other countries.  Third, the standard deviation of the global oil demand index is much larger than those of oil supply and speculation, implying that oil demand ﬂuctuates more heavily than oil supply and speculation.  Lastly, the augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test supports the rejection of the null hypothesis of a unit root signiﬁcantly, implying that all of the time series are stationary and thus can be modeled directly withouttransformations.  5.  Empirical results.  5. 1.  In-sample estimation results.  The in-sample estimation results of the GARCH-MIDAS models for all of the determinants of oil volatility are listed in Table 2.  As discussed in Section 3. 1, two kinds of Beta polynomial weight functions may be used in the GARCH-MIDAS model estimations (see Eqs.  (6) and (7)).  We ﬁnd that in most cases, the two parameters, ω1 and ω2, are not signiﬁcantly different from 0 if the weight function in Eq.  (7) is adopted (see Asgharian et al. , 2013.  Engle et al. , 2013).  Thus, the oneparameter weight function in Eq.  (6) is used.  The lag orders of monthly determinants in the GARCH-MIDAS models are chosen by the minimum BIC.  Table 2 shows that almost all of the estimated parameters are significant except for several ω coefﬁcients in the weight function.  All of the β parameters are close to 1 and signiﬁcant at the 1% level, indicating a high degree of volatility persistence in the WTI oil prices.  We are interested in the value of parameter θ in Eq.  (5), which indicates the effect of monthly determinants of the long-term volatility of WTI oil prices.  The estimation results for parameter θ in Panel A of Table 2 reveal that both the two GEPU indices and six country-speciﬁc EPU indices have signiﬁcant positive effects on the long-term volatility of oil prices.  This implies that a high EPU causes serious divergence in the expectations of oil consumers, producers, and speculators simultaneously and thus affects the demand, supply, or speculation stock for crude oil.  Speciﬁcally, GEPU weighted by current-price GDP, with a θ value of 3. 045, has the largest average effect on the long-term volatility of oil prices of all of the EPU indices.  In addition, EPUs from the U. S.  and Japan make relatively important contributions to oil volatility, whereas EPUs in the U. K. , Russia, and China are less informative in determining oil volatility.  The estimation results for parameter θ in Panel B of Table 2 indicate that oil production seems to have a larger effect on long-term oil volatility than oil demand or speculation.  Fig.  2 shows the estimated total daily volatility and long-term (secular) volatility of the six GARCH-MIDAS models.  The green dashed line indicates the total daily volatility and the blue line indicates the secular volatility determined by different macro-level variables.  The upper and lower panels of Fig.  2 show the estimated results of different EPUs and oil demand, supply, and speculation indices, respectively.  It is clear that all six subﬁgures of Fig.  2 produce similar daily volatility estimates, although quite different secular volatilities are indicated by different monthly macro-level variables.  Fig.  2 suggests that different EPU indices, oil demand-supply fundamentals, and speculation contribute to long-term oil volatility in different ways.  However, we focus on detecting which determinant is most helpful in forecasting the daily volatility of WTI oil prices.  Thus, in the next step, we use the MCS test to quantitatively compare the performance of these GARCH-MIDAS models to different monthly EPU, oil demand, supply, and speculation indices.  5. 2.  Out-of-sample forecasting performance.  To obtain robust model evaluation results, Tables 3-5 report the MCS testing results of three out-of-sample forecasting horizons (i. e. , the last 250 days, 500 days, and 750 days of the total sample), ranging from approximately 1 to 3 years.  We use the rolling window method in our forecasting procedure.  All of the data from January 1997 to April 2016 are classiﬁed into two subgroups.  the in-sample data for volatility modeling and the out-of-sample data for model evaluation.  The estimation period is then rolled forward by adding one new day and dropping the most distant day.  This way, the sample size used to estimate the models remains ﬁxed and the forecasts do not overlap.  We re-estimate the parameters of these models to get the 1-dayahead volatility forecasts.  As discussed in Section 3. 3, the larger the p-value of the MCS test, the better forecasting accuracy the corresponding model achieves.  However, there is no consensus on setting the threshold p-value alpha in MCS tests.  Regarding volatility predictions in literature, the MCS alpha has been set as different values.  For example, Tian and Hamori (2015) set the p-value alpha to be 0. 1.  Whereas Pu et al.  (2016) set the p-value alpha to be 0. 25.  In this paper, Tables 3-5 report the p-values of the MCS tests for GARCH-MIDAS models with different monthly determinants.  We can ﬁnd that there are many p-values larger than 0. 25, suggesting that the determinants are signiﬁcant.  To clearly distinguish the most informative factor(s) controlling the long-term volatility of crude oil price, we set the threshold p-value to be 0. 5 in Tables 3-5.  The numbers larger than 0. 5 are indicated in bold and underlined, indicating that the corresponding models perform signiﬁcantly the best. Furthermore, a p-value of 1. 000 indicates a model that performs the best out of all of the models.  Tables 3-5 indicate that the EPU contains more useful information than oil demand, production, or speculation in determining future crude oil price volatility.  First, Table 3 indicates the results of the 250-day out-of-sample forecasting evaluation, where Panels A and B report the testing results for 11 individual models and 3 DMA model combinations, respectively.  With regard to the MSFE criterion, only the individual model with GEPU weighted as the current-price GDP, denoted as EPU_Global_GDP, can survive the MCS test with p-values equal to 1. 000 for all six test statistics.  Furthermore, no DMA model combinations survive under the MSFE loss function.  As far as the MAFE criterion is concerned, only the two individual models with EPU_Global_GDP and global oil production pass the MCS test under all six test statistics.  Unfortunately, the DMA model combinations usually prove to be superior to individual models in forecasting oil prices (see Naser, 2016), but the three model combinations used in this study (i. e. , combinations of all EPUs, oil fundamentals with speculation, and all determinants) survive only under the MAFE criterion with TR and TD test statistics.  Second, Table 4 shows the 500-day MCS testing results for different GARCH-MIDAS models.  When the MSFE criterion is considered, of the fourteen competitors, the models with EPU_Global_GDP and U. S.  EPU are the only two that pass the MCS test with all six test statistics.  Similar to the results in Table 3, almost no model combinations survive the MCS test.  With regard to the MAFE criterion, the testing results seem to be a little more optimistic.  In addition to the two individual models with EPU_Global_GDP and the U. S.  EPU, the individual model with global oil production (oil supply) also survives.  Furthermore, the DMA model combination with all EPUs (DMA_EPU) and the combination with oil demand, supply, and speculation (DMA_Fund_Spe) provide satisfactory volatility forecasting accuracy under all six test statistics.  Finally, Table 5 presents the MCS testing results over a longer period (i. e. , 750 days).  We ﬁnd that only the individual GARCH-MIDAS model with the U. S. ’s EPU survives under all of the error criteria and test statistics.  The three DMA model combinations again lose forecasting accuracy as revealed in Table 3.  In conclusion, Tables 3-5 indicate that EPU contains more useful information than oil demand, production, or speculation in determining the future volatility of crude oil prices.  This ﬁnding may reveal that EPU can simultaneously change the expectations of oil demanders, producers, and speculators and thus synthetically affect the volatility of crude oil prices.  Furthermore, of the different kinds of EPU, GEPU weighted as current-price GDP and the U. S. ’s EPU indices are the most powerful determinants predicting crude oil market volatility.  It is also worth mentioning that Yuan et al.  (2008) prove that economic growth in China has a strong inﬂuence on crude oil prices.  Liu et al.  (2016) also reveal that Chinese and U. S.  demand shocks explain approximately 70% of the variations in oil prices over longer periods, but Chinese demand shocks to oil price variations are greater than U. S.  demand shocks.  Tsai (2017) also ﬁnds that the EPU in China is the most inﬂuential contributor to the stock returns of 22 stock markets worldwide, and that the effect of the EPU in the U. S.  is inferior to that in China.  However, no evidence shows that China's EPU has greater explanatory power on the volatility of the crude oil market than those of the U. S.  or other countries.  China is the second largest economy and also the second largest crude oil consumer in the world.  Therefore, the real economic activities in China have strong direct effects on oil prices.  Over the past decades, China's top priority has been to maintain stable and rapid economic growth.  it uses all of the possible ﬁscal and monetary policies to achieve this goal.  Thus, the proactive ﬁscal policy, prudent monetary policy, and political stability in China in recent years are less likely to cause high crude oil price volatility.  In addition, we ﬁnd that GEPU weighted as current-price GDP is more effective than the PPP-adjusted version in forecasting oil volatility.  This implies that the crude oil market is more sensitive to nominal economic indicators than to real ones.  Lastly, the comparison between model combinations and individual models shows that the combination forecasting method generally cannot achieve stable forecasting accuracy and is inferior to individual models in most cases.  Drachal (2016) observes a similar result, in which the DMA method performs inferiorly to the ARIMA model in forecasting WTI spot oil prices.  Our ﬁndings have important economic implications.  For example, in addition to traditional demand-supply fundamentals and speculation behavior, policymakers, oil market participants, and investors should pay more attention to the changes in worldwide EPU indices, especially the GEPU and the U. S. ’s EPU indices, when making market regulation, oil production, purchasing, stock, or investment decisions.  Although economic growth in China has proved to strongly affect crude oil prices, we ﬁnd that China's economic uncertainty has less inﬂuence on the short-term and long-term volatility of oil prices than that of other countries, implying that real economic activities, rather than economic uncertainty, in China should be watched closely when analyzing oil price trends.  Similarly, although Russia is characterized as having high economic uncertainty and being a major oil-export country, it has less inﬂuence on oil price volatility, indicating that its economic uncertainty should not be assigned a large weight in analyzing crude oil market volatility.  Lastly, speculation is also found to have little inﬂuence on oil market volatility, which may imply that no strict restrictions on speculation trading are necessary if policymakers aim to stabilize oil prices.  <Conclusion> Conclusions.  Crude oil market volatility has an important inﬂuence on policymakers' decisions and investors' ﬁnancial strategies, whereas many macro-level determinants are found to have great effects on oil volatility.  Of the various determinants, global oil demand, supply, and speculation have traditionally been considered the most powerful.  We explore EPU indices, especially the newly released GEPU indices, and traditional indicators in forecasting oil volatility.  We use both the GARCH-MIDAS model and the DMA combination method with these determinants.  We investigate which determinant helps to make the most accurate daily volatility forecasts across three different forecasting horizons.  First, our ﬁndings show that EPU indices are comprehensive determinants, which may synthetically reﬂect the effects of oil demand, supply, and speculation on crude oil volatility.  Second, GEPU weighted as current-price GDP and the U. S. ’s EPU indices have more predicting power in forecasting the daily volatility of WTI oil prices than those of other country-speciﬁc EPU indices, oil demand-supply fundamentals, and speculation.  Finally, in most cases, combination models do not surpass individual GARCH-MIDAS models in daily volatility forecasting.  This study has clear limitations.
