 Introduction Stock liquidity is central to the efficient functioning of trade in the financial markets and is determined in part by information asymmetry among traders.  Since voluntary disclosure can affect information asymmetry among traders, theoretical research has shown that voluntary disclosure can affect stock liquidity (e. g. , Bushman and Indjejikian, 1995).  However, empirical tests of this mechanism must recognize that a manager's provision of disclosure is a product of many forces, all of which must be identified. 1 It has proved difficult to construct an empirical model of disclosure that incorporates all these forces (e. g. , Joos, 2000.  Leuz and Verrecchia, 2000).  Index funds, by contrast, trade primarily for nonstrategic reasons, and theory suggests that such nonstrategic traders unambiguously prefer higher disclosure relative to privately informed managers and strategic investors.  This implies that I can use index funds' disclosure preferences to construct an empirical model of voluntary disclosure that abstracts away from managers' strategic disclosure motives.  Accordingly, I use an index-fund setting to construct a recursive model of voluntary disclosure, index fund ownership, and stock liquidity, and demonstrate that voluntary disclosure increases stock liquidity.  The effect of index fund ownership on liquidity can arise from two mechanisms.  (1) index funds' unambiguous preference for additional disclosure, and (2) index fund ownership itself (e. g. , increased nonstrategic trading related to portfolio rebalancing).  Separating these two mechanisms is crucial for understanding the determinants of liquidity, but it cannot be done with simple OLS or regression discontinuity (RD) techniques.  For example, even if index funds elicit more disclosure from managers, instrumenting disclosure with index fund ownership does not solve the identification problem.
