 1.  Introduction There is an ongoing debate about the role of oil and gold in hedging equity portfolios, which has become topical since the ﬁnancial crisis and the subsequent ﬂuctuations in the prices of these assets.  In the literature, the role of oil and gold as hedges is not universally accepted, and it seems to depend on geopolitical, economic, as well as other idiosyncratic factors.  This topic is of particular interest for oil-exporting countries, which are usually rich in these assets.  However, most of the literature has focused on developed countries (Baur and McDermott, 2010.  Hood and Malik, 2013.  Choi and Hammoudeh, 2010.  Creti et al. , 2013.  Ciner et al. , 2013), while developing countries have only recently started receiving further attention (Basher and Sadorsky, 2016).  Using data from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries1 from January 2004 to May 2016, this paper employs a dynamic conditional correlation model (DCC-GARCH) to ﬁrst examine the shock transmissions between the equity markets and the two commodities, and then evaluate the hedging opportunities arising from including crude oil and gold in equity portfolios.  Our paper is the ﬁrst to consider the dynamic relationships between oil, gold and equities in the GCC countries, therefore further contributing to the debate.
