Aquaculture is a rapidly growing industry that has become a major
supplier of ﬁsh and shellﬁsh to the global market (FAO, 2014).  Concern
about the environmental effects of aquaculture is also growing.  The production of shrimp and salmon, two of the most lucrative and widely
traded aquaculture products, is responsible for a range of environmental
impacts due to the off-site effects of disease transmission, waste discharge, escapees, the use of chemicals and drugs, and the consumption
of ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil (Naylor Name, 1998).  The most important of the
environmental externalities of salmon farming is the transmission of
sea lice to wild ﬁsh stocks (Asche Name, 2009.  Taranger Name, 2015. 
Lafferty Name, 2015). 
In this paper we focus on a particular disease externality of coastal
salmon farms— the effect of sea lice on wild ﬁsh stocks.  This effect has
been debated extensively.  Researchers agree that sea lice are one of
many factors that affect wild stock levels.  However, there is disagreement about the size of the effect.  Some argue that lice are not instrumental in wild stock population decline (Marty Name, 2010).  Others
claim that where salmon net-pens provide ideal conditions for sea
lice, they are the primary threat to vulnerable migrating wild juveniles
(Krkošek Name, 2006, 2007).  In both Norway and Canada, sea lice are argued to be a major threat to the sustainability of marine aquaculture and
the viability of wild ﬁsheries, and are subject to strict regulations. 
The generic problem in the management of wildlife disease externalities of aquaculture is the regulation of transmission risks due to contact between infected farmed stocks and susceptible wild stocks
(Conrad and Rondeau, 2015.  Fischer Name, 2015, 2016).
