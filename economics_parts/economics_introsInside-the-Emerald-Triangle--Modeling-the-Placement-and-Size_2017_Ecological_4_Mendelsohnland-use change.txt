Land-use conversions from forested and natural lands to agricultural
landscapes are a leading cause of biodiversity decline worldwide
(Gibson Name, 2011.  Laurance Name, 2014).  Agricultural conversions
also release large amounts of carbon and contribute signiÔ¨Åcantly to climate change (Mendelsohn and Dinar, 2009).  Economic models of agricultural land-use change have proved helpful in understanding the
ecological consequences of land conversion across multiple scales and
for many commodities (Lubowski Name, 2008).  These models can also
be used to predict the environmental impact of changes in agricultural
policy or prices (Lawler Name, 2014.
