 1.  Introduction Energy supply and production disruptions can have severe consequences in the entire economy.  For example, the natural gas supply disruptions experienced by Argentina in 2004 led to power generation shortages for the industrial and residential demands, leading to signiﬁcant impacts the national economy (Honoré, 2004).  The Northeast power outage of 2003 in the U. S.  affected more than 55 million people and resulted in estimated $10 billion economic losses (Liscouski and Elliot, 2004).  The topic of energy resilience (e. g. , FLYNN, 2012) has received much attention in the recent decades in the study of energy security (e. g. , IEA, 2014.  Vivoda, 2010.  Lefèvre, 2010.  Scheepers et al. , 2007.  Ang et al. , 2015).  The Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD, 2013) deﬁnes resilience as “the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions.  resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover from deliberate attacks, accidents, or naturally occurring threats or incidents”.  Molyneaux et al.  (2012) states that “resilience is the ability to absorb shocks and still retain function”.  Haimes (2009) deﬁned resilience as the “ability of system to withstand a major disruption within acceptable degradation parameters and to recover with a suitable time and reasonable costs and risks”.  Hence, the ability of an economy to recover its essential function of energy supply and production is of fundamental interest in the study of energy resilience.  Despite various attempts to characterize or deﬁne energy resilience, its quantiﬁcation is not straightforward.  Many aforementioned efforts proceed by evaluating performance and contributions from various infrastructural, economic and geographical perspectives, and then aggregating them into a form of composite indicator, for the purpose of comparison and ranking of energy resilience and security (e. g. , see Vivoda, 2010.  Molyneaux et al. , 2012.  Kruyt et al. , 2009).  However, a common critique of such approaches is that there can be signiﬁcant inﬂuence of subjective judgement, e. g.  in determining the relative importances of aggregating various performance indicators.  More importantly, energy-economic systems are generally highly inter-connected, and hence many economic sectors can simultaneously suffer the consequences of energy disruptions (e. g.  in the form of production losses).  Furthermore, the sectoral interdependencies can result in an unforeseen cascade of consequences, due to a seemingly isolated disruption event.  In a similar manner, post-disruption energy-economic recovery is highly dependent on the inter-sectoral connectivities.  Finally, energy resilience can also depend on the speciﬁc energy sectors disrupted, and often, there is limited a priori information or data to suggest which energy sectors are the most vulnerable targets of attack.  Motivated by the above issues, in this paper we propose an Input-Output linear programming model to study the relationships between energy production disruptions, impacts on sectoral production and demands, and post-disruption recovery efforts.  Despite some of their limitations, Input-Output models continue to be widely-adopted and useful formats to depict inter-sectoral dependencies in the economy and energy emission studies (Su and Ang, 2012.  Su and Ang, 2015.  Hoekstra, 2010.  Hawkins et al. , 2015).  Many countries and states have continued to collect, publish and update data for calibrating Input-Output tables (e. g. , 43 countries’ time series IO data in World Input-Output Database Timmer et al. , 2016).  Our proposed methodology uses the economic Input-Output structure, in the format of a linear programming model, to evaluate the impact of a given energy sector’s output disruption on all other sectors’ total outputs and ability to fulﬁl ﬁnal goods demands.  Since energy production disruptions can arise from different sectors (possibly simultaneously) and cannot be anticipated precisely in advance, our proposed model evaluates the maximum impact on the economy, in the form of ﬁnal demand deﬁcits, over a set of (possibly inﬁnite) production disruption scenarios.  Our model also includes production recovery assumptions, so that after the energy disruption event, production is allowed to gradually recover, the rate of which depends on the level of recovery investments assumed.  Finally, the above components are combined to deﬁne the energyeconomic resilience of the system under study, which is essentially related to the minimum level of extrinsic resource recovery investments required to restore the production levels suﬃciently, such that the total economic impacts do not exceed a stipulated level over a stipulated post-disruption duration.  This provides decisionmakers with a simple way to evaluate, compare and rank the energy resilience of a given (set of) Input-Output system(s) under various scenario assumptions.  Moreover, our methodology can be used to identify the most vulnerable sectors at different levels of disruptions.  The main contributions of this work are as follows.  (a) A novelty in our proposed approach is the use of the level of required recovery efforts as a measure of energy resilience such that it only requires speciﬁcations such as the impact level of disruption, the level of acceptable demand deﬁcits and the post-disruption duration which are much more concrete and easier to elicit from stakeholders.  Besides, by using minimum required recovery efforts as the surrogate for the energy resilience, our methodology bypasses several diﬃculties in modelling energy resilience since in reality, data relating restoration investments to production recovery speeds are difﬁcult to obtain and calibrate.  (b) Our model correctly captures the physical realities of supply and demand balances during a disruption and can evaluate the maximum impact arising from an arbitrarily large set of disruption scenarios without applying single-scenarioa-time analysis nor relying on Monte Carlo methods compared to other works in recovery modelling.  (c) We show that our proposed model can be reformulated and solved as a sequence of mixed integer programming models, which can be eﬃciently accomplished by commercial solvers such as CPLEX.  This is computationally attractive compared to more complex but highly non-linear models (see e. g.  Reed et al. , 2009.  Vugrin and Camphouse, 2011).  (d) We show that the critical energy disruptions can depend on both the intersectoral dependencies and the scale of the disruption.  This implies that anticipating and predicting critical sectors (e. g.  for fortiﬁcation purposes) generally cannot be accomplished by simply inspecting and analyzing the Input-Output data.  Besides, resorting to brute force scenario enumeration can become practically infeasible for large systems.  These considerations collectively provide justiﬁcation why automated decision analytics provided by our methodology play an important role in energy resilience studies.  The outline of the paper is as follows.  The next section reviews the literature of related works in the application of Input-Output models and their extensions for energy studies, and also the use of linear programming models in Input-Output analysis.  Section 3 introduces our proposed basic model to compute ﬁnal demand deﬁcits incurred after disruption, the uncertainty model for deﬁning the production disruption scenarios, the model to evaluate the maximum demand deﬁcit, and the proposed energy-economic recovery resilience.  Moreover, to evaluate the maximum impact of the economic system from the uncertain set of production disruption scenarios, we propose an equivalent formulation of the model in the format of a mixed integer linear programming model.  In Section 4, a case study using China 2012 Input-Output data is used to illustrate our methodology in further details.  Finally, Section 5 presents the concluding remarks and suggestions for the future research.  2.  Literature review.  In the past three decades, the Leontief Input-Output model (Leontief, 1986) has been widely used to study energy and economical issues (see the articles, Su and Ang, 2012.  Hoekstra, 2010.  Hawkins et al. , 2015).  Moreover, combining linear programming with Input-Output modelling is a popular approach to study various energy-economy-environment problems in the research literature.  For instance, Wang and Miller (1995) proposed an Input-Output linear programming model to analyze the economic impact of a transportation and energy supply bottleneck on the economy of Taiwan.  Leung and Hsu (1984) proposed the use of an linear programming model to study the economic impacts of energy supply reductions on the Hawaiian economy.  Rose et al.  (1997) used an Input-Output linear program to study the regional economic impact of an earthquake and they found a disruption in electricity was caused by reallocation of the scarce electricity across sectors could reduce the impacts substantially.  Input-Output analysis is also frequently used to assess the economy recovery following disasters.  Hallegatte (2008) applied InputOutput analysis to the landfall of Katrina in Louisiana by taking into account changes in production capacity due to productive losses and adaptive behaviour in the aftermath of a disaster.  Li et al.  (2013) developed a theoretical route map for imbalanced economic recovery called dynamic inequalities based on Input-Output model and applied it to a hypothetical post-disaster economic scenario of ﬂooding in London to assess the inﬂuence of shocks to a regional economy.  Separately, Haimes and Jiang (2001) and Santos and Haimes (2004) used an extension of Leontief Input-Output (i. e. , inoperability InputOutput and dynamic inoperability Input-Output) to quantify the economic losses triggered by terrorism and other disruptive events to economic systems (or industry sectors) where the economic Input-Output data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis was incorporated into the model for economic impact analysis.  The various applications of inoperability Input-Output models can be found in Crowther and Haimes (2005), Crowther et al.  (2007), Anderson et al.  (2007), and Barker and Haimes (2009).  The main strength of the Input-Output approach is in that it enables the analyst to differentiate and quantify impacts in different sectors, through diverse channels of causality, and across regions, though the data required to accomplish that fully are quite extensive (Okuyama and Santos,There are also some published works proposing Input-Output linear programming models to study the recovery of interconnected system due to disruptions.  For instance, Tan (2011) developed an optimization model with inoperability constraints to determine the optimal allocation of various energy sources within a system to corresponding energy sinks or demands, while ensuring that inoperability limits of the latter are satisﬁed for multiple enumerated scenarios.  MacKenzie et al.  (2014) proposed static and dynamic models to determine the optimal resource allocation to facilitate the recovery of impacted industries after a disruption where the objective is to minimize the production losses due to the disruption.  equilibrium, the output from each sector i should match the intermediate demands from all other sectors j for goods i (including itself) and ﬁnal demands fi.  Suppose a production disruption level of 4i has taken place in sector i at a certain point in time (e. g.  t = 0), so that the production level falls to ˆxi − 4i.  Production disruptions in this paper are assumed to be consequences of disruptions in the production capacity of the sector (e. g.  due to attacks on the critical production infrastructures), so that the sector is inhibited from producing at levels greater than ˆxi − 4i.  A supply-demand gap will then appear and the balance in Eq.  (2) cannot be achieved with the equilibrium levels of production outputs ˆx and ﬁnal demands f.  Without any further intervention, the impact on the economy post-disruption is a reduction in all other production outputs due to the inter-sectoral Input-Output dependencies, and consequently compromising the fulﬁlment of the ﬁnal demands.  A new equilibrium is then reached when the ﬁnal demand levels are reduced suﬃciently.  The ﬁnal demands that has been compromised from its original levels in this manner is termed as demand deﬁcits in this work.  Next, we assume that after the disruption event, recovery efforts are initiated to restore the production of the disrupted sector to its original equilibrium level.  In reality, the length of the recovery process depends on the effectiveness of the restoration efforts.  As the disrupted sector gradually recovers, the production levels of all other sectors are also restored to their original equilibrium levels.  Based on the above context, we introduce the following InputOutput linear programming model to describe the recovery of the production levels that minimizes the total demand deﬁcits over a horizon of T time periods after the disruption event.  Baghersad and Zobel (2015) used Input-Output linear programming to investigate the economic consequences of production capacity bottlenecks caused by disasters.  They also consider recovery operations within disrupted sectors, from the standpoint of evaluating the performance of the economy during the transition period after a disaster.
