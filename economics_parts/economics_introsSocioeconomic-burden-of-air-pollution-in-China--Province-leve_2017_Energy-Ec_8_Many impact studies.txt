China’s excess air pollution is widely known.  In 2014, for example,
annual ﬁne particulate (PM2. 5) levels in 31 Chinese major cities (4
province-level cities and 27 provincial capitals) were 23-124 μg/m3,
with a mean of 65 μg/m3, exceeding the World Health Organization
(WHO) guideline level of 10 μg/m3 by a factor of N6 (Nam,
forthcoming).  As demonstrated by a substantial body of the epidemiological literature, conventional air pollutants, such as PM2. 5, increase
health risks substantially (Dockery Name, 1989, 1992.  Dockery and
Pope, 1994).  Given its excessiveness, air pollution in China has posed
enormous and imminent threats to the public health of urban residents. 
Many impact studies motivated to increase public awareness of the
threats have used such epidemiological evidence to estimate pollution-induced socioeconomic burdens.  A conventional approach ﬁrst keeps
track of the morbidity and mortality cases that occur due to exposure
to excess pollution, applying concentration-response functions, drawn
from the epidemiological literature, to given pollution levels.
