 Introduction One of the best-established stylized facts in the decision-making literature is that individuals are over-optimistic about future outcomes (e. g. , Weinstein, 1980).  Over-optimism is related to overconﬁdence but is distinct. 1 Over-optimism creates an upward bias in the mean of the distribution while overconﬁdence creates an upward bias in its precision.  Importantly, prior analytical work also suggests the possibility that over-optimism can increase ﬁrm performance (e. g. , Hackbarth, 2008), but little empirical work exists on this topic.  We investigate this issue empirically.  We ﬁrst note that individuals are over-optimistic in general, and particularly so regarding the effect of their own actions (we call this phenomenon “static over-optimism”).  In addition, managers may suffer from a biased attribution of causality after a series of good performances that leads them to under-estimate the role of random noise and over-attribute successes to their own actions (we call this phenomenon “dynamic overconﬁdence”).  The combination of these two phenomena leads to an increase in over-optimism after a series of successes (we call this phenomenon “dynamic over-optimism”).  optimistic managerial actions (or beliefs) receive an increasingly disproportionate weight in the overall estimation of a project's success.  Thus, our ﬁrst hypothesis posits that the degree of managerial over-optimism should increase after a series of successes.  This miscalibration in managerial prediction may encourage managers to exert greater effort, as they expect this effort to pay-off with a greater likelihood.  Naturally, this additional effort should have a positive effect on ﬁrm performance.  Hence, our second hypothesis conjectures that ﬁrm performance should increase following a series of successes, even if the increase remains below the level expected by an over-optimistic manager.  We note that our hypotheses can be motivated in an economic framework in which individuals are Bayesian.
