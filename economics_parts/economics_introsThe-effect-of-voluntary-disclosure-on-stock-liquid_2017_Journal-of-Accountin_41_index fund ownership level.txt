 Introduction Stock liquidity is central to the efficient functioning of trade in the financial markets and is determined in part by information asymmetry among traders.  Since voluntary disclosure can affect information asymmetry among traders, theoretical research has shown that voluntary disclosure can affect stock liquidity (e. g. , Bushman and Indjejikian, 1995).  However, empirical tests of this mechanism must recognize that a manager's provision of disclosure is a product of many forces, all of which must be identified. 1 It has proved difficult to construct an empirical model of disclosure that incorporates all these forces (e. g. , Joos, 2000.  Leuz and Verrecchia, 2000).  Index funds, by contrast, trade primarily for nonstrategic reasons, and theory suggests that such nonstrategic traders unambiguously prefer higher disclosure relative to privately informed managers and strategic investors.  This implies that I can use index funds' disclosure preferences to construct an empirical model of voluntary disclosure that abstracts away from managers' strategic disclosure motives.  Accordingly, I use an index-fund setting to construct a recursive model of voluntary disclosure, index fund ownership, and stock liquidity, and demonstrate that voluntary disclosure increases stock liquidity.  The effect of index fund ownership on liquidity can arise from two mechanisms.  (1) index funds' unambiguous preference for additional disclosure, and (2) index fund ownership itself (e. g. , increased nonstrategic trading related to portfolio rebalancing).  Separating these two mechanisms is crucial for understanding the determinants of liquidity, but it cannot be done with simple OLS or regression discontinuity (RD) techniques.  For example, even if index funds elicit more disclosure from managers, instrumenting disclosure with index fund ownership does not solve the identification problem.  Any effect on liquidity related to common variation in disclosure and index fund ownership could be due to either increased disclosure or index fund ownership itself (the same is true for RD designs).  An appropriate empirical solution for separating these effects is to construct structural equations for disclosure and index fund ownership, and then to use recursive estimation to obtain each mechanism's liquidity effect (Greene, 2002, p.  397). 2 Constructing the recursive model requires that index fund ownership be properly identified.  To achieve this goal, I use an index-fund-inclusion setting.  An important feature of this setting is that changes in the index's constituent firms are made by the index's governing body (such as S&P), and are therefore exogenous to index funds themselves.  When a firm is added, index funds must take an ownership position in that firm, and this exogenous ownership position confers control rights.  When index funds acquire control rights through ownership, any link between an increase in voluntary disclosure due to this control and stock liquidity can be construed as causal.  By contrast, it is harder to make such claims for strategic investors (including managers) without explicitly modeling their endogenous preferences for disclosure, ownership, and liquidity.  The same goes for atomistic or retail traders, who can trade at will according to their disclosure preferences and are too small to influence managers' disclosure choices.  I use inclusion in the S&P 500 index as the key economic phenomenon to test whether disclosure affects stock liquidity.  At the time of a firm's index inclusion, the ownership level assumed by index funds is determined by their assets under management (AUM).  Since index fund AUM varies across time and index inclusions occur throughout time, the index-fund setting generates substantial variation in index fund ownership.  This setting has other benefits as well.  Since firm managers can neither influence index fund AUM nor control the timing of index inclusions, the index fund ownership stake is exogenous to the firm (see Section 3. 1).  From the index fund perspective, prior research suggests that variation in index fund ownership is not due to strategic stock selection (see Section 2).  In addition, S&P makes public their index-inclusion criteria, which I use to match each inclusion firm to a control firm (using propensity scores).  Exploiting each inclusion firm's behavior pre and post inclusion relative to the matched control firm results in a difference-in-differences (D-in-D) regression setting that eliminates any time-varying effects common to both firms and differences away any firm-fixed effects.  Importantly, the D-in-D design also controls for any “index-inclusion” effect common to all inclusion firms (for disclosure and liquidity).  I use a sample of 368 firms added to the S&P 500 index over the period of 1996–2010 (and 368 control firms).  In my sample, 78% of index inclusions occur due to a merger or an acquisition involving an existing index firm, which frees up a spot in the index.  Upon index inclusion, the ensuing index fund ownership level in my sample firms is economically meaningful, ranging from 3. 9% to 10.
