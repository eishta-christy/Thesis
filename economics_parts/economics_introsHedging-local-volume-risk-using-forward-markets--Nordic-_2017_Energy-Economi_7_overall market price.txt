The Nordic electricity market was liberalized in the late 90’s to
increase competition and create incentive to invest in new generation capacity and modernize existing production.  At the same time,
the liberalization reduced the barriers on import and export between
countries, allowing for more eﬃcient use of many power production
technologies. 
Currently, the Nordic market covers the countries in the Nordic
and Baltic regions, i. e.  Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania. 
It is divided into 17 bidding areas with individual area prices based on local supply and demand.  Furthermore, an overall market price for electricity, referred to as the system
price, is determined for contractual purposes.  This price is based
on aggregated supply and demand and disregards transmission constraints between bidding areas.
