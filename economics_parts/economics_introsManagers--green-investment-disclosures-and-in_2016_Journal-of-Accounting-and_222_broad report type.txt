Although not required, most large companies now issue reports on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. 1
This voluntary disclosure of CSR activities is likely driven at least in part by a desire to communicate CSR information to
investors.  If CSR activities affect the company’s future earnings and cash ﬂows, investors will ﬁnd related disclosures useful
for their valuation decisions.  However, it is possible that investors react to CSR disclosures for another reason as well.  If
investors value the societal beneﬁts associated with CSR activities, they may respond positively to disclosures that the
company has engaged in such activities independent of how they expect the activities to affect future earnings and cash
ﬂows.  We conduct an experiment to test whether investors respond to managers’ disclosure of their CSR investment
independent of the effect on the company’s future cash ﬂows.  In addition, we examine whether managers anticipate
investors’ response when making their disclosure decisions.  Finally, we examine whether managers’ CSR investment
decisions are driven only by investors’ expected response or also by their preferences for the societal beneﬁts associated
with their CSR investments. 
Understanding how investors’ respond to CSR disclosure is important because this can help explain managers’ voluntary
CSR disclosure practices.  For example, knowing that investors value the societal beneﬁts of CSR activities would help explain
why managers’ CSR disclosures tend to focus on such beneﬁts.  Also, knowing whether investors’ reaction to CSR disclosures
goes beyond the expected effect of CSR activities on the company’s future cash ﬂows could help explain the rapid growth in
Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) funds (Social Investment Forum Foundation, 2012).  More broadly, a more complete
understanding of investors’ reaction to CSR disclosure can inform standard setters who are considering whether CSR disclosures should be required, what information should be disclosed, and whether such disclosures should be audited. 2
Finally, understanding why managers invest in CSR activities helps inform the ongoing debate regarding whether all CSR
activities must be shareholder value maximizing (Friedman, 1970; Karnani, 2010) or whether some such activities sacriﬁce
proﬁts in the social interest (Benabou and Tirole, 2010; Reinhart Name, 2008; Kolstad, 2007). 
We examine a particular type of CSR activity, green investment to reduce carbon emissions, in an experimental market
setting.  There are several critical features of our setting that allow us to isolate the effects necessary to answer our research
questions.  First, in our experimental setting, the impact of a manager’s green investment is fully reﬂected in the company’s
current earnings, and as such there can be no further impact on the company’s future cash ﬂows.  This ensures that any
observed investor reaction to disclosure of the green investment is not based on investors’ expectations regarding how the
investment will affect future earnings.  Second, we ensure that both investors and managers in our experiment know that
the ﬁnancial cost to the company of a green investment always exceeds the ﬁnancial beneﬁt, i. e. , the investment is always
unproﬁtable.  Thus, any green investment a manager makes always lowers shareholder value, and therefore any positive
investor response to the disclosure of a green investment must reﬂect the investors’ desire to reward the manager for
engaging in an activity that the investors value. 
We ﬁnd that potential investors’ standardized bids for the company are higher when managers disclose their green
investments than when they do not, providing evidence that investors value the societal beneﬁts associated with the
investment.  We also provide some evidence that investors respond more positively when managers’ disclosures focus on
the societal beneﬁts of their investment rather than on the cost to the company.  In addition, managers anticipate investors’
reaction and thus overwhelmingly disclose their investment and tend to focus their disclosure on the societal beneﬁts of the
investment rather than on the cost to the company.  Finally, despite investors’ positive response to a disclosed green
investment, both managers and current shareholders nevertheless bear a cost when the manager makes a green investment. 
Thus, managers’ investment decisions must reﬂect the value they place on the associated societal beneﬁts in addition to any
expected investor response. 
Our ﬁndings contribute to the CSR literature in several ways.  First, our ﬁnding that investors’ positive response to disclosures of a green investment are based at least in part on the societal beneﬁts associated with the investments helps us
better understand the rapid increase in SRI funds (Social Investment Forum Foundation, 2012).  Second, our results offer
insights into how and why managers disclose their CSR activities to investors.  Third, our study helps inform standard setters
who are considering possible CSR disclosure requirements.  Finally, our study demonstrates the advantages of using
experiments to examine important CSR issues that are difﬁcult to study effectively using archival data. 
In Sections 2 and 3 we provide background information and present our hypotheses.  We describe our experiment in
Section 4 and report our results in Section 5.  The paper concludes with a discussion of our results and their implications in
Section 6. 
2.  Background. 
The KPMG International Survey of CSR (2013) reports that 93 percent of the 250 largest global companies and 86 percent
of the 100 largest US companies now engage in some type of voluntary CSR disclosure.  If CSR activities affect the company’s
future earnings and cash ﬂows, disclosing such activities will be useful for investors’ valuation decisions.  There are several
ways that CSR performance could affect a company’s future earnings.  For example, being more socially responsible could
add customers, increase sales, or increase pricing power (Lev Name, 2010), attract or motivate employees (Balakrisnan Name,
2011, Bhattacharya Name, 2008), lower the cost of equity capital (Dhaliwal Name, 2011) or reduce the risk of governmental
regulation (Paine, 2000).  Based on such arguments, researchers have often focused on establishing a positive association
between CSR and measures of ﬁnancial performance.  Margolis Name (2009) conduct a meta-analysis of 251 such studies over
the last 40 years and conclude that “the overall effect is positive but small…and the results for the 106 studies for the past
decade are even smaller. ” Of the 251 studies, 59% reported a non-signiﬁcant result, 28% found a positive result, 2% a negative
result, and the remaining 10% did not report sample size or signiﬁcance. 
Although the prior research does not completely resolve whether companies’ CSR performance is associated with their
future ﬁnancial performance, investors’ reactions to CSR disclosures are likely to be at least partially based on their
expectations about the effect on ﬁnancial performance.  However, investors could also react to CSR disclosures because they
value the societal beneﬁts associated with CSR activities.  Such a reaction would be difﬁcult to isolate using archival data
because it occurs simultaneously with any reaction based on expectations of how CSR activities affect earnings.  We overcome this problem by using an experimental setting in which the impact of the CSR activity is fully incorporated into current
earnings.  This ensures that any investor reaction is not due to expectations regarding the impact of CSR activities on future
cash ﬂows. 
3.  Development of hypotheses. 
A positive response by investors to disclosed CSR activities could reﬂect their desire to reward company managers for
taking an action they value.  The recent rapid growth in SRI funds is consistent with an expanding group of investors
rewarding companies for being socially responsible. 3 Such behavior is consistent with the social norm of reciprocity, in
which a kind act is reciprocated with a similarly kind act in return (Rabin, 1993).  Reciprocity has been documented in many
settings including labor markets and other experimental games.  In labor market settings, prior studies show that in
incomplete contract environments, employers often offer a “gift” of a wage greater than the market-clearing level and
workers reciprocate with a “gift” of greater effort than the minimum enforceable amount (Akerlof, 1982; Fehr Name, 1993,
1997; Hannan Name, 2002; Hannan, 2005; Kuang and Moser, 2009, 2011). 4 Another widely studied experimental setting
documenting reciprocity is the “trust game” (Berg Name, 1995), in which a ﬁrst mover is given a sum of money and decides
how much of it to give to an anonymous counterparty.  Any money given is increased by a multiplier, and then the counterparty decides how much of this new amount to give back to the ﬁrst mover and how much to keep for him/herself.  The
ﬁrst mover in this setting typically transfers a signiﬁcant portion of their money to the counterparty, and the counterparty
reciprocates this action by returning a signiﬁcant amount of the new multiplied amount to the ﬁrst mover. 
Our experimental setting shares some features with the gift-exchange and trust games described above in that our
managers are similar to the employers in the gift-exchange studies and to the ﬁrst movers in the trust game studies, while
our investors are similar to the workers in the gift-exchange studies and the counterparty in the trust game studies. 
However, our setting differs from the previous settings in important ways.  First, while the manager’s green investment in
our study is similar to the employer’s gift and ﬁrst mover’s transfer in the previous studies, it differs in that, unlike in the
previous studies, the manager’s green investment does not ﬁnancially beneﬁt the investors directly.  Therefore, in our setting
any reciprocal motivation on the part of investors must operate through the value they place on the societal beneﬁts of the
green investment rather than on any potential personal ﬁnancial gain.  Second, managers who make a green investment in
our setting affect both their own wealth and the wealth of another current shareholder.  In the other settings, when
employers (ﬁrst movers) offer a gift (transfer), they only reduce their own wealth.  Third, in prior studies, the employee
(second mover) could directly reciprocate the employer’s (ﬁrst mover’s) behavior, but in our market setting, it is less clear
that any individual investor can directly reciprocate the manager’s behavior because only the winning bidder can ultimatelyThe differences described above make reciprocation by investors less likely in our setting than in previous reciprocity
studies.  Nevertheless, there are still reasons to expect that investors will react positively when managers disclose their
green investment.  Martin (2009) found that investors in a market setting similar to ours were willing to bear part, but not
all, of the cost of a green investment made by the sole owner of a company.  Elfenbein and McManus (2010) used data from
eBay auctions to show that customers were more likely to buy, and pay higher prices for, items for which the seller had
committed to donate a portion of the sales proceeds to charity than identical items for which the seller had not made such a
commitment.  Again, the higher prices paid by customers reduced, but did not fully offset, the cost to the company of the
charitable contribution.  Finally, Balakrishnan Name (2011) provide evidence that employer charitable giving can help
motivate employee effort that beneﬁts the employer, but, again, many employers only recovered part of the cost of their
charitable donations.  Thus, our ﬁrst hypothesis is:
Hypothesis 1(H1).  Holding the distribution of possible cash ﬂows constant, investors will respond more positively to
disclosure of a green investment than to no report about green investing. 
As hypothesized above, we expect investors who value the societal beneﬁts of green investments to reciprocate the
manager’s behavior by paying higher prices when managers disclose that they made a green investment.  However, investor
reaction is also expected to vary depending on how managers frame their green investment disclosure.  Different framing of
equivalent information has been shown to inﬂuence individuals’ judgments in many different settings (see Levin Name, 1998
for a review of the framing literature).  If investors’ reciprocal response reﬂects the value they place on the societal beneﬁts
of a green investment, they are likely to respond more favorably to reports that focus on the societal beneﬁts of the
investment rather than on the cost of the investment to the company.  Thus, our second hypothesis is:
Hypothesis 2 (H2).  Investors will react more positively to disclosures that focus on the societal beneﬁts of green investments than to disclosures that focus on the costs to the company of such investments. 
Since disclosures of CSR activities are largely voluntary, managers can decide what, if anything, they wish to disclose
about such activities.  Managers likely decide what to disclose based on their expectations regarding investors’ reaction. 
However, in our experimental setting the impact of the green investment is fully incorporated into the company’s current
earnings, and thus managers’ disclosure decisions must be based on expectations of investors’ response to non-economic
information in the disclosure.  If investors respond as predicted in H1 and H2, managers would likely either anticipate or
learn which forms of disclosure yield the most positive investor response.  Thus, our third and fourth hypotheses are:
Hypothesis 3 (H3).  Managers who make a green investment will more often disclose to investors that they have done so
rather than make no report. 
Hypothesis 4 (H4).  Managers’ disclosures of their green investment will more often focus on the societal beneﬁts of the
investment than on the cost to the company. 
Because in our setting any green investment is always unproﬁtable, the manager and the other current shareholder will
always bear a cost when the manager makes a green investment unless investors reciprocate sufﬁciently to offset the full
cost of the unproﬁtable investment.  If managers are repeatedly willing to bear a personal cost and to impose a cost on the
other current shareholders, this suggests that their green investments do not reﬂect a naive belief that investors will fully
compensate them for the cost of the investment.  Rather, managers’ green investments must reﬂect the personal value they
place on the societal beneﬁts of such investments. 
<Middle> Experiment. 
4. 1.  Overview. 
We conducted our experimental markets using z-tree software (Fischbacher, 2007) in a networked computer lab.  We
recruited 90 volunteer participants from the lab participant pool of approximately 1,300 individuals.  Our participants were
55% male and averaged 21 years of age.  Three experimental sessions with 30 participants each were conducted.  Each session
consisted of 20 independent periods and lasted approximately 90 minutes.  At the conclusion of each session, one of the 20
periods was randomly selected and participants were paid their $5 participation fee plus their earnings for the randomly
selected period.  Participants’ earnings depended on the decisions that they and other participants made during the
experiment (details provided below). 
In each of the three sessions, participants were randomly assigned to one of three roles: (1) a manager who was a
shareholder in the company, (2) another current shareholder in the company, or (3) one of three potential investors in the
company, and these roles were constant throughout the experiment.  We distinguish between “potential investors” and
“current shareholders” in our setting and measure investor reaction based on the price set by the potential investors. 
Although our other current shareholders do not play a role in setting the market price, we included them in our design to
reﬂect the fact that, like our managers, they also bear a direct ﬁnancial cost when managers make an unproﬁtable green
investment. 
Each period, one manager was randomly matched with one current shareholder and three potential investors, creating a
group of 5 participants.  There were 6 such groups of 5 in each of our 3 experimental sessions, resulting in a total of 18
groups.  Thus, our 90 participants consisted of 18 managers (one per group), 18 current shareholders (one per group) and 54
potential investors (three per group).  With 20 periods in each session, this resulted in 360 observations (investment and
reporting decisions) from managers (18 managers  20 periods) and 360 observations (winning bids) from the potential
investors (one winning bid for each of the 18 groups of three investors  20 periods).  Because managers, current shareholders, and potential investors were randomly re-matched into new 5-member groups each period, they never knew with
whom they were matched at any point in their experimental session.  Therefore, participants knew that all decisions were
anonymous and neither managers nor investors could form reputations. 5
At the start of each period, the manager and the other current shareholder each owned one-half of the company.  This
ownership structure captures forces that are important in actual corporate settings.  Speciﬁcally, this structure provides
managers with (1) a personal ﬁnancial deterrent against investing in the unproﬁtable green project, (2) a deterrent against
investing in the unproﬁtable green project because of a ﬁduciary responsibility to the other current shareholder, and (3) an
incentive to invest in the unproﬁtable green project because half of the cost of the investment can be shifted to the other
current shareholder. 
Managers decided whether to make a green investment and what to disclose about their investment choice to potential
investors.  Potential investors then placed bids to purchase the company.  Both managers and potential investors knew that
any amount of green investment that was made had a real societal beneﬁt in reducing carbon emissions because they knew
that the full amount of any green investment would be donated by the researchers to Carbonfund. org, a real non-proﬁt
environmental organization that invests contributions in renewable energy and reforestation projects that reduce the
amount of greenhouse gases in the environment. 6 After the experiment was completed, the actual dollar amount of the
green investment made by managers for the randomly selected payment period was contributed to Carbonfund. org. 
4. 2.  Detailed experimental procedures. 
A time-line of the steps in each period of each experimental session is provided in Fig.  1.  As shown in Step 1, each period
managers learned the amount of earnings for the company before they made any green investment (hereafter referred to as
the “before-investment earnings”) and then decided whether to invest a portion of those earnings to reduce carbon
emissions.  Possible green investment amounts ranged from $0 to $20 in $1 increments. 
The company’s before-investment earnings for each period were drawn from a uniform distribution ranging from $25 to
$35 in two stages.  In the ﬁrst stage, a distribution with a smaller $5 range was randomly drawn from the uniformly distributed larger $10 range ($25–$35).  We refer to this smaller $5 range as the “before-investment earnings range. ” In the
second stage, the before-investment earnings amount (i. e. , a single speciﬁc earnings amount) was randomly drawn from the
uniformly distributed smaller $5 before-investment earnings range.  This speciﬁc amount is the before-investment earnings
amount that managers saw before making their green investment decision.  As described in more detail later, the company’s
before-investment earnings were selected using this two-stage process to limit the inferences potential investors could
make regarding whether a green investment had been made. 
Because any amount of green investment reduced the company’s energy costs, the net cost of the green investment to
the company was always less than the amount contributed to Carbonfund. org.  (hereafter referred to as the societal beneﬁt
associated with the investment). 7 In other words, every $1 of green investment the manager made to reduce carbon
emissions resulted in a net cost to the company of $0. 50.  This design feature reﬂects the fact that in many cases green
investments have both societal beneﬁts and ﬁnancial beneﬁts for the company and that in some cases the beneﬁts to society
exceed the costs to the company. 
As shown in Step 2, after managers made their investment decision, they decided what information to disclose about
their decision to the potential investors and the other current shareholder.  Managers chose one of the reporting options
shown in Table 1 depending on whether they chose to make a green investment.  If they made a green investment, they
could (1) send no report, (2) disclose that they made an investment to reduce carbon emissions without any amounts,
(3) disclose that they made an investment to reduce carbon emissions along with the amount of the investment, (4) disclose
that they made an investment to reduce carbon emissions along with both the amount of investment and the related cost to
the company, or (5) disclose that they made an investment to reduce carbon emissions along with only the net cost to the
company.  If they did not make a green investment, they could (1) send no report, or (2) send a report indicating that they
did not make an investment to reduce carbon emissions.  Table 1 provides the exact wording used on the computer screens
for each type of report.  The computer program ensured that any report the manager made to the investors was truthful. 8
Any disclosure managers chose to make was provided to the potential investors, along with the $5 range of possible
after-investment earnings.  This $5 range of after-investment cash ﬂows was obtained by subtracting the cost to the company
of any green investment the manager made from the $5 before-investment range described above. 9
As shown in Step 3, after receiving the $5. 00 range of equally likely after-investment company earnings and any report
that the manager chose to provide, each potential investor submitted a bid indicating the price s/he was willing to pay for
the entire company.  At the start of each period, each potential investor received a $30. 00 endowment amount, which along
with the $5. 00 participation fee could be used to purchase the company.  The potential investor making the highest bid
purchased the company from the manager and current shareholder.  In the event of a tie, the computer randomly determined which potential investor making a highest bid purchased the company.  At the conclusion of each period, potential
investors were required to repay $15 of their $30 endowment. 10
8 As in much of the prior disclosure literature (Verrecchia, 1983; King and Wallin, 1995; Forsythe Name, 1999), we assumed there was an anti-fraud
provision that prevented false reporting.  That is, managers in our experiment could only truthfully report whether they invested to reduce carbon
emissions, and if they chose to report the amount of their investment or the cost to the company of their investment, these amounts had to be reported
truthfully as well.  We required truthful reporting to ensure a clean test of investors’ reaction to the content of the reports.  We did not allow blatantly
dishonest reporting (e. g. , reporting that a green investment was made when none actually was) for two reasons: (1) investors’ reactions to the reports
would have been confounded by their concerns regarding the credibility (versus the content) of the report, and (2) we were concerned that the amount of
dishonest reporting and investors’ expectations of such reporting would be higher in the experiment than in actual corporate settings where there would
be consequences if the lies were exposed.  We note that our managers still had considerable leeway in what information they chose to disclose, ranging
from disclosing no information to full information about their green investments and the cost to the company. 
As shown in Step 4, the potential investor making the highest bid purchased the company from the manager and current
shareholder.  Because the amount paid by the potential investor who purchased the company is shared evenly by the
manager and the other current shareholder as 50% owners, potential investors knew that their bidding decisions would
affect the wealth of both the manager and the other current shareholder. 
As shown in Step 5, after the winning bid was determined, potential investors learned which speciﬁc amount from the
$5. 00 distribution of equally likely after-investment earnings was the actual after-investment earnings amount.  This amount
was paid as a liquidating dividend to the potential investor who purchased the company. 
Finally, as shown in Step 6, participants’ payoffs for the period were determined as speciﬁed in Table 2.  Because managers initially owned one-half of the company, they received 50% of selling price of the company (i. e. , the winning bid) plus
their $5 participation fee.  Potential investors’ payoffs depended on whether they purchased the company.  Potential
investors who purchased the company received the liquidating dividend (i. e. , the actual company earnings) minus the price
they paid to buy the company plus their $5 participation fee plus $15 ($30 endowment minus $15 repayment).  Potential
investors who did not purchase the company received their $5 participation fee plus $15 ($30 endowment minus $15
repayment).  Because current shareholders initially owned one-half of the company, they received 50% of the selling price of
the company plus their $5 participation fee.  The six steps described above were repeated for each of the 20 periods in each
of the three experimental sessions. 
After all periods were completed, participants responded to a post-experiment questionnaire, a volunteer participant
drew a number from a container holding the numbers 1 through 20 to determine the payment period, and participants
received their participation fee and their payoff amount for this randomly selected period. 
4. 3.  Procedures to limit investor inferences. 
Two features of the experimental procedures described above were designed speciﬁcally to limit investors’ inferences
about whether a green investment was made or the amount or cost of any investment.  First, the managers knew the
underlying $10 distribution from which the smaller $5 before-investment earnings ranges were selected, but the potential
investors were never provided any information about this larger initial distribution.  Using a fairly wide range of randomly
selected smaller distributions drawn from the larger distribution ensured that there was signiﬁcant variation in the distributions potential investors encountered across periods. 11 Had the same distribution been used each period, repeated
observations may have allowed potential investors to infer the distribution and therefore infer whether the manager had
made a green investment.  In addition, had potential investors known that the underlying range was from $25 to $35, they
would have been able to infer the amount of any green investment for some randomly drawn smaller distributions because
the after-investment distribution could have included an amount below $25.  For example, a green investment with a cost to
the company of $2 could have resulted in a range of $23–$28 being shown to potential investors, allowing the investors to
infer that the manager had made a green investment with a cost to the company of at least $2. 
Second, managers making a green investment knew that their investment reduced the company’s energy cost by an
amount equal to 50% of their investment, but this exact percent of cost reduction was not known by the potential
investors. 12 If potential investors had been provided with this exact percentage (i. e. , 50%), they would have been able to infer
with certainty either the amount of the investment (i. e. , the societal beneﬁt) or the net cost to the company whenever the
manager chose to disclose either one of these in their reports.  For example, if the manager’s report disclosed that the green
investment was $2, potential investors would have been able to infer with certainty that the net cost to the company was $1. 
Likewise, if the manager’s report disclosed that the cost to the company was $1, potential investors would have been able to
infer with certainty that the amount of the green investment was $2.  Because we are interested in potential investors’
reaction to the speciﬁc information that managers choose to disclose, it was important that investors not be able to infer
information about managers’ green investment decisions beyond that disclosed by the managers. 
We took the steps described above to limit investors’ inferences about the manager’s green investment decision even though
any report the manager provided to investors was irrelevant for how wealth-maximizing investors would value the company
because their bids would be based exclusively on the after-investment distribution of cash ﬂows.  However, because our
hypotheses assume that some potential investors value the societal beneﬁts of green investments, it was important that they
could not infer information about the manager’s investments beyond that disclosed by the managers.  Although our procedures
severely limited any inferences investors could make about the manager’s green investment, we cannot be certain that investors
did not infer any information about the manager’s investment as they gained experience in the market after multiple periods. 
However, if investors did infer any information regarding a manager’s green investment beyond that disclosed by the manager,
this works against ﬁnding differences in investors’ bidding behavior across different disclosures. 
5.  Results. 
5. 1.  Overview. 
Our ﬁrst two hypotheses relate to investors’ reactions to managers’ disclosures.  In order to test these hypotheses, it is
necessary to ﬁrst show that some managers made green investments and that there was variation in what managers disclosed to potential investors about their investments.  As explained earlier, our experimental design yields 360 group-level
responses (i. e. , 18 groups  20 periods).  Panels A and B of Table 3 report the frequency and percentage of green investments
by amount of green investment (Panel A) and frequency and percentage of report type (Panel B). 
Recall that in our setting wealth maximizing managers would never make a green investment unless they expected
investors to fully compensate them for the personal cost they bear to make the investment.  Neoclassical economic theory
also predicts that managers’ disclosures will not affect wealth maximizing potential investors’ behavior, and thus managers
will be indifferent as to what they disclose to investors.  Panel A of Table 3 shows that managers made a green investment
50% of the time (180 out of 360 cases).  Panel B of Table 3 shows that, while there is variation in report type, managers made
some report types more often than others, which suggests that they expect that potential investors value the societal
beneﬁts of green investing and thus may react more positively to some report types than others.  We discuss managers’
behavior in more detail later in conjunction with the tests of our H3 and H4. 
5. 2.  Test of H1. 
Table 4 reports descriptive statistics by type of report managers made to investors.  For each broad report type group,
Panel A of Table 4 shows the frequency of such reports, the average before-investment earnings range, the managers’
average green investment amount, the average net cost of the investment to the company (i. e.
