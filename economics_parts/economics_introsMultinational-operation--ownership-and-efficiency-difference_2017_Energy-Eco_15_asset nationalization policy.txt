About $2 billion of petroleum are traded daily, making petroleum
the single largest item in the balance of payment and exchange between
countries (Tordo etal. , 2011).  Economies are susceptible to oil supply
and price volatility as a result of their strong dependence on oil-based
products (Cuñado and Pérez de Gracia, 2003.  Jiménez-Rodríguez and
Sánchez, 2005).  This is probably the reason for state interventions in
the industry, in the form of National Oil Companies (NOCs).  State ownership of oil companies started in 1914 when the British government acquired a controlling stake in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, now
British Petroleum (BP), setting a precedent for the many state-owned
oil companies to follow in other countries (Wolf, 2009).  Since 1991,
countries that possess NOCs have held nearly 90% of global crude oil reserves (Eller etal. , 2011).  Various governments have seen the oil industry far important to be left in the hands of private International Oil
Companies (IOCs) as direct state control over its resources is a strong indicator of national sovereignty (Mommer, 2002).  State ownership in
this industry is at the heart of debates on state interventionism, asset
nationalization and deregulation policies in the oil industry.  This notwithstanding, to some researchers direct state intervention is seen as
a major cause of inefﬁciency in this industry (Kashani, 2005a, 2005b). 
The issue of state ownership versus private ownership of oil companies
has become the overarching theme of most efﬁciency-related studies in
the industry.  Indeed, Al-Obaidan and Scully (1992), Eller etal.  (2011),
Ike and Lee (2014), Wolf (2009), and Sueyoshi and Goto (2012) have
all provided empirical evidence on the differences in the efﬁciency of
state controlled oil companies and privately controlled ones. 
Although, these studies mostly favour private ownership, the debate
is not dwindling since high energy prices, asset nationalization policy
and economic success of some NOCs have re-ignited calls for more
state involvement (Wolf, 2009).  There is therefore the need to reconsider how state ﬁrms can be more productive, and stay relevant in this volatile industry, compared to their private counterparts.
