Private enforcement via shareholder litigation is important to investor protection and stock market development
(La Porta Name, 2006).  Prior literature suggests that cross-country variation in shareholder litigation threat affects the cost of
equity (Hail and Leuz, 2009; Khurana and Raman, 2004).  However, there is relatively scant evidence on how firm-level
mechanisms affect the disciplining role of shareholder litigation and therefore the cost of equity.  This research question is
important as the cost of equity is a summary measure of how investors perceive the risk and return tradeoff of investing in a
firm (Francis Name, 2004).  In addition, the cost of equity plays a key role in corporate financing and capital budgeting
decisions.  In this study, we examine how directors' and officers' liability insurance (D&O insurance) affects a firm’s cost ofD&O insurance is a policy purchased by a firm to cover defense cost and potential damage award when its directors and
officers (D&Os) are sued.  By effectively shielding D&Os from bearing personal financial liabilities, D&O insurance reduces the
disciplining effect of shareholder litigation (Baker and Griffith, 2010).  We hypothesize that D&O insurance increases a firm’s
cost of equity via two important channels.  First, as shareholder litigation encourages managers to increase transparency
(Ball, 2001), D&O insurance can result in poor financial reporting and disclosure quality, leading to a higher cost of equity
(Leuz and Wysocki, 2008).  Second, as D&O insurance limits the expected legal liabilities associated with bad outcomes of
D&O decisions, it encourages risk-taking (Baker and Griffith, 2010; Core, 1997).  To the extent that risk-taking results in a
higher exposure to market risks, the cost of equity is higher. 
Using a large manually collected dataset on D&O insurance from Canada, we find that D&O insurance coverage is
positively associated with the ex ante cost of equity implied in stock prices and analyst forecasts.  This association is robust to
firm fixed effects regression and alternative cost of equity measures.  It is also economically significant.  Based on our baseline
model, an increase in D&O insurance coverage by one standard deviation is associated with an increase in the cost of equity
of about 7% of the sample mean. 
The positive association between D&O insurance and the cost of equity can be driven by endogeneity as D&O insurance
purchase is a firm’s choice.  It can be the case that high risks lead to both high D&O insurance coverage and a high cost of
equity.  We conduct extensive tests to mitigate this concern.  First, we control for economic determinants of liability coverage
and corporate governance quality (Chen Name, 2011; Core, 1997, 2000).  We continue to find a positive association between
D&O insurance and the cost of equity.  Second, we conduct a lead-lag change analysis.  If it is risk, which is already known by
investors and manifested in the cost of equity, determines a firm’s decision to purchase D&O insurance, then a change in the
cost of equity should precede a change in D&O insurance.  In contrast, our hypothesis predicts that a change in the cost of
equity follows a change in D&O insurance coverage.  We find that a change in the cost of equity follows, but not precedes, a
change in D&O insurance coverage. 
Next, we examine the market reaction to the release of proxy circulars that contain D&O insurance information.  A shortterm market event study is less likely to suffer from the omitted correlated variable bias.  If investors charge a high cost of
equity for firms with a high level of D&O insurance coverage, then they would react negatively to the disclosure of an
increase in D&O insurance.
