 1.  Introduction Many countries subsidise the production and consumption of fossil fuels.  Most subsidies are given downstream, to reduce the cost of consuming fossil fuels (Coady et al. , 2016).  While these subsidies beneﬁt fuel consumers, at least in the short run, they also have a number of negative effects (IEA, 2014).  First, they contribute to ﬁscal imbalances and thus crowd out other government spending.  Second, subsidies stimulate excessive fossil fuel consumption contributing to increased emissions of harmful pollution such as CO2.  Finally, in the long run low oil prices encourage the development of energy-intensive industries and discourage development of renewable technologies.  Despite the negative effects, it has proven difﬁcult to remove fossil fuel subsidies.  In many countries fossil fuel subsidies were originally introduced to improve consumer welfare, and proposals to remove such subsidies could result in citizen protests.  We ﬁnd, however, that the biggest subsidisers may increase their welfare by removing their oil subsidies.  The reason is that subsidy removal allows these countries to shift oil from the domestic market to the international market where prices are higher.  The biggest fossil fuel subsidisers are also major producers and exporters of oil and gas.  In fact, the heaviest fossil fuel subsidisers are the OPEC countries, mostly located in the Middle-East and North-Africa (MENA) region.  Public spending on subsidies – estimated as the gap between international and domestic prices – is, on average, much higher in the oil exporting MENA region than in other countries.
