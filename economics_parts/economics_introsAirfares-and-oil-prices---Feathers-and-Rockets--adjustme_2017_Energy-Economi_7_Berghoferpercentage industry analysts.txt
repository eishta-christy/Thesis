The price of crude oil declines by about 57%, from $102. 51 to $43. 58
between June 2014 and May 2016.  During that period, the CPI for airfare
declines by about 12%.  This small decline is somewhat surprising.  jet fuel
accounts for about 33% of average operating costs incurred by the airline
industry (Berghofer and Lucey, 2014).  Consistent with this large percentage, industry analysts estimate that the reduction in oil prices will save US
airlines about $20 billion in 2015 (New York Times, January 20, 2015). 
The juxtaposition of a large cost saving and a relatively small
price reduction is a topic for both academic researchers and policy
enforcement.
