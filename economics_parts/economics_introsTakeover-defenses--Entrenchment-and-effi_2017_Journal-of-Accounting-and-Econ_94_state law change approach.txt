Corporate takeovers have lon g been considered a governance mechanism that can help reduce management entrenchment and improve productive efficiency of management (e. g. , Grossman and Hart, 1980; Fama, 1980; Jensen and
Ruback, 1983; Scharfstein, 1988, Jensen, 1993). 1 Consequently, firms that have antitakeover provisions (henceforth ATPs) in
place are often considered to be relatively inefficient.  Consistent with the perceived inefficiency of ATPs, a stream of research
finds that high ATP firms have lower accounting performance, lower Tobin's Q, and lower reinvestment rates, relative to low
ATP firms (e. g. , Gompers, Ishii and Metrick, 2003; Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; Bebchuk and Cohen, 2005; Bebchuk,
Cohen and Ferrell, 2009; Cohen and Wang, 2013).  However, despite negative portrayals in much of the archival research and
popular opinion, ATPs remain prevalent among the S&P 500 companies, with about 60% of these firms having staggered
boards and poison pills in place.  These provisions are also common in the charters of initial public offerings (Daines, 2001;
Daines and Klausner, 2001).  If ATPs unambiguously lead to inefficiencies, the question arises as to why market forces have
not eliminated their use over time. 
In this paper we attempt to address this disconnect by exploring the potential role of ATPs in long-term value creation. 
We identify a set of firms focused on long-term growth (innovative firms) that are most likely to benefit from ATPs and use
an exogenous event to isolate the benefit. 2 We suggest that while the threat of corporate takeovers can curb managerial
inefficiencies, it can also create incentives for myopic behavior by managers.  Fear of takeover and the associated employment risk may cause managers to take actions that are focused on maximizing short-term price rather than long-term value. 
Jensen (2005) states that “when numbers are manipulated to tell the market what they want to hear … and when real
operating decisions that would maximize value are compromised to meet market expectations, real long-term value is being
destroyed. ”.  Stein (1988) argues that ATPs can help managers pursue long-term goals more effectively by insulating them
from short-term market pressures.  The reasoning is that capital market pressures, including the threat of takeovers and the
associated employment risk, can cause management to behave myopically, shun projects that may carry a higher risk of
early failures, and focus on maximizing short-term price (Holmstrom, 1989).  Manso (2011) proposes a similar argument for
managerial protection as a means of encouraging innovation.  Rather than taking a one-size-fits-all view of ATPs and estimating their average effect on all firms, we explore a setting where such provisions can be beneficial to investors. 3
We use a number of alternative designs to explore the effect of anti-takeover protection on innovative and non-innovative firms.  Our primary research design is to explore the effects of a state law change in Delaware that significantly
increased the takeover costs of firms incorporated there.  Bebchuk and Cohen (2005), Low (2009), and Atanassov (2013)
discuss how the implementation of state law change in Delaware in 1995 made it easier for firms to use certain takeover
defenses such as poison pills to block hostile takeovers.  We examine the effect of this exogenous event on a firm's Tobin's Q. 
Using a difference-in-difference approach, we examine the effect of the regime change on innovative firms incorporated in
Delaware and compare it to the effect on other firms.  We find that after the change in state law, Delaware-based innovative
firms enjoyed a significant improvement in their Tobin's Q compared to both Delaware-based non-innovative firms and
non-Delaware-based innovative firms. 
Given that the state law change was particularly relevant to firms with poison pills and staggered boards in place, we
explore whether its effect is stronger for firms with above-average protection.  Using data obtained from the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC), we partition the sample into protected and unprotected firms using three alternative
measures of takeover protection: presence or absence of poison pills (PPILL), presence or absence of staggered boards (SB)
and above/below median value of the entrenchment index (EINDEX) proposed by Bebchuk Name (2009). 4 Using these three
measures, we compare the effects of the Delaware law change for protected and innovative (PI) firms relative to the other
groups.  We find that Delaware-based PI firms experience a statistically and economically significant improvement in their
Tobin's Q subsequent to the state law change.  This improvement is greater than those experienced by all other Delawarebased firms, including the unprotected and innovative (UPI) firms and the protected and non-innovative (PNI) firms. 
We perform additional analyses using an event study design around the dates on which the court rulings were announced.  The first date is January 11, 1995 when the Supreme Court of Delaware allowed Unitrin Inc.  to use both a poison pill
and share repurchases to fend off a hostile takeover bid from American General Corp.  The second is December 4 1995, when
the U. S.  District Court for the District of Delaware denied Moore Corp.  Ltd. ’s motion against the use of poison pills as an
antitakeover mechanism by Wallace Computer Services Inc.  Using these two dates as our focal points, we examine 2-day
and 4-day cumulative abnormal returns subsequent to the ruling dates for PI and UPI firms.  The results show that PI firms
experience greater cumulative abnormal returns subsequent to the rulings than UPI firms do, and these results are statistically significant for PPILL- and EINDEX-based measures of protection.  In order to rule out the alternative explanation that PI
firms outperform UPI firms in general and not just on the state law change dates, we bootstrap the empirical distribution of
the difference between cumulative abnormal returns of PI and UPI firms around other dates.  Our results do not support the
alternative hypothesis. 
Overall, the results of our tests based on the state law change events are consistent with the idea that takeover protection
can benefit a set of firms, and that markets seem to understand this benefit.  Therefore, while some firm managers can
certainly use takeover protection to reap private benefits, others can use the protection to maximize long-term goals of
shareholders more effectively. 
We conduct additional analyses to compare Tobin's Q of PI and UPI firms in a cross-sectional setting.  Prior to this
comparison, however, we employ a propensity score matching sample methodology to pair PI firms with UPI firms based on
firm characteristics.  This helps to reduce the likelihood that the results of a cross-sectional analysis are driven by other
omitted factors.  We find that PI firms’ Tobin's Q exceeds that of the UPI firms by an economically and statistically significant
level.  This finding further supports our primary finding that ATPs can be beneficial to firms with a long-term focus. 
Our results so far provide evidence that PI firms outperform UPI firms.  We attempt to identify empirical evidence on a
possible mechanism for this.  Stein (1988) suggests that protected firms would be less susceptible to short-term market
pressures, so we explore whether PI firms are less likely than UPI firms to engage in harmful real earnings management
when faced with the pressure to meet or beat analyst forecasts.  Using an aggregate measure of real earnings management
along the lines of Roychoudhury (2006) and Cohen Name (2015), we find that PI firms are less likely than UPI firms to engage
in value-destroying activities, such as cutting investment in R&D and advertising expenditures, or boosting profit through
overproduction, in order to meet or narrowly beat analysts’ earnings expectations. 
Our paper contributes to the existing research in several important ways.  First, we provide empirical evidence that some
firms use takeover protection to enhance performance and that stock market participants understand this benefit and price
these firms accordingly.  This is in contrast to much of the earlier research that explores the average effects of ATPs on all
firms and documents a negative association between ATPs and firm performance.  The finding that ATPs are beneficial for a
group of innovative firms helps explain the persistence of these provisions and provides an explanation for the puzzling
finding that many IPO firms, including ones backed by venture capitalists, either have ATPs in place at the time of the IPO or
institute them soon thereafter. 5 Second, while much of the prior work linking ATPs to firm performance uses either a crosssectional research design or examines an endogenous event (such as management's decision to de-stagger the board), we
use the exogenous event of state law change in Delaware to examine how firm performance is affected by innovation and
pre-existing ATPs.  This setting allows us to address many of the endogeneity concerns that plague the other studies and
provides us with a richer setting to tease out the effect of takeover protection.  Finally, by using multiple measures of ATPs
and by conducting numerous tests using both an event-study approach and a cross-sectional design, we provide a comprehensive body of evidence in support of the beneficial role of ATPs, while reducing the risk that our findings are an artifact
of a particular variable or research design choice. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 discusses the prior literature on the effects of ATPs, Section 3
describes the data, Section 4 discusses the research design and results of the primary tests using state law changes, Section 5
reports the results of additional analyses, Section 6 reports some sensitivity analyses, and Section 7 concludes the paper. 
2.  Literature survey. 
Theoretical literature on takeover defenses provides two longstanding views of the effects of ATPs.  One view, which
stems from the seminal works of Fama (1980), Grossman and Hart (1980) and Jensen (1993), is that managers who are
protected from takeover threats tend to shirk, and to engage in activities that are not necessarily in the best interests of
shareholders; this reduces shareholder wealth and operating efficiency.  Therefore, by removing the takeover threats, ATPs
can lead to management entrenchment and inefficiency.  An alternative view is that takeover pressures can cause management to get overly focused on short-term goals, thereby neglecting projects that yield benefits over the long-term. 
Holmstrom (1989) argues that market pressures can cause management to focus on short-term projects and neglect potentially value-enhancing long-term projects.  Stein (1988) develops a setting in which information asymmetry between
managers and investors about the profitability of innovative long-term projects leads investors to undervalue firms that
make long-term investments, exposing these firms to a greater threat of takeover.  In this setting, the existence of ATPs helps
reduce management's incentive to choose projects that yield quicker returns in the short term.  Shleifer and Vishny (1990)
raise similar concerns about takeover threats tempering innovation and growth.  Finally, Manso (2011) develops an analytical
model showing that some degree of protection of management is helpful in motivating innovation. 
It is significant to note that much of the early empirical work recognizes and discusses the pros and cons of ATPs as
identified in theoretical literature and discussed in this paper.  However, much of the recent work highlights the negative
theoretical underpinnings of ATPs.  Early work addressing this debate includes Linn and McConnell (1983), Jarrell and
Poulsen (1987), Szewczyk and Tsetsekos (1992), and Melbrouek Name (1990).  Using an event study, Linn and McConnell
(1983) find a positive reaction to the adoption of ATPs, while Jarrell and Poulsen (1987) find the announcement of various
antitakeover amendments to have an insignificant effect on share prices, on average.  In an interesting early natural experiment study in this area, Szewczyk and Tsetsekos (1992) find that the passage of a 1990 Pennsylvania Senate bill, which
reduced shareholders’ ability to challenge management through the proxy process, resulted in a decrease in shareholder
value.  However, this study was limited to 56 firms and did not partition firms based on their likelihood of benefiting from
ATPs.  Using a sample of 203 firms, Meulbroek Name (1990) attempt to directly test Stein's (1988) conclusion that ATPs can
reduce myopic behavior.  They find results counter to expectations and consistent with the entrenchment hypothesis. 
More recent studies using bigger samples and longer periods of coverage generally highlight the negative effects of ATPs. 
Gompers Name (2003) document that firms with relatively greater number of ATPs in place have lower firm value and stock
returns.  This is consistent with ATPs reducing the effectiveness of one form of monitoring mechanism, resulting in managerial inefficiencies.  Bebchuk Name (2009) come to similar conclusions using a selected subset of the ATPs reported in the
IRRC.  Focusing on staggered boards only, Bebchuk and Cohen (2005) find a negative association between the presence of
staggered boards and firm value.  It is important to note that all of these studies use a cross-sectional research design and
examine the average effect of ATPs without considering the effects of ATPs across various subgroups. 
One paper that does explore the effects of ATPs across different types of firms is Falaye (2007b).  Like Bebchuk and Cohen
(2005), he uses a cross-sectional approach to examine the effect of staggered boards on firm value (Tobin's Q), and finds a
negative association between the two.  Furthermore, he finds that this negative association continues to hold for firms with
positive R&D.  Using the same research design as Falaye (2007b), we are able to replicate the results in that paper.  However,
the cross-sectional approach suffers from significant endogeneity concerns, which can be addressed by using a natural
experiment (as we do in this paper).  Using the state law change approach significantly alters Faleye's results and conclusions.  Furthermore, given our intent to identify firms that have a longer-term focus than their peers, we use partitions based
on industry-adjusted R&D (rather than positive or negative R&D).
