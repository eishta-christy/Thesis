 
We provide evidence on the effects of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the U. S.  on borrowers’ voluntary disclosure of ﬁrm-speciﬁc information to public ﬁnancial markets.  The past three decades have witnessed waves of consolidations 
through M&As in the U. S.  banking industry.  This trend has signiﬁcantly reduced the number of banking institutions, and a 
few large banks now hold the bulk of assets.  Researchers argue that the consolidation has fundamentally altered the nature 
of banks as ﬁnancial intermediaries, both directly by affecting how banks monitor and ﬁnance borrowers (e. g. , changing the 
type and nature of products and services banks offer), and indirectly by affecting borrowers’ demand for products and services from alternative (public) ﬁnancial markets.  Evidence on how bank mergers affect borrowers’ disclosure adds to our 
understanding of their consequences, and contributes to the growing literature that seeks to understand how ﬁrms’ incentive to produce and disseminate public information is affected by various institutional mechanisms in a country’s ﬁnancial 
markets (e. g. , Ball Name, 20 0 0; Leuz Name, 2003; Bushman Name, 2004 ).  Furthermore, to the extent that public information 
is a key determinant of the development of stock markets, such evidence can shed light on the interaction between public 
stock markets and bank markets ( Allen and Gale, 20 0 0; Levine, 2005 ).  
We posit that bank mergers affect borrowers’ incentive to disclose information publicly by affecting the monitoring and 
ﬁnancing services provided by banks.  Prior work, however, has not reached consensus on the speciﬁc nature and degree 
of the monitoring and ﬁnancing effects of bank mergers, especially for publicly listed borrowers.  Therefore, whether bank 
mergers can cause economically meaningful public information spillover through increased disclosure by borrowers is ex 
ante unclear and ultimately an empirical question.  
On the monitoring side, mergers can change borrowers’ disclosure incentives by changing the nature and extent of bank 
monitoring.  Traditional banking literature emphasizes the unique role played by banks because of their ability to produce 
soft, private information about their borrowers.  This ability allows banks to serve as delegated monitors for public capital 
providers who ﬁnd it diﬃcult to monitor ﬁrms for which much of the information is soft (e. g. , Diamond, 1984, 1991; Fama, 
1985 ).  Following bank mergers, borrowers’ incentive to disclose may increase or decrease depending on how mergers affect 
bank monitoring.  On one hand, mergers can alter the nature of bank monitoring from being more soft information based to 
being more hard information based, as mergers create more complex and hierarchical organizations that are less effective 
at collecting and processing soft information but may be more eﬃcient at processing hard information (e. g. , Stein, 2002; 
Berger Name, 2005 ).  This can lead to increased public disclosure by borrowers for two reasons.  First, merged banks themselves may rely more on hard information that can be eﬃciently collected through public disclosures ( Gormley Name, 2012 ).  
Second, to the extent that banks’ comparative advantage in monitoring primarily emanates from their ability to process soft 
information, public capital providers may rely less on bank monitoring after mergers and instead demand additional public 
disclosure to facilitate their own monitoring efforts.  On the other hand, to the extent that mergers discipline banks plagued 
by agency problems, monitoring effort may increase at banks that did not suﬃciently monitor their borrowers prior to the 
mergers.  This may increase the willingness of public capital providers to delegate the monitoring role to banks, reducing 
the public capital providers’ demand for public disclosure.  
On the ﬁnancing side, borrowers’ disclosure can change if mergers affect their access to bank credit.  Bank mergers are 
often motivated by eﬃciency gain considerations, and banks take actions and make changes in their operations to realize 
these gains.  While these changes may beneﬁt the merging banks, they are not necessarily welfare improving to all borrowers 
( Karceski Name, 2005; Berger Name, 1999; DeYoung Name, 2009 ).  Some borrowers may be adversely affected by these changes 
and might experience reduced credit availability.  For example, the merged entity may re-balance and re-optimize their portfolios to achieve better risk management.  When merged banks have signiﬁcant geographic overlap, they may reduce loans 
to some existing borrowers to reduce their exposure to the local area ( Amore Name, 2013 ).  Or, following the disciplinary 
acquisition of a poorly run bank, the merged entity may cut lending to borrowers who were beneﬁtting from ineﬃciently 
priced cheap loans from the acquired bank.  Reduced credit availability might prompt these borrowers to increase public 
disclosure to improve their access to alternative ﬁnancing sources ( Diamond and Verrecchia, 1991; Baiman and Verrecchia, 
1996 ).  At the same time, these changes may also beneﬁt some borrowers whose disclosure may decrease or remain unchanged.  Therefore, whether bank mergers can cause any meaningful public information spillover via the ﬁnancing channel 
is also an empirical question. 
Our analysis is based on a comprehensive sample of nearly 13,0 0 0 syndicated loan contracts where the lead lenders 
are commercial banks or bank holding companies and the borrowers are publicly traded companies in the U. S.  exchanges 
with ongoing lending relationships with their banks.  We use a difference-in-differences (DiD) design in which we compare 
changes in the disclosure of borrowers whose banks are involved in M&As during their contract periods to contemporaneous 
changes in the disclosure of borrowers whose banks are not involved in M&As.  
Using the incidence of conference calls as our main measure of disclosure, we ﬁnd that borrowers signiﬁcantly increase 
disclosure after their lending banks engage in M&As.  The disclosure increases are not concentrated in periods immediately 
after mergers; instead, they persist throughout post-merger periods.  These effects are robust to the inclusion of controls for 
known determinants of disclosure and to alternative measures of disclosure based on earnings forecasts.  
In cross-sectional analyses, we ﬁnd that the effects of bank mergers are stronger for borrowers who are more vulnerable 
to disruptions in banking services following mergers.  Speciﬁcally, the disclosure increases are larger for borrowers who are 
more reliant on the merging banks to ﬁnance their assets and who do not have alternative existing banking relationships.  
Consistent with the monitoring channel, we also ﬁnd that disclosure increases are larger when banks perform a stronger 
monitoring role (as proxied by the number of covenants in the borrowers’ existing covenants), when information about 
borrowers’ operations tends to be soft (as proxied by a composite score based on borrowers’ intangible assets and R&D 
expenditure), and when their banks’ pre-merger organizational structures are more suitable for soft-information monitoring 
(as proxied by the number of branches operated by the banks).  Finally, consistent with the ﬁnancing channel, we ﬁnd that 
the effects of mergers are stronger for borrowers when the merging banks have more correlated geographic exposures and 
thus are more likely to cut lending to their existing borrowers for risk diversiﬁcation purposes.  
We examine the sensitivity of our results to two alternative explanations.  The ﬁrst one is that changes in local economic 
conditions coinciding with bank mergers could be driving our results.  We conduct three analyses to address this concern.  
First, we show that our ﬁndings are robust to the inclusion of a comprehensive set of controls for location-level economic 
conditions.  Second, we ﬁnd that our results are robust to the inclusion of state-year or MSA-year interactive dummies that 
ﬂexibly absorb the effect of any time-varying local-level economic shocks.  Finally, our ﬁndings are also robust to estimating 
the DiD speciﬁcation on a propensity score matched sample in which each treatment borrower (affected by bank mergers) is 
matched to an economically similar control borrower (unaffected by bank mergers) from the same location.  These ﬁndings 
suggest that the disclosure increase is unlikely to be driven by changes in local economic conditions.  A second alternative 
explanation is that our results reﬂect the effect of poor ﬁnancial health of banks engaged in mergers.  We note that prior 
studies show that bank mergers in the U. S.  have largely been driven by regulatory, technological, and competitive changes, 
and most mergers involved healthy ﬁnancial institutions ( Pilloff, 2004 ).  In addition, we ﬁnd that the disclosure increase does 
not vary with proxies for bank performance and also manifests when banks are in good health prior to mergers.  
We also document two ﬁndings consistent with the premise that bank mergers cause disruptions in borrowers’ banking 
service.  First, we ﬁnd that relative to borrowers whose banks did not engage in M&A activities, borrowers of merged banks 
reduce their reliance on bank credit and increase their reliance on public bond ﬁnancing following mergers.  Second, we 
document signiﬁcant negative stock price reactions to borrowers upon the announcement of their bank mergers.  Collectively, 
these ﬁndings are consistent with the interpretation that the disclosure increase reﬂects borrowers’ response to disruptions 
in banking services caused by mergers at their existing lending banks.
