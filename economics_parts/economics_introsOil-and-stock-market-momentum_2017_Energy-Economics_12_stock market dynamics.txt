Stock market anomalies reﬂect inefﬁciencies in the way information
is disseminated in the market place and reﬂected in asset prices via
investors' trades.  Anomalies also provide the basis for active investment
strategies that aim to generate abnormal proﬁts.  One of the widely
examined anomalies that has been shown to persist in stock markets
is the momentum anomaly which relates to the relationship between
a stock's historical and subsequent performance (e. g.  Asness, 1994. 
Carhart, 1997.  Moskowitz and Grinblatt, 1999.  Jegadeesh and Titman,
1993, 2001).  An important implication of this anomaly is an investment
strategy called momentum investing that is based on buying past
winner stocks and selling past loser stocks.  Thus, apart from being a
matter of concern from an academic perspective, the presence of this
anomaly has signiﬁcant investment implications as well. 
In another popular strand of the literature, numerous studies have
explored the effect of oil market dynamics on stock return and volatility. 
Oil can affect stock market dynamics via a number of different channels. 
At the ﬁrm level, oil price can affect costs and growth expectations,
which then affect stock values.
