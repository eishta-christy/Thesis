Vehicles are a major source of pollution in most countries.  In
Canada, for instance, light duty vehicles generated 82 million tonnes
of greenhouse gases, approximately 12% of the country’s total emissions (Canada, 2015).  Vehicles also produce other pollutants that
adversely affect human health and well-being.  These including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter among others. 
Pollution from cars and trucks is often viewed as the archetypal
economic externality.  the costs associated with emissions accrue
to society but are not fully borne privately by drivers.  Reducing transportation-related gasoline consumption has, unsurprisingly,
become a focus of policy makers. 
An expanding array of policies have targeted vehicular emissions in Canada (Antweiler and Gulati, 2013).  Several provinces
have offered rebates for the purchase of fuel eﬃcient vehicles such
as hybrid-electric or electric vehicles (Chandra, 2010).  Ontario and
the federal government used a system of taxes and rebates based
on fuel economy (Rivers Name, 2017.  Sallee and Slemrod, 2012). 
British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec apply a carbon price
as a disincentive on the consumption of fossil fuels (Antweiler
and Gulati, 2016.  Rivers Name, 2015), and similar carbon prices
are required across all provinces by 2018 under the Pan-Canadian
Framework on Green Growth and Climate Change.  The federal government has provided a tax credit to encourage commuting by
public transport rather than private vehicle (Rivers and Plumptre,
2016.  Chandler, 2014) and recently adopted new vehicle greenhouse gas intensity regulations requiring manufacturers to achieve
speciﬁc targets for ﬂeet-wide emissions per kilometre. 1 The optimal stringency of each of these programs depends, at least to some
degree, on the responsiveness of the fuel economy of vehicles to the
price of gasoline.  Policy makers therefore require reliable estimates
of key elasticities relating to the choice of and use of the vehicle
stock in response to gasoline prices and other policies.  Yet, despite
the breadth of attempts to address externalities from automobile
usage, little is known about how gasoline prices actually inﬂuence consumer decision-making with respect to new vehicle fuel
economy. 
We estimate the elasticity of new vehicle fuel eﬃciency with
respect to gasoline price by exploiting a rich dataset covering
gasoline prices, vehicle registrations, vehicle fuel economy, and
demographic variables at the neighborhood level in 42 Canadian
cities from 2000 to 2010.  Our data and econometric models enable us
to credibly control for unobserved time-varying and cross-sectional
variables that may otherwise bias estimates of the elasticity.  Our
main ﬁnding is that a 1% increase in gasoline prices leads to a 0. 08%
improvement in the fuel economy of new vehicles.  This elasticity is
slightly smaller (in absolute value) than previous estimates, suggesting that consumers may be less responsive to gasoline prices than
previously thought. 
Having established this main result, we proceed to show that
the responsiveness to gasoline prices is greater in more urbanized
regions compared to less urban regions.  In particular, we use four
proxies for the level of urbanization in each of the neighborhoods in
our data set.  (1) the distance to the urban core (more “urban” neighborhoods are closer to the urban core).  (2) the population density
(more “urban” neighborhoods have higher population densities).  (3)
the mode share of public transit (more “urban” neighborhoods have
a higher mode share of commuting by public transit).  and (4) city
population (more “urban” cities are larger).  We interact each of these
proxies with the gasoline price variable in our main regression and
ﬁnd stronger responses to increased gasoline prices in more “urban”
areas, which are robust to our classiﬁcation of “urbanization”.  While
we lack the data to explore the mechanisms behind this differential response, the ﬁnding that vehicle choice in more urban areas is
more sensitive to gasoline prices than in peri-urban areas is novel
and interesting on its own. 
Finally, we demonstrate another important result, similar to
one that has been found in a range of recent work.  consumers
are more responsive to changes in excise taxes than to equivalent changes in gasoline prices due to other factors.  This larger
responsiveness to changes in taxes has been noted in several papers
focused on gasoline demand (Rivers Name, 2015.  Li Name, 2014. 
Scott, 2015.  Lawley and Thivierge, 2018) and, more recently, in
another Canadian study by Antweiler and Gulati (2016) on vehicle
choices.  Our results suggest that consumers respond to a change
in excise taxes by improving fuel eﬃciency four to ten times
as much as to an equivalent change in tax-exclusive prices.  This
has important implications for policy makers considering using
excise taxes as a way to encourage more fuel eﬃcient vehicle
choices. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2
presents our conceptual framework and offers a review of similar
studies.  Section 3 explains the data and empirical strategy.  The main
results are presented in Section 4, while the heterogeneity of these
estimates is investigated in Section 5.  Section 6 concludes. 
2.  Conceptual framework. 
Vehicle gasoline consumption can be decomposed as the product
of three factors. 2 Denote the fuel eﬃciency of the on-road vehicle
stock—i. e. , the number of litres required to travel a kilometre—with
F.  Consumers consider the price of gasoline when selecting the fuel
eﬃciency of vehicles, so F is a function of the price of gasoline, p.  The
second factor is vehicle utilization, D—i. e. , the number of kilometres
travelled per vehicle.  Conditional on the fuel consumption rating
of the vehicle as well as the price for gasoline consumers choose
the distance to drive.  Thus, this second factor, D, the intensity of
vehicle use, is a function of both the price of gasoline, p, as well
as fuel eﬃciency, F.  Finally, V(p) is the total number of vehicles in
the ﬂeet, also a function of the price of gasoline.  Combining these
three factors allows us to write a reduced-form expression for total
gasoline consumption. 
Taking the total derivative of this expression yields a decomposition for the short-run elasticity of gasoline demand with respect
to price that is comprised of distinct moving parts.  the change in
ﬂeet fuel economy with respect to gasoline price, the change in distance travelled with respect to gasoline price, the change in ﬂeet size
with respect to gasoline price and the change in distance travelled
with respect to ﬂeet fuel economy.  Referring to this elasticity as 4, weThere are four parameters in this expression.  First, g is the elasticity of vehicle fuel eﬃciency with respect to gasoline
price, and V is the elasticity of aggregate vehicle stock with
respect to gasoline prices.  These elasticities, respectively, show the
percent change in the per vehicle gasoline demand and the percent
change in the number of vehicles in the ﬂeet that result from a 1%
increase in gasoline prices.  The next two components are D , the elasticities of distance driven with respect to fuel
economy and gasoline price. 4 The product g(1 + h) describes the
interaction between changes in ﬂeet fuel economy and distance travelled, with the term in brackets often referred to as the “rebound
effect”.  Rebound effects arise from the feedback between vehicles’
fuel eﬃciency and the cost of driving – namely, increases in ﬂeet fuel
economy may result in additional driving demand by reducing the
private cost of driving (Borenstein, 2013.  Sorrell and Dimitropoulos,
2008.  Chan and Gillingham, 2015). 
Each of these key elasticities helps to determine the overall
change in gasoline consumption in response to a change in gasoline
price or other similar policy.  Several studies exist that estimate l. 
For example, Gillingham (2014), Gillingham Name (2015) and Greene
Name (1999) estimate the elasticity of vehicle miles travelled with
respect to gasoline price in the US, l.  The consensus value is approximately −0. 2.  Using aggregate data, Barla Name (2009) ﬁnd virtually
identical estimates for Canada, while Moshiri and Kamil (2017) ﬁnd
a value of −0. 12, or roughly half, using Canadian micro data. 
This paper’s focuses is on estimating g, the elasticity of ﬂeet fuel
economy with respect to gasoline price (since we do not observe
actual driving behavior in the data for this paper, we have no way of
estimating h or l).  There are a handful of estimates for g, although
few in Canada.  Li Name (2009) use detailed US vehicle registration
data from 1997 to 2005 to determine how changes in gasoline prices
affect the fuel economy of vehicle sales.  They ﬁnd that a 1% increase
in gasoline prices causes an improvement in ﬂeet fuel economy of
0. 2%.  Klier and Linn (2010) identify changes in US fuel economy from
monthly vehicle sales.  They ﬁnd that a 1% change in gasoline price
results in about a 0. 1% improvement in fuel economy.  Burke and
Nishitateno (2013) use cross-sectional aggregate data from 43 countries to estimate the relationship between new vehicle fuel economy
and gasoline price.  They ﬁnd an elasticity of about −0. 2. 5 It is not
obvious how much policy-makers should trust many older estimates
of g, however.  Often strong assumptions were needed to identify
the effect of gasoline prices on fuel eﬃciency of new vehicle purchases (Klier and Linn, 2010).  In cross-sectional studies, such as West
(2004), a maintained assumption is that there is no relationship
between gasoline prices and unobserved consumer preferences, an
assumption that is violated, for example, if consumers engaged in
residential sorting based on gasoline prices or if unobserved consumer preferences are an important determinant of gasoline taxes
(Hammar Name, 2004).  Other studies based on country-, state-, or
province-level panel data, such as Barla Name (2009), Burke and
Nishitateno (2013), andSmall and Dender (2007), use the panel
structure of the data to control for time-invariant unobservables. 
While a signiﬁcant improvement on earlier cross-section analysis,
the level of aggregation of these analysis prevent them from exploring geographic heterogeneity in responses.  Moreover, because they
have fewer observations (because they are based on aggregate data),
estimates are often less precise. 
Klier and Linn (2010) and Li Name (2009) made signiﬁcant progress
by using detailed micro-datasets to relax key identifying assumptions and to provide credible causal estimates of the elasticity of
vehicle fuel economy with respect to gasoline price.  We build on this
research in two ways.  First, we estimate the elasticity in a Canadian
context.  Consumer behavior may differ between Canada and the US,
especially as the structure of the two countries’ macroeconomies
differs.  Second, we probe various forms of heterogeneity, especially
related to the characteristics of urban centres, and different components of gasoline prices – i. e. , taxes versus market ﬂuctuations –
inﬂuence consumer decisions.  With the exception of Antweiler and
Gulati (2016), no previous study, to the best of our knowledge, has
investigated these channels. 
<Middle> Data and empirical strategy. 
3. 1.  Dataset construction and summary statistics. 
We aim to estimate the elasticity of new vehicle fuel economy
with respect to the gasoline price.  Several data sources are combined for the analysis.  First, we obtain data on individual vehicle
registrations. 6 This database covers the universe of passenger vehicles registered in all Canadian provinces from 2000 to 2010.  Vehicles
are categorized by make (e. g. , Toyota), model (e. g. , Camry), series
(e. g. , XLE), model year, engine size, number of engine cylinders,
transmission type and fuel type.  A vehicle i is deﬁned as a unique
combination of vehicle year, make, model, series, engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel type.  Thus, for example, a 2006 Toyota
Camry LE 4-cylinder 2. 0 L gasoline car is considered a “vehicle” in
the dataset, while a 2006 Toyota Camry XLE 4-cylinder 2. 4 L gasoline car is a distinct vehicle.  Registrations are recorded according to
the forward sortation area (FSA) of the home address of the vehicle
registrant. 7 Each observation corresponds to a unique combination
of FSA-vehicle-year and reﬂects the number of registrations of each
type of vehicle in each FSA in each year.  We focus on new vehicle
purchases rather than the total stock of registered vehicles, so only
retain new vehicles. 
The vehicle registration data do not include vehicle-speciﬁc fuel
economy, so we use information from Natural Resources Canada
(NRCan) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to obtain
vehicle-year fuel economy ratings.  Every year, both agencies issue
information on the rated city and highway fuel consumption for virtually all new vehicles according to their characteristics (i. e. , make,
model, model year, series, engine size, etc. ).  Regression-based imputation methods are applied to match fuel economy ratings to vehicles
in the dataset.  For each fuel economy rating dataset (EPA and NRCan),
vehicle fuel economy is imputed via two alternative models.  Model
one predicts fuel economy based on main vehicle effects (e. g. , make,
model, engine size), while model two predicts fuel economy using
an expanded speciﬁcation including both main effects and the interactions between variables (e. g. , make, engine size, make × engine
size).  These imputations are referred to as NRCan1, NRCan2, EPA1,
and EPA2, depending on (a) the fuel consumption dataset and (b) the
imputation model.  Our preferred speciﬁcations use the EPA2 model
(i. e. , use the EPA fuel economy rating and the imputation model with
interactions), but we include all four permutations for robustness. 9
These models yield accurate predictions for vehicle fuel economy
and explain the majority of the variation in rated fuel consumption. 
R2 values range from 0. 77 to 0. 94 depending on the speciﬁcation.  The
appendix contains additional description of this imputation and itsGasoline prices for 42 Canadian cities are collected from MJ
Ervin/Kent Marketing Services, based on a weekly survey of over
700 gasoline stations located throughout each city. 10 A city-speciﬁc
sales-weighted average annual price series is constructed.  Information on gasoline taxes, which we use in our analysis, is also included
with these data.  Population, median income and other demographics are from a summary of the T1 tax ﬁler data released by the
Canada Revenue Agency and supplied by Statistics Canada.  These
data provide annual description of the populations in each FSA inGasoline prices for 42 Canadian cities are collected from MJ

with these data.  Population, median income and other demographics
are from a summary of the T1 tax filer data released by the
Canada Revenue Agency and supplied by Statistics Canada.  These
data provide annual description of the populations in each FSA inThese disparate data sources are combined as follows.  The vehicle
data record the number of new vehicle registrations of vehicle i
in FSA f in year t.  We refer to these FSA-vehicle-year registrations as
Rift.  The imputed fuel economy rating of each unique vehicle i in the
registration dataset is referred to as ˆFi.  A unique ˆFi is assigned according
to each of the four imputation permutations (i. e. , the NRCan
and EPA series and the two models).  Average fleet fuel efficiency of
all newly registered vehicles by FSA is then calculated as follows is our dependent variable on which we regress
gasoline prices (plus controls). 
Fig.  1 plots the trends in sales-weighted fleet fuel efficiency ratings
for cars, trucks and all vehicles.  Clear differences between the
NRCan and EPA ratings are apparent.  This is expected and a feature
of the rating methodologies.  NRCan updated its rating methodology
in 2015 to improve the match between rated fuel economy and
on-road fuel economy, but our data uses the older methodology as
this is the information that would be available to consumers at the
time. 11 Despite differences in levels between the NRCan and EPA ratings,
trends are similar across the two series, likewise the trends for
the different imputation models are similar.  As mentioned analysis
is conducted using all four permutations.  Fig.  1 shows the improvement
in vehicle fuel efficiency over the decade, with a gain in roughly
1 L per 100 km between 2000 and 2010. 
As a next step, the FSA-level average fuel consumption ratings
are matched with real gasoline prices for each city c in year t. 12 To
do this, a concordance is established between FSAs f and cities c, by
taking the centroid of each city and each FSA.  By determining the
distance between each centroid pair, gasoline prices from city c are
assigned to FSA f as long as two criteria are satisfied.  First, city c must
be the closest city to FSA f in the dataset and city c must be within
30 km from the centroid of FSA f.  Beyond 30 km, we judge that gasoline
prices in city c will not be the same as in FSA f.  Since the gasoline
price data are only available in urban areas, our data set includes only
FSAs that are proximate (within 30 km) to urban areas.  This means
that our second criterion implies that we do not work with the entire
set of Canadian FSAs.  Instead we use those 900 FSAs that are within
the pre-specified radius of 42 cities for which price data are available. 
The complete set of matched FSA-city pairs is shown via the map inThe final step of dataset assembly involves mapping gasoline
prices in city c to each FSA within city c for each year t.  Gasoline prices
in each of the cities share a common trend, but there is distinct variation
over time and between cities. We use the within-city variation
in gasoline prices, after conditioning on year and city fixed effects,
to identify our main coefficients on the effect of gasoline prices on
vehicle fuel economy. 
Table 1 presents summary statistics.  The final dataset includes
900 FSAs across 42 cities from years 2000 to 2010.  In total, there
are approximately 8600 complete observations as gasoline price data
are missing for about 1% of observations.  The mean fuel efficiency
rating methodologies for the four approaches are comparable and
range from 10. 1 L/100 km to 11. 5 L/100 km.  The average number of
vehicles registered in a FSA-year equals 778, but ranges from 1 to
24,547.  Average gasoline prices are 82. 6 c/L inclusive of the average
tax which is equal to 14. 0 c/L.  Finally, the average distance between
city and FSA centroids is 11. 8 km, but spans from 0. 2 km to 30 km. 
3. 2.  Primary econometric specification. 
Our objective is to quantify the influence of gasoline price on the
fuel economy of new vehicles.  We do this by exploiting within-city
variation in gasoline prices, so our main specification is F. 
ft is the imputed fuel economy of the new vehicle fleet in FSA
f in year t.  It is important to note that ˆFft is an imputed variable
(as described above) and is therefore measured with error.  Given
the methods described in the appendix, it is reasonable to assume
that the measurement error is classical, so we obtain less precise,
but unbiased, coefficient estimates.  gaspriceft is the price of gasoline
in cents per litre.  Our preferred specification takes the logarithms
of these two variables, such that it is possible to interpret b1 as
the elasticity of new vehicle fuel consumption with respect to gasoline
price.  As we discuss later on, consumer choices of vehicle fuel
economy depend on expectations of future fuel prices, which we do
not observe.  We thus interpret our elasticity as a short-run elasticity
of fuel economy with respect to gasoline price. 13 X represents
additional covariates (described below), while dt and kf are fixed
effects for years and FSAs, respectively.  dt controls for time-invariant
changes in vehicle fuel economy that may be due to, say, federal
trade agreements, while kf captures time-invariant unobservable
factors that are unique to a specific FSA (e. g. , geography).  Including
kf means that identification is based on within-FSA variation in gasoline
price.  4ft is the error term.  We cluster standard errors on FSAs to
accommodate arbitrary temporal correlation in the data. 
4.  Main results.  effect of gasoline prices on new vehicle fuel
economy. 
This section presents results from our primary speciﬁcations. 
Section 5 explores important sources of heterogeneity including
the role of vehicle type and the differential effect of tax variation
compared with market-based variation in prices. 
Table 2 has four columns of results using the fuel economy rating
imputed from the EPA rating system with the full model including
interactions (i. e. , EPA2).  The identifying variation is altered in each
speciﬁcations by including and excluding ﬁxed effects.  The ﬁrst column is a naive model which pools the data (excludes all ﬁxed effects). 
Identiﬁcation is from variation over the combined changes between
regions and over time.  Column (1), for this naive model, shows an
elasticity of new vehicle fuel economy rating with respect to the
gasoline price of −0. 22.  This elasticity is comparable to others in
the literature such as those in Small and Dender (2007) and Li et al. Despite the similarity between the naive model and prior estimates, unobserved factors, such as the geographic attributes of the
region, might be correlated with both gasoline prices and the new
vehicle purchase decisions.  These confounders may potentially bias
our estimates from the naive model.  To address this, we include
ﬁxed effects for both time and geography in subsequent columns
of the table.  Column (2) includes FSA ﬁxed effects and shows an
elasticity of −0. 15.  An elasticity of −0. 40 is presented in the third
column with only time ﬁxed effects.  Both time and FSA ﬁxed effects
are included in column (4), our preferred regression.  We ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant and economically meaningful elasticity of new
vehicle fuel economy with respect to gasoline price equal to −0. 08,
value that is meaningfully smaller (in absolute value) than the
−0. 22 from column (1).  The elasticity in our preferred specification,
column (4), suggests that a 1% increase in gasoline prices leads to a
0. 08% improvement in average new vehicle fleet fuel economy after
controlling for unobservable factors that are invariant to the FSA andTable 3 explores the sensitivity of column (4) from Table 2 to the
different measures of fuel efficiency and imputation method.  There
are four columns in Table 3.  In each column, we report the results
of a regression of the log of rated fuel consumption (in litres per
100 km) on the log of gasoline price, the log of median income and
both FSA and year fixed effects for both year and forward sortation
area.  The first two columns use the fuel consumption ratings
from NRCan – NRCan1 and NRCan2, respectively – while the third
and fourth columns use the fuel economy ratings from the EPA –
EPA1 and EPA2 (i. e. , this latter model is identical to column (4) from
Table 2).  Columns (1) and (3) use imputed fuel economy ratings from
the more parsimonious model in which only the main effects for
each vehicle characteristic are used to assign fuel economy ratings. 
Columns (2) and (4) use the model with fully saturated interactions
between main effects to increase the predictive power of the fuel
economy models.  Overall, the effects of fuel rating and imputation
methodologies are small.  Comparing point estimates across columns
reveals very similar elasticities.  In particular, each model implies that
the elasticity of rated fuel consumption of new vehicles with respect
to gasoline price is between −0. 08 and −0. 09, with each being statistically
significant at the 1% level.  The coefficients suggest that a
10% increase in gasoline price leads to a 0. 8 to 0. 9% improvement in
the fuel economy rating of the new vehicle fleet, elasticities that are
smaller (in absolute value) than those found in the comparable naiveThese elasticities warrant several comments.  To start, they are
in the range of others in the literature but are more precise.  Using
aggregate Canadian data at the provincial level from 1990 to 2004,
Barla Name (2009) estimate that the elasticity of fleet fuel economy
with respect to gasoline price is −0. 12 in the long run, while,
for the US, Small and Dender (2007) find an elasticity of −0. 20. 
Li Name (2009), using household level data, also obtain a value of
−0. 20.  Two conclusions can be inferred.  First, our estimate, using
rich city-level data, produces values of comparable magnitude to
estimates using more aggregated information.  Nonetheless, our values
are attenuated slightly and we believe that our method yields
more credible identification.  This suggests that policy makers should
be conservative in their projections of the effect of increased (or
decreased) gasoline prices on consumer decisions to purchase a more
fuel efficient vehicle.  Second, the evidence appears to indicate that
the elasticity of fleet fuel economy with respect to gasoline price is
lower (in absolute value) in Canada compared to the US.  Canadians
appear to be less sensitive to gasoline prices than Americans.  Two
potential explanations are that gasoline prices in Canada are higher,
so Canadians have already made low-cost fuel economy investments. 
Alternatively, the structure of Canada’s economy is more resource
focused.  This sector may require specific classes of vehicles that have
fewer opportunities for substitution. 
Tables 2 and 3 also show that our results are mixed with respect
to the relationship between rated fuel economy and income.  Our
preferred specification (column (4) of Tables 2 and 3) shows a 1%
increase in income causes a 0. 01% improvement in rated fuel economy. 
However, this estimate is sensitive to changes in both the fuel
efficiency rating methodology and the source of identifying variation. 
Using aggregate data, neither Barla Name (2009) nor Small and Dender
(2007) found a statistically significant relationship between income
and vehicle stock fuel economy, so our results accord with theirs. 
A series of robustness checks are contained in the appendix Table
B. 8.  To buttress the coefficients reported in Tables 2 and 3, we include
FSA-by-year time trends, a suite of additional demographic variables
(i. e. , average age, proportion of females, proportion of married individuals
and proportion of individuals living in apartments for each
FSA-year combination) and adopt a different unit of clustering for the
standard errors.  Each specification yields results that are very similar
to our preferred specification. 
5.  Heterogeneity in the effect of gasoline prices on new vehicle
fuel economy. 
The preceding analysis presents the main policy take-away from
our analysis.  a 10% increase gasoline prices leads to an increase the
average fuel economy of the new vehicle ﬂeet of 0. 8%.
