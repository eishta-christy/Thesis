 1.  Introduction The trade-off between risk and return is a fundamental issue in asset pricing theory, which has been given much attention by researchers, market investors and analysts.  In general, investors require a larger expected return from a security that is riskier.  However, after decades of controversy, no consensus exists among researchers on the relation between risk and return across time.  Recently, the volatility implied from options prices is commonly considered as the best volatility forecast and risk measure (Mencia and Sentana, 2013).  Thus, interest in the relations between return and implied volatility has increased to provide new evidence to this debate.  During the 2008 global ﬁnancial crisis, a new implied volatility index (OVX) in the crude oil market was launched by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).  the index can measure the market's expectation of the 30-day volatility of crude oil prices by applying the well-known CBOE Volatility Index methodology to options on the United States Oil Fund (Liu et al. , 2013).  This index is the ﬁrst commodity-based implied volatility index.  research on its relations with oil price returns will help investors further improve their trading decisions and will contribute, as well, to the development of energy ﬁnance, which is what the current study hopes to achieve.  Previous empirical literature has been focused on the relations between returns and historical volatility in ﬁnancial markets (Leὁn et al.
