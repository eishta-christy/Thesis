There is no general consensus among policy makers, development
practitioners and academicians on how to disseminate goods that have
both private and public beneﬁts if the markets fail to generate a substantial penetration of the product (Bensch and Peters, 2012).  One example
which this paper has focused is clean and energy efﬁcient technologies
such as the improved cookstoves (ICS).  Improved stoves are stoves that
are designed to improve energy efﬁciency, remove smoke from the

indoor living space, or lessen the drudgery of cooking duties (Köhlin
Name, 2011).  Energy efﬁcient technologies are technologies or appliances
that reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services.  Despite the health, economic and climate beneﬁt of improved
cookstoves, demand for them is surprisingly low in the rural areas of
many less-developed countries.  Most nongovernmental organizations
that are involved in the dissemination of improved stoves reject the option of distributing them for free (Martin Name, 2011), while others argued that if liquidity and credit constrained people have high valuation
for an item, it is more likely that these people will use goods/items that
are distributed with subsidy. 
Screening and sunk cost effects are two concepts that are related to
peoples' valuation of a product, the price they pay, and usage of the product.  The screening effect is observed when households with a higher
willingness to pay are also more likely to use the product, while the
sunk cost effect occurs when people who paid a higher price for an
item are more likely to use it, i. e. , if an investment has already been
made, people are more likely to use it because they don't want to appear
wasteful. 
In this paper, using a randomized experiment in rural Ethiopia, we
studied whether price incentives (sunk cost and screening effects)
matter for the waiting time to start using the improved stove.  The
study is based on free distribution of improved stoves to 150 households
in six villages and 150 households from six other villages that paid
a positive price.  Among households that paid a positive price, their
willingness to pay (WTP), or valuation of the stove, was tested using
the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak bidding method (Becker Name, 1964). 
When we compare those who received the stove for free with those
who paid for it, we ﬁnd no evidence of a sunk cost effect.  However,
the screening or valuation effect, measured as WTP, is signiﬁcant. 
The previous empirical evidences on these effects are inconsistent. 
Arkes and Blumer (1985) tested whether higher prices (higher sunk
cost) lead to higher usage of a product or a theater ticket.  The authors
found that those who paid the regular price for the ticket used the tickets
more often than those with a discounted price.  Similarly, Moon (2001)
ﬁnd that the higher the sunk costs, the greater the willingness of the decision maker to invest further.  Though the above empirical evidence is in
other contexts, they suggest positive relationship between price paid andAshraf Name (2010) do not ﬁnd an evidence of a sunk cost effect in
Zambia in the use of a water puriﬁcation product but they ﬁnd an
evidence for the screening effect.  Bensch and Peters (2012), studying a
free distribution of improved cookstoves in Senegal found a high rate
of usage of the technology.  Beyene Name (2015) also found a high rate
of usage of the freely distributed improved stove in rural Ethiopia. 
Tarozzi Name (2014) tested existence of a sunk cost effect in using malaria
bed nets, compared those that are freely distribution and those with a
positive price.  They ﬁnd that those who received the nets for free use it
even more intensively than those who paid a positive price.  Cohen and
Dupas (2010) also studying malaria bed nets do not ﬁnd a difference in
adoption behavior between households who a paid price and those
who got it for free.  These ﬁndings weigh against the concept of sunk
cost effect and also against the belief of non-government organizations
that usage intensity increases if people pay a positive price. 
This is not the ﬁrst paper to test the sunk cost and screening effects on
the use of products.  However, the existing empirical results are inconsistent.  Further, to the best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst paper to test both
sunk cost and screening effects on the timing of use of an energy efﬁcient
technology that has environmental, climate and welfare beneﬁts.  In relation to energy efﬁcient technologies, papers which are very close to this
paper are Bensch and Peters (2012) and Beyene Name (2015).  Bensch and
Peters (2012) considers only the effect of free distribution and Beyene
Name (2015) do not also consider the screening effect. 
The rest of paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 introduces the experimental design and procedure.  In section three, we provide empirical
strategy of our study.  Sections 4 and 5 present the data.  Descriptive
statistics and econometric results, respectively.  Finally, the last section
concludes. 
<Middle> Experimental setting and design. 
2. 1.  Experiment setting. 
The experiment was conducted in the southern Tigrai region of
Ethiopia.  The region contains “Dega”, “Weynadega” and “Kola” agroecological zones. 1 These are the major agro-ecological conditions of the
country.  In some areas in these zones, households have relatively high
fuelwood access while other have low access.  In the areas with low access to fuel wood, households have to travel on average around 30 km
to collect fuel wood, but only 6 km in areas with relatively high fuel
wood access. 2 This climate and forest setting is suitable for the stove purchase experiment because the demand for stoves may vary depending
on the weather and access to fuel wood. 
A total of 300 households were randomly selected to participate in a
stove purchase experiment from six villages that represent the different
weather and forest conditions (here after called as purchase villages). 
Another 300 households were also selected from six other villages for
a free distribution of stoves (here after called free distribution villages). 
The type of improved stove used in this experiment is called the “mirt”
stove.  This is an energy efﬁcient stove that is used for baking Injera, a
pancake like thin bread that is the Ethiopian staple food.  The stove is
also designed to cook soup, boil water, make coffee, etc.  while baking
Injera without the use of additional fuel. 
The stove purchase experiment was conducted using BeckerDeGroot-Marschak (BDM) bidding method.  We choose a BDM bidding
method to generate an incentive compatible data (truthful and accurate)
data on willingness to pay (WTP), which can be used to study the screening and sunck cost effects of prices.  The mechanism of the BDM works as
follows.  Subjects state their individual maximum WTP to buy the item
and this bid placed in a closed envelope.  Those whose WTP is greater
than or equal to a random price will buy the item and pay the random
price (not their WTP) and those whose WTP is less than the random
price will not buy the item and pay zero.  Thus, bidding one's true maximum willingness to pay is a dominant strategy to maximize expected
utility (Becker Name, 1964). 
The BDM method has been used in other contexts such as new brand
name meat, mosquito nets, etc.  (e. g. , Lusk Name, 2001.  Feldkamp Name,
2005.  Hoffmann, 2009).  Although the Vickrey auction method also can
be used to generate an incentive-compatible WTP, the design of the Vickrey auction method is not suitable for the case when multiple buyers can
successfully bid to buy the item.  This is because, in a Vickrey auction,
each subject simultaneously submits a bid to purchase a good and the
agent who submits the highest bid wins the auction and pays an amount
equal to the second-highest bid among the bidders.  The other bidders do
not receive the item.  they pay zero (Vickrey, 1961).  A take-it-or-leave-it
pricing mechanism may also be used to test the screening and sunk cost
effects of the prices of improved stoves.  however, that approach, would
not generate WTP data, and it is difﬁcult to test the screening effect without WTP data. 
In these experiment villages, subjects were randomly invited to participate in the experiment individually (husband or wife) and jointly (i. e. 
both husband and wife) (see Fig. -1 of Appendix A).  We informed these
subjects that they were randomly selected to come to the farmers' training center on a speciﬁed date for two to 4h of compensated physical
work (weeding) and two more hours participating in a similar study. 
All those randomly selected were willing to come and participated in
the physical work and experiment study. 
The physical work was introduced to make farmers buy the improved
stove using income earned from this work.  Conducting an experiment
with real labor income ensures that households in the study area had income available so that they could follow through on a purchase decision. 
This is important because almost all households in the study area depend
on earned income, mainly agricultural income.  thus, the study created
realistic conditions.  Further, subjects may treat windfall income and
earned income differently in the decision to buy the stove.  This is in
line with the theory of mental accounting which stipulates that consumers tend to arrange expenditures into separate mental accounts
and how the money is spent depends on how it is acquired (Hoffmann,
2009).  Proponents of the theory of mental accounting argue that income
earned in exchange for labor is treated differently than windfall income. 
As discussed in Christiaensen and Pan (2012), there is a notion in many
societies around the world (including the study area) that money that is
earned more easily is spent more easily, as exempliﬁed by the expression
‘Easy come, easy go’, an expression which ﬁnds its counterpart across the
world's languages, including ‘Bekelalu Yemta Bekalau Yehedal’ in Amharic, a main language of Ethiopia.  As evidence of this notion, they
found that farmers in China and Tanzania tend to spend earned income
on necessities, while windfall income is spent on alcohol and other luxury items.  Further, Thaler (1990) and Clingingsmith (2015) documented
that subjects share less from an earned dollar than from a windfall dollar. 
Earned income and windfall income can thus be considered different
mental accounts. 
Before the invited subjects of our stove experiment arrived at the
place of the experiment, the subjects did not know anything about
the stove purchase and purpose of the experiment.  This was done
to avoid information spread, pre-experiment spousal inﬂuence and
self-selection in attending the experiment. 
2. 2.  The purchase experiment design and procedures. 
The stove purchase experiment was conducted in three steps.  First,
based on prior random assignment as individual or couples, individual
subjects were instructed to work the weeding activity for 4 h and
couples were instructed to work for 2 h. 3 They were also informed
that, at the end of the study, remuneration would be paid in proportion
to the time invested.  A husband or wife who participated alone would
get ETB 150 and a couple would get only ETB150.  We also told them
that it was not possible to choose only one of the two activities (either
weeding or participating in the experiment).  No payment would be
given if they did not participate in both activities.  Fortunately, no subject
rejected participating in both activities nor asked to participate in only
one of the activities.  After the weeding was complete, we provided
information about the mirt stove (see Appendix B for the details of
experiment procedures). 
Then, we asked the subjects to make the purchase decision based on
the BDM random price mechanism.  The mechanism works as follows. 
Participants were asked to bid a price for an improved stove by stating
their maximum willingness to pay.  Subjects were given a color copy of
currency notes representing actual currency and an envelope in which
to place the amount they were willing to pay to buy the stove.  We
explained that, at the end, all subjects would be gathered in one place
and a random price would be selected from a bucket containing the
following prices.  30, 45, 60, 75, 90,105, 120, 135 and 150.  These prices
were unknown to the participants. 4 Those who bid at or above the
randomly drawn price would purchase the item and those who bid
below the price would not purchase the stove.  Under this procedure,
it would be in the best interest of the participants to bid according to
their actual valuation of the improved stove.  We explained to participants that, if they stated an amount higher than the maximum they
actually want to pay, they would be forced to pay it if that price was
randomly chosen.  On the other hand, if they bid a price below their
actual willingness to pay and a lower price was drawn, they would
not be allowed to buy, even if they wanted to buy it at this randomly
drawn price.  To avoid the effect of the experimenter, one experimenter
explained the mechanism of the BDM for each group in all villages.  A
subject participating in the stove purchase experiment might ask the
need of stating his/her/their maximum WTP instead of just asking
him/her to pay a price.  Before the subjects could raise such questions,
we gave an explanation using the following statements. 
“You might wonder why we ask you to give a bid for the stove instead
of just asking you to pay a price.  Well, this research tries to establish
how valuable such improved stoves are to you.  We would therefore
ask you to think carefully about the most you would be willing to
pay for the stove. ”
[(See Appendix B for the details of the script of the experiment. )]
Before they started the actual bidding for the improved stove, we did
a practice experiment using a pencil.  We took two different pencils of
different quality.  One is an improvement over the other.  The standard
pencil is made with wooden material, standard lead and a standard
eraser, while the improved one is made of plastic material, high quality
lead and a quality eraser.  The improved one is better in terms of
strength of the lead during use and cleanliness of the paper after using
the eraser.  In the experiment, all were familiar with the standard pencil,
but did not know about the other pencil.  We asked them the maximum
price they were willing to pay for the improved pencil.  This practice
experiment was done in each group. 
To make the bids for the stove as conﬁdential as possible, subjects
were placed as far apart as possible.  we instructed subjects to keep
their bids conﬁdential.  and we directed them not to talk to each other
or ask questions in public, from the beginning to the end.  If they had
questions, we asked them to raise their hands and the experimenter
would give answers privately.  At the end, all groups were called back
to one place and a subject among them would pick a price from a bucket
containing the stated prices. 
3.  Empirical strategy. 
We conducted a follow up survey of improved stove installation
ﬁfteen months after delivery.  The length of waiting time to start using
the improved stove is measured by the number of months a household
has waited to get started using the stove since the household got the
stove.  Its value ranges from 0 to 15 where zero means immediate use
and 15 means they have delayed starting to use it until the last month
(i. e. , they have started using the stove in last month).  One might suggest
OLS to estimate the effect of distribution type, price incentives and WTP
on the length of waiting time to start using the improved stove because
the length of waiting time is a continuous dependent variable.  However,
the maximum value of the dependent variable may be limited by
the monitoring month.  This is because households were informed a
month in advance that a survey team would come to each household
for stove monitoring and conduct interview.  About 22% of the households installed the stove during the last month and the remainder
installed earlier.  Therefore, following Wooldridge (2010, 785–790),
we set the following censored model for length of waiting time. 
where εi is the error term, Xi is a vector of regressors, β is a vector of
∗ is a latent length of waiting time to start
parameters and waiting timei
using the improved stove which is observed for values less than the
upper bound, set by the survey time period (τ =15) and censored
otherwise.  The observed waiting time is deﬁned by the following
measurement equations. 
Assuming waiting time is normally distributed with mean Xiβ and
variance σ 2, we can use the maximum likelihood estimation method
using the following log likelihood function for a censored normal
regression model. 
One can use the STATA command Tobit with ul(15) option to
estimate the correlates ofwaiting time.  Our interest is in estimating the
causal relationship between the explanatory variables-distribution
types, e. g. , free versus paid and WTP and length of waiting time to start
using the improved stoves.  Below we show that our experiment design
ensures that the effects of our explanatory variables are causal. 
In what follows, by making our explanatory variables of interest
explicit in the latent waiting time models, we provide descriptions of
the variables of interest and discuss the mechanism of causation.  In
∗ denotes the wife's5 latent waiting time and
Eq.  (4), waiting timei
distribution_type is the experimental variable which indicates whether
the stoves where distributed for free or purchased for a price.  It takes
a value one if the household paid money for the stove and zero if the
stove was received for free.  Xi is a vector of other characteristics speciﬁc
to the wife (such as her education), household level socio-economic
characteristics (such as wealth), and location dummies.  and εi is the
error term in the equation. 
Villages were randomly assigned to the purchase and free distribution experiments.  First, six villages were randomly selected using stratiﬁed simple random sampling for the purchase experiment. 6 In order to
randomly select villages for the free distribution, we purposively excluded villages that are adjacent or very close to the purchase villages
on the list. 7 In each of these villages' types, households were randomly
selected using systemic sampling methods.  Because the assignment of
villages into purchase or free distribution is random, the assignment
of households into these two groups is also random.  Households within
the same village have the same treatment status.  The effect of the distribution type on the length of use is causal because the “distribution type”
(assignment into these two groups) is exogenous to the households. 
The variable “distribution type” measures whether people who paid
for the stove are more likely to start using the stove earlier, i.  whether
people were more likely to start using it as soon as possible because
an investment had already been made and they didn't want to feel or
appear wasteful.  In other words, this variable measures the effect of
sunk cost.  In other words, this variable measures the effect of sunk cost. 
One of the objectives of this paper is to test whether households with
a higher willingness to pay are also more likely to start using the product
sooner, i. e. , the screening effect hypothesis.  In order to test this hypothesis, we need to include WTP as an explanatory variable in the model. 
Willingness to pay data is obtained from subjects' participation in the
BDM experiment.  Hence, this hypothesis is tested for subjects who participate in the bidding experiment and got the improved cookstove
from that experiment.  Eq.  (5) below is set up to test this hypothesis. 
Unlike the previous models, the main explanatory variable, in
Eq.  (5), WTP may not be exogenous, i. e. , subjects' WTP may be correlated
with their unobserved characteristics such as risk and uncertainty. 
Subjects who are uncertain about the beneﬁts of the improved stove
may state lower WTP and if they got a stove through the BDM's random
price, they may not start using it quickly.  If this is the case, the standard
Tobit regression will result in inconsistent estimates.  Hence to get consistent estimates, we use an instrumental Tobit regression method.  We use
the dummy variable ‘individual decision’ as an instrument.  This variable
takes a value of one if the purchase decision is made individually by one
suppose and zero for a joint decision.  For an instrument to be valid, it
must be exogenous and relevant.  Below we discuss how this instrument
can satisfy these two conditions. 
Subjects were randomly assigned into an individual or joint purchase
decision.  Individual means either the husband or wife was randomly
assigned to make the purchase decision alone (thus eliciting an individual WTP).  Joint means that a couple was randomly assigned to make the
decision jointly (thus eliciting a joint WTP).  Because subjects were not
allowed to choose whether to make the decision individually or jointly,
this instrumental variable is exogenous.  A test of the randomization is
conducted by running a probit regression of the decision type on socioeconomic characteristics of the subjects.  Table 3 shows that there is no
signiﬁcant difference between subjects who made the decision the individually and jointly, which implicitly conﬁrms that the instrument is exogenous.  The decision type (individual vs joint) will not affect use of the
improved stove directly and will only affect the stove use indirectly
through WTP.  Hence the instrument is relevant. 
4.  Data, survey instrument and descriptive statistics. 
4. 1.  Data, and survey instrument. 
A baseline and follow-up survey was conducted in 12 villages
(kushets) in the region that represents these major weather and forest
conditions. 8 We randomly selected 50 households from each village
using a list of households obtained from each village's administrator. 
In villages with free distribution of stoves, 25 households from each
village are treatments (i. e. , those who received the free stove) and the remaining 25 are controls. 9 However, in the villages where we conducted
the stove purchase experiment, all 50 subjects from each village participated in the experiment.  The bidding experiment results in 146 households with improved stove and the remaining with no improved stove. 
We conducted a baseline survey two weeks before the stove
purchase experiment and free distribution of the improved stoves.  In
the survey, households were asked about their socio-economic characteristics, fuel use, cooking practices, awareness about adverse consequences of cooking with traditional stoves, awareness about improved
cookstove, household decision-making power, etc.
