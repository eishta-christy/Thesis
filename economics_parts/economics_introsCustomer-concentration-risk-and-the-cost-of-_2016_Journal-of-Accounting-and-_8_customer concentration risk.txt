Business risks stemming from a firm's business model and operating environment are important determinants of its cost of
equity capital (Modigliani and Miller, 1958).  One characteristic that regulators, researchers, and practitioners view as important in
assessing the risks inherent in a firm's current and future cash flows is the concentration of the firm's customer base.  For instance,
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.  131 (previously SFAS No.  14) requires firms to disclose information about
major customers because these customers represent “a significant concentration of risk. ” The SEC under Regulation S-K Item 101
also has similar disclosure requirements.  Further, anecdotal evidence suggests that firms explicitly recognize this risk. 4 While
approximately 45% of public firms report relying on at least one customer for a sizeable portion of revenues (Ellis Name, 2012),
there is surprisingly little empirical evidence on whether customer concentration risk affects firms’ financing costs.  In this study,
we aim to fill this gap by investigating the relation between the concentration of a supplier’s customer base and its cost of equity.
