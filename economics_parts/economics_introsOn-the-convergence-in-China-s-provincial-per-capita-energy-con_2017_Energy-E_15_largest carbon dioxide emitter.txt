 1.  Introduction Energy serves as the material basis of human activity and a prerequisite to and guarantee of economic development.  With its rapid economic development, China's energy consumption has signiﬁcantly increased in recent decades.  from 1. 04 billion tons of standard coal in 1991 to 4. 26 billion tons in 2014.  At the beginning of China's reform and opening up, the level of economic development was relatively low, and the scale of energy consumption was relatively small.  China's energy consumption surged with the expansion of reform and opening up and the rapid development of its economy.  During the last several decades, China has achieved remarkable economic growth, and the living standard of Chinese citizens has been signiﬁcantly improved.  In the meanwhile, alongside robust economic growth and rapid industrialization and urbanization, China's energy consumption was soaring In 1992, China's total energy consumption exceeded its total energy production for the ﬁrst time, and since then, the gap between energy consumption and production has grown.  To meet the increasing energy demand, energy imports have continued to grow, and this has become a potential hurdle to China's sustainable development.  In addition, because coal dominates China's energy mix, the rapid increase in energy consumption has also had a negative inﬂuence on environmental quality, which is visually reﬂected by the serious haze and smog pollution that have affected most areas of eastern and northern China in recent years.  Since 2006, China has replaced the U. S.  as the largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world.  There is evidence that the current development pattern is not consistent with China's pursuit of sustainable and harmonious development.
