Shareholders hire a CEO and design the compensation contract to mitigate agency costs and motivate the CEO to make
value-increasing decisions.  In addition to the compensation contract, the ﬁrm's debt contract terms and the possibility that
the ﬁrm's creditors may wrest control of the ﬁrm also motivate the CEO.  From the perspective of the shareholders, who each
year revise the CEO's compensation contract, the incentives provided by long-term debt contracts are pre-existing.
