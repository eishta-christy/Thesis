In recent decades, the phenomenon of global warming caused by
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become extremely serious,
resulting in more frequent and intense extreme weather and natural disasters.  As well known, the carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption are the nuclear source of the GHG emissions.  Therefore, mitigating
carbon emissions has become a global assignment to realize low carbon
sustainable development.  In response to climate change, many countries have reached basic agreements on mitigating carbon emissions. 
The Paris Climate Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol show the world's determination to cope with climate change issue.  As the largest developing country and the largest carbon emitter, China enacted the energy
intensity target policy and a series of binding policies during the 11th
“Five-Year Plan” (FYP) (2006–2010) and achieved a success in energy
saving and energy intensity reduction (Cao and Karplus, 2014.  Fujii
Name, 2016).  In 2009, China has ofﬁcially raised the carbon intensity
constraint target that carbon emissions per GDP (i. e.
