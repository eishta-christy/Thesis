In order to supply end-user customers and determine optimum selling price for expected proﬁt maximization, uncertainty modeling of
market price and demand should be done by retailer (Growe-Kuska
Name, 2003).  The retailer can determine the selling price based on
ﬁxed price, time-of-use price or real-time price.  Finally, the retailer
should prepare the curves for day-ahead market to purchase (sell)
power from (to) the power market.  It should be noted that retailer
can use the power market, bilateral contracts, self-dispatchable distributed generation units (DGs) and renewable energy sources (PV systems
& wind turbines) to supply demand of customers.  But, sometimes it is
possible that demand of customers is low.  Therefore, surplus energy
from renewable energy sources and DG units can be sold to power market by retailer.  Therefore, in addition to determining the optimal bidding curves, optimal offering curves of retailer are obtained based on
proposed robust optimization approach in the proposed paper. 
1. 1.  Literature review. 
The researches about determination of retail price by retailer are
generally classiﬁed into three time periods containing long-term, midterm and short-term planning.  The review of related researches is categorized based on objective function, type of selling price determination,
solution methodology and uncertainty modeling. 
In long-term planning, Ref.  (Nojavan Name (2017d) minimizes total
cost without pricing, uncertainty modeling, demand response program
(DRP) and smart grid technology and maximization of expected proﬁt
considering uncertainty modeling using scenario-based stochastic
model is provided in Ref.  Ahmadi Name (2013) without pricing. 
It should be mentioned that used ROA in Khojasteh and Jadid (2015)
and Nojavan and Aalami (2015) is related to mid-term planning of
retailer in which only the bidding curve has been obtained without pricing while the proposed ROA is used in this paper in short-term planning
of retailer to obtain the bidding and offering curves for the power
market under ﬁxed pricing (FP), time-of-use pricing (TOU) and realtime pricing (RTP). 
Furthermore, short-term planning of retailer is reviewed in Hatami
Name (2009), Nojavan Name (2015b), 2017c, Charwand Name (2015),
Mahmoudi-Kohan Name (2010a), Hajati Name (2011), and Fleten and
Pettersen (2005).  These researches are organized similar to mid-term
planning.  The objective functions of short-term planning are profit
maximization (Hatami Name, 2009.  Nojavan Name, 2015b, 2017c. 
Mahmoudi-Kohan Name, 2010a.  Hajati Name, 2011.  Fleten and Pettersen,
2005) or costminimization (Charwand Name, 2015.  Mahmoudi-Kohan
Name, 2010a.  Nojavan Name, 2017c).  Unlike mid-term planning, realtime
pricing (Hajati Name, 2011.  Nojavan Name, 2017c) as well as fixed
pricing (Hatami Name, 2009.  Mahmoudi-Kohan Name, 2010a.  Fleten
and Pettersen, 2005) and time-of-use pricing (Nojavan Name, 2015b)
are used as different types of selling price in short-term planning. 
Also, Stackelberg game (Nojavan Name, 2017c), genetic algorithm
(Charwand Name, 2015) or GAMS (Hatami Name, 2009.  Nojavan Name,
2015b.  Mahmoudi-Kohan Name, 2010a.  Hajati Name, 2011.  Fleten and
Pettersen, 2005) are used to solve the problem.  Furthermore, in
Nojavan Name (2015b), Charwand Name (2015), and Hajati Name
(2011) the uncertainty modeling is not considered.  Also, scenario
based method and IGDT are used as uncertainty modeling approaches
in Hatami Name (2009), Fleten and Pettersen (2005), Nojavan Name
(2017c) and Mahmoudi-Kohan Name (2010a), respectively. 
1. 2.  Aims, scope, procedure and contributions. 
In this paper, the electricity market price uncertainty implies that
the final profit of the retailer is unknown.  Therefore, input parameters
uncertainty modeling is necessary.  Since forecasted price is “probably
wrong”, we rely on the minimum and maximum limits of electricity
market price versus the real estimation (Kettunen Name, 2010). 
Moreover, we incorporate these upper and lower bounds for the forecasted
price with robust optimization approach (as explained in Ref. 
Gabriel Name, 2002) to create the bidding (offering) curves of retailer
for optimal bidding (offering) to the day-ahead market.  The proﬁt of
retailer can be modeled as a MIP problem considering the forecasted
price.  If the upper and lower bounds for the forecasted price are considered instead of price forecast, the optimal bidding (offering) strategy
can be reformulated as an robust mixed integer linear programming
(RMIP) problem (Gabriel Name, 2002).  Regarding the upper and lower
bounds of price, the proposed approach conducts to robust decision
within the deﬁned price limits.  This robustness decision is important
and contributes to the price-taker retailer which optimal bidding and
offering strategies are obtained based on the proposed robust optimization approach.  Also, robust scheduling of alternative energy sources
containing pool market, bilateral contracts, DG units and energy storage
system is obtained based on the proposed robust optimization approach.  Furthermore, scenario-based stochastic framework is used for
uncertainty modeling of demand, wind speed, irradiation and temperature.  Based on the explanation above, the novelty and contributions of
this research can be listed as follows. 
1) Optimal bidding and offering curves of retailer are obtained based on the robust optimization approach. 
2) Robust scheduling of alternative energy sources is evaluated based on the proposed approach. 
The paper is organized as follows.  Optimal selling price determination
for the retailer under uncertainties is modeled in Section 2. 
Background of robust optimization approach is presented in Section 3. 
The proposed robust models as well as the flowchart algorithm for
obtaining the optimal bidding (offering) curves of retailer are provided
in Section 4.  The results of three case studies have been presented and
analyzed in Section 5.  Finally, the relevant conclusions are presented
in Section 6. 
Furthermore, short-term planning of retailer is reviewed in Hatami
Name (2009), Nojavan Name (2015b), 2017c, Charwand Name (2015),
Mahmoudi-Kohan Name (2010a), Hajati Name (2011), and Fleten and
Pettersen (2005).  These researches are organized similar to mid-term
planning.  The objective functions of short-term planning are proﬁt
maximization (Hatami Name, 2009.  Nojavan Name, 2015b, 2017c. 
Mahmoudi-Kohan Name, 2010a.  Hajati Name, 2011.  Fleten and Pettersen,
2005) or cost minimization (Charwand Name, 2015.  Mahmoudi-Kohan
Name, 2010a.  Nojavan Name, 2017c).  Unlike mid-term planning, realtime pricing (Hajati Name, 2011.  Nojavan Name, 2017c) as well as ﬁxed
pricing (Hatami Name, 2009.  Mahmoudi-Kohan Name, 2010a.  Fleten
and Pettersen, 2005) and time-of-use pricing (Nojavan Name, 2015b)
are used as different types of selling price in short-term planning. 
Also, Stackelberg game (Nojavan Name, 2017c), genetic algorithm
(Charwand Name, 2015) or GAMS (Hatami Name, 2009.  Nojavan Name,
2015b.  Mahmoudi-Kohan Name, 2010a.  Hajati Name, 2011.  Fleten and
Pettersen, 2005) are used to solve the problem.  Furthermore, in
Nojavan Name (2015b), Charwand Name (2015), and Hajati Name
(2011) the uncertainty modeling is not considered.  Also, scenario
based method and IGDT are used as uncertainty modeling approaches
in Hatami Name (2009), Fleten and Pettersen (2005), Nojavan Name
(2017c) and Mahmoudi-Kohan Name (2010a), respectively.

1. 3.  Structure of the paper. 
The paper is organized as follows.  Optimal selling price determination for the retailer under uncertainties is modeled in Section 2. 
Background of robust optimization approach is presented in Section 3. 
The proposed robust models as well as the ﬂowchart algorithm for
obtaining the optimal bidding (offering) curves of retailer are provided
in Section 4.  The results of three case studies have been presented and
analyzed in Section 5.  Finally, the relevant conclusions are presented
in Section 6. 
<Middle> Problem formulation. 
The objective function is to maximize the expected profit of the
retailer (revenue minus cost) in day-ahead market.  The revenue is
obtained from selling energy to the end users.  Also, the total procurement
cost of retailer includes the purchased costs of energy from pool
market, bilateral contracts and dispatchable distributed generation
units (DGs). 
The energy procurement cost due to bilateral contracts is expressed
by Eq.  (1).  The allowable limits of procured power through bilateral
contract and total energy procurement from bilateral contracts are
expressed in Eqs.  (2) and (3), respectively (Nojavan Name, 2017b). 
A piecewise linear operation cost modeling of DG units is expressed
in Eq.  (5) according to Conejo Name (2005).  The technical constraints are
presented in Eqs.  (6)–(13).  The purchased energy from DGs is limited
by Eqs.  (6) and (7).  Also, the ramp up/down rate limits are expressed
in constraints (Eqs.  (8) and (9)), respectively.  Finally, Eqs.  (10) and
(11) describe theminimumup/down time constraints.  Also, the auxiliary
variables Upi, j and Dni, j are defined in Eqs.  (12) and (13) for linear
modeling of minimum up/down time of DGs (Aalami and Nojavan,The available power ofwind turbine and PV systemcan be calculated
using Eqs.  (14) and (15) according to Conejo Name (2005), respectively. 
Also, it should be noted that the Weibull distribution curve is used to
generate scenarios for wind speed and normal distribution curve is
used to generate scenarios for radiation and temperature uncertainty
modeling in stochastic model. 
The technical constraints of ESS are presented in Eqs.  (16)–(21)
(Shahidehpour Name, 2002).  The initial condition of ESS is expressed in
Eq.  (16).  Eqs.  (17)–(18) consider the power limits of charging and
discharging modes.  The lower and upper limits of stored energy in ESS
are expressed in Eq.  (19).  Eq.  (20) shows the binary mode of charge
and discharge which cannot occur simultaneously.  The energy dynamic
model of ESS is shown in Eq.  (21). 
Versus the determination of selling price by retailer (SP(l, t)),
customers are ﬂexible.  Also, the retailer sets a quantity from customers
demand based on price-demand curve of customers offered to the
retailer to procure their demand (D(l,t,s)) according to Fig.  1.  This ﬁgure
shows the price-demand curve of customers for 1 h.  According to Fig.  1,
high selling price makes many customers not purchase from this retailer
which leads to reduction of supplied demand by retailer.  Also, low
selling price leads to increase of supplied demand by retailer since
many customers purchase their demands from the retailer.  Therefore,
retailer should determine the optimal selling price to maximize his
expected proﬁt. 
Supplied demand by the retailer is computed by equations shown below. 
Through Eqs.  (22)–(25), it is clear that the demand of each customer
supplied by the retailer in every period is a function of selling price. 
The revenue obtained fromcustomer l in time period t by selling energy
to the end-user customers can be computed as follows. 
Finally, the profit objective function of the retailer can be expressed as this. 
The proposed objective function (28) should be maximized subject
to constraints (1)–(27).
