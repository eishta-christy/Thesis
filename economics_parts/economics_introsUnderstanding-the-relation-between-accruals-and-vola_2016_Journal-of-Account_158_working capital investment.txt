 Introduction Accruals are fundamental to ﬁnancial reporting and are the underlying innovation of accounting.  While a long line of prior research notes that accruals are likely to be a function of fundamental economic forces, little is known empirically or theoretically about how economic factors impact the level of a ﬁrm's accruals (e. g. , Dechow et al. , 1995.  Bernard and Skinner, 1996.  Dechow et al. , 2010.  Gerakos, 2012.  Owens et al. , 2013).  Further, prior research generally disaggregates accruals at time tþ1 into discretionary and non-discretionary components based on ﬁnancial information observed at time tþ1.  therefore, the research has provided little guidance for forming expectations of accruals based on ex ante ﬁrm characteristics.  In this study, we consider accruals as a form of investment and examine whether theoretical predictions from a real options-based investment framework provide insights for forming expectations of accruals based on ex ante economic factors.  Prior research in accounting suggests that accruals at least partially reﬂect deliberate investment choices by the ﬁrm (Fairﬁeld et al. , 2003.  Zhang, 2007.  Dechow et al. , 2008.  Wu et al. , 2010.  Bushman et al. , 2011.  Allen et al. , 2013.  Momente et al. , 2013.  Arif and Lee, 2014).  In addition, a large literature in economics and ﬁnance adopts a real options approach to investment decision-making and suggests a negative relation between investment and volatility (e. g. , Bernanke, 1983.  McDonald and Siegel, 1986.  Ingersoll and Ross, 1992.  Dixit and Pindyck, 1994.  Schwartz and Trigeorgis, 2004.  Grenadier and Malenko, 2010). 2 The intuition for the expected negative relation between investment and volatility is as follows.  Investment is costly, and sunk costs cannot be recovered.  Therefore, when ﬁrms make investment decisions, they trade off the returns earned from investing today against the beneﬁt from delaying investment to the future, when information or business conditions may be better.  Taking into account the beneﬁt of postponing investment – known as the “option to wait” – means that since higher volatility increases the value of the option to wait, higher volatility dampens investment because ﬁrms prefer to “wait and see” instead of investing immediately.  Thus, higher (lower) volatility is associated with lower (higher) investment.  Adopting the investment perspective of accruals, our ﬁrst hypothesis is that a ﬁrm's level of accruals is negatively associated with volatility.  We note, however, that this prediction from the real options framework may not directly apply to accruals.  For example, models of optimal inventory suggest that managers have incentives to avoid inventory shortages and therefore increase inventory levels as demand volatility rises (e. g. , Petruzzi and Dada, 1999.  Cachon and Terwiesch, 2013).  This research therefore suggests a positive relation between investment in ﬁnished goods inventory and volatility.  Despite this potentially countervailing force, we adopt the investment perspective and rely on the real options framework to predict a negative relation between the level of a ﬁrm's net working capital accruals and volatility.  Second, we investigate the role of ﬁnancial distress in shaping the relation between accruals and volatility.  Eisdorfer (2008) models the investment decisions of ﬁnancially distressed ﬁrms using a real options framework and ﬁnds that ﬁnancial distress weakens the negative effect of volatility on investment.  This is because shareholders of distressed ﬁrms have an incentive to invest when volatility is higher since they enjoy the beneﬁts if things go well, while bondholders bear the costs if things go badly.  Accordingly, we predict that the negative association between the level of working capital accruals and volatility is less pronounced for distressed ﬁrms.  Third, we exploit the real options framework to form predictions regarding the relation between the length of the operating cycle and the association between accruals and volatility.  The operating cycle measures the average time between the disbursement of cash to produce a product and the receipt of cash from the sale of the product (Dechow, 1994).  therefore, ﬁrms with a longer operating cycle have greater exposure to changing business conditions and a wider range of possible accrual investment outcomes.  This suggests that the option to wait is more valuable for ﬁrms with a longer operating cycle.  Thus, we hypothesize that the sensitivity of net working capital accruals to volatility is stronger for ﬁrms with a longer operating cycle.  Fourth, we investigate whether the asset and liability components of net working capital accruals have differing sensitivities to volatility.  We predict that volatility not only negatively affects current asset accruals but also current liability accruals, given that liabilities partially ﬁnance investments and thus positively co-vary with investment by nature.  However, we expect current asset accruals to be more sensitive to volatility than current liability accruals since investment decisions have ﬁrst-order implications for asset accruals but affect liability accruals only to the extent that managers use liabilities instead of internally generated cash ﬂows or equity issuances to ﬁnance the investment.  To empirically test our predictions, we examine the relation between year-ahead working capital accruals and expected volatility.  We highlight that our approach is distinct from prior accounting literature that disaggregates accruals into discretionary and non-discretionary components (e. g. , Healy, 1985.  DeAngelo, 1986.  Jones, 1991.  Dechow et al. , 1995).  Speciﬁcally, while the prior earnings management literature models total working capital accruals in year tþ1 as a function of explanatory variables which are also measured in year tþ1 (e. g.  Healy, 1985.  DeAngelo, 1986.  Jones, 1991.  Dechow et al. , 1995), we model accruals in year tþ1 as a function of characteristics in year t.  Further, we view accruals as a form of investment, rather than as a component of proﬁtability.  As such, our model is grounded in the real options-based investment framework, in which measures of the ﬁrm's characteristics and economic environment (such as expected volatility, ﬁrm size, market-to-book, leverage, and cash ﬂows) are used as inputs into investment decisions (e. g.  Hayashi, 1982.  Dixit and Pindyck ,1994.  Gilchrist and Himmelberg, 1995.  Eisdorfer, 2008).  Our empirical analysis begins by replicating the ﬁnding in Eisdorfer (2008) that there is a signiﬁcant negative relation between year-ahead capital expenditures and expected volatility for a sample of manufacturing ﬁrms.  We then extend the analysis to net working capital accruals and ﬁnd a robust negative relation between year-ahead net working capital accruals and expected volatility in this manufacturing ﬁrm sample.  Next, we broaden the sample to all non-ﬁnancial and non-utility ﬁrms and ﬁnd, consistent with the economic theory, that higher expected volatility has a dampening effect on year-ahead net working capital investment.  In addition, consistent with our predictions, we ﬁnd that the association between year-ahead net working capital accruals and expected volatility is less pronounced for ﬁrms in ﬁnancial distress and more pronounced for ﬁrms with a longer operating cycle.  We then decompose year-ahead net working capital accruals into its asset and liability components and examine the relation of each component with expected volatility.  Consistent with our expectations, we ﬁnd that both current asset and current liability accruals are negatively associated with expected volatility.  Moreover, asset accruals are more sensitive to expected volatility than liability accruals, giving rise to the overall negative relation between net working capital accruals and expected volatility.  We provide two types of robustness tests.  First, we note that our dependent variable (i. e. , year-ahead accruals) is affected not only by expected volatility but also by expected demand.  Thus, as a robustness test, we include additional controls for expected demand as of the end of year t – including the consensus analyst forecast of year-ahead sales, the median consensus analyst forecast of year-ahead sales for the industry, and prior 12-month stock returns – and continue to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant negative relation between year-ahead accruals and expected volatility.  Second, we acknowledge that year-ahead accruals also contain an unexpected component that may be affected by unexpected demand in year tþ1.  While our primary speciﬁcation controls for unexpected demand with year-ahead stock returns, we explore its robustness to additional controls for unexpected demand – including the year-ahead change in sales, year-ahead employee growth, and the year-ahead change in the consensus analyst sales forecast – and ﬁnd that our results are robust to the inclusion of these additional controls.  Finally, we examine the implications of the investment perspective of accruals and the real options-based investment framework for earnings management research.  We note that the primary aim of our study is not to develop a new accrualbased earnings management proxy.  however, we provide evidence that the residuals from an investment-based expected accrual model have discriminating ability for identifying ﬁrms that just meet or beat earnings expectations.  In fact, the residuals from the investment-based expected accrual model appear to have more discriminating ability for identifying ﬁrms that meet or beat expectations than those from the commonly-employed performance-adjusted modiﬁed Jones model.  This result is particularly striking given that our expected accrual model is based on information known ex ante, whereas the performance-adjusted modiﬁed Jones model is based on information only known in year tþ1.  Our study provides important contributions to the literature.  Understanding the properties of accruals is among the chief goals of ﬁnancial accounting research.  Dechow et al.  (2010), DeFond (2010) and Ball (2013) and others express concern that there is little theory to guide researchers in understanding the economic factors that shape the level of a ﬁrm's accruals.  We draw on real options-based investment theory and document that expected volatility has a pervasive effect on year-ahead accruals.  Further, we show that the investment-based theory applies more strongly for ﬁrms not facing ﬁnancial distress and for ﬁrms with a longer operating cycle.  Accordingly, we provide insight into the ex ante economic characteristics that shape a ﬁrm's level of accruals and therefore provide guidance for forming expectations of accruals.  Our ﬁndings also contribute to the economics and ﬁnance literature studying the factors that shape investment.  This literature has focused on ﬁrms’ capital expenditure decisions and has not considered the predictions for accrual-based investment.  We believe that examining how the investment theories apply to capital expenditures versus accruals, both similarly and differentially, can provide greater insights into the investment policies of ﬁrms.  The paper proceeds as follows.  Section 2 presents the background and hypothesis development.  Section 3 presents variable deﬁnitions and descriptive statistics.  Section 4 presents empirical results, and Section 5 concludes this paper.  2.  Hypotheses development.  Real-world investment decisions tend to share three features, which collectively motivate real option-based investment theory (Dixit, 1992).  First, ﬁrms cannot perfectly forecast the future because the business environment has ongoing uncertainty and information arrives gradually.  Second, investment is costly and difﬁcult to reverse due to frictions such as sunk costs, i. e.  investment tends to be at least partially “irreversible”.  Third, an investment opportunity does not generally disappear if no investment is made immediately, i. e.  ﬁrms generally have the option to postpone investment to the future.  Under the real options-based investment framework, a manager's decision to invest involves a tradeoff between investing immediately or instead postponing investment to the future.  On the one hand, the beneﬁt of immediate investment is that the ﬁrm is able to start enjoying returns from the investment.  On the other hand, the beneﬁt of waiting is that the manager can gain more information about the value of the investment and take advantage of any improvements in business conditions that occur in the meantime.  This beneﬁt of waiting introduces an opportunity cost to investing today.  At the point when the beneﬁts of waiting equal the costs of waiting, investment occurs.  When volatility is higher, the beneﬁt of waiting (commonly referred to in the literature as the “option to wait”) is higher, and ﬁrms become more cautious in their investment behavior because they prefer to “wait and see” what happens in the future. 3 Motivated by this framework, a large theoretical literature predicts a negative relation between investment and volatility (e. g.  Bernanke, 1983.  McDonald and Siegel, 1986.  Ingersoll and Ross, 1992.  Dixit and Pindyck, 1994.  Schwartz and Trigeorgis, 2004.  Grenadier and Malenko, 2010), and the empirical evidence generally supports this prediction (e. g.  Pindyck and Solimano, 1993.  Leahy and Whited, 1996.  Guiso and Parigi, 1999.  Bond and Cummins, 2004.  Eisdorfer, 2008.  Badertscher et al. , 2013). 4 We adopt the investment perspective of accruals in this paper.  Fairﬁeld et al.  (2003) note that accruals are not only a component of proﬁtability but also a component of investment.  Zhang (2007) and Dechow et al.  (2008) support the investment role of accruals and conclude that the accrual anomaly documented by Sloan (1996) is primarily attributable to the role of accruals as a form of investment.  In addition, investment in the form of accruals reﬂects the three features that motivate real options-based investment theory.  First, ﬁrms cannot perfectly forecast the payoff from working capital accruals.  Second, working capital accruals are at least partially irreversible. 5 Third, ﬁrms generally have at least some control over the timing of working capital accruals.  For example, ﬁrms can postpone working capital investment via managing the timing of inventory purchases and/or the extension of credit to customers.  Therefore, to the extent that accruals are shaped by investment decisions, we expect the predictions of real options-based investment theory to apply to working capital accruals.
