The Transmission Network Expansion Planning Problem (TNEPP)
is a classical problem in power electrical engineering and basically
the problem consists in ﬁnding new transmission lines for an adequate operation over a planning horizon.  Traditionally, the problem
was solved as a separate problem from the generation planning
problem1, even though in the early days most electrical systems
operated with a vertical structure and there was a central planner that somehow gave the conditions to coordinate the investment
decisions in transmission and generation. 
At the end of the 1970s competition was introduced in several
electric utilities2.  In this competitive setting, no central planner is
in charge of investments.  Instead, ﬁrst, generation companies decide
their new capacity in function of their expected beneﬁts in the market. 
Then, the transmission company decides the transmission capacity
needed to transmit the energy from the new generators.  In mathematical terms, this interaction can be modeled by multilevel optimization
problems.  In the specialized literature several multilevel models have
been proposed.  an important remark is that the models implicitly assume that the opportunity cost of transmission capacity is
determined by the price difference at the line endpoints 4. 
This paper recognizes that the opportunity cost of transmission
capacity not only depends on the difference of marginal costs at line
endpoints, but also on the location of new generators.  Due to this,
economic externalities arise when investment decisions are decentralized, so that the decentralized result does not lead to a Pareto
optimal solution. 
A good example of externalities in real power systems is the
Peruvian case.  Before 2014, the Peruvian network consisted of two
large areas (North and South) connected through a long transmission line (220 kV, 612 km).  The Southern area imports electricity
from the North.  Moreover, the South has a large source of gas known
as Camisea Gas and a gas pipeline was built in 2004 in order to
deliver gas to the North.  After the entrance of the pipeline, many
generation companies decided to invest in new capacity only in the
North.  however, electricity demand in the South grew and no generation capacity was built there.  Due to this, a new transmission line
(500 kV, 1000 km) between the North and South was placed in service in the year 2014.  Moreover, another line (500 kV, 1000 km)
between the North and South is been constructed and will be placed
in service by the year 2017.  Badly placed generators introduced
negative externalities in the transmission planning.  Obviously, if
generation companies had invested in the South, no transmission
lines would have been needed. 
In this context, we discuss how separating generation expansion
from transmission planning can cause negative externalities to the
transmission planning problem.  The organization of the paper is as
follows.  in Section 2, we discuss how externalities can affect the
TNEPP using a basic model.  in Section 3, we formulate a centralized
multistage model for ﬁnding simultaneous optimal generation and
transmission capacity.  The model is based on previous work of van
der Weijde and Hobbs (2012) and O’Neill Name (2013).  The main purpose of the model is to show examples of externalities.  In Section 4,
we present case studies for the 24-bus test system and the Peruvian
system.  Finally, in Section 5 we present the conclusions of the article. 
2.  A discussion about transmission capacity opportunity cost
and externalities. 
Some articles5 implicitly assume that the opportunity cost of
transmission capacity is determined only by the price difference at
the line endpoints.  That said, the work of the transmission company
is reduced to ﬁnding the set of transmission lines that minimize the
cost of investment added to the cost of operation, taking the future
generation projects as an input.  The above does not take into account
that relocating the future generators could have avoided the construction of additional lines.  This interdependence of transmission
and generation capacity means that decisions in new transmission
and generation capacity must be coordinated to achieve maximum
total surplus. 
To show our reasoning we use a two-bus system in which all the
parameters are certain6.  Consider the example shown in Fig.  1, the
generator at node A has a marginal cost cA = $4/MWh and the generator at node B has a marginal cost cB = $7/MWh.  Node B needs
1000 MW to meet its demand for a period of t = 105 h, this demand
can be supplied either from a new line or a new generator.  Consider
that 1000 MW of transmission capacity can be built with an investment cost of a = $1 × 106.  Also, 1000 MW of generation capacity
can be built at node B with an investment cost of b = $200 × 106
and a marginal cost of cC = $3/MWh.  Let us ﬁnd the Pareto optimal
solution. 
The demand is modeled as depicted in Fig.  2.  in which electricity demand d is constant (inelastic) until the price reaches a
certain value called the Value of Lost Load (VOLL).  Above the VOLL
the consumers are not willing to pay and a load curtailment r must
be considered.  This is an acceptable approximation for real-world
electricity demand7. 
The total surplus in the model is given by the area below the
demand considering a t number of hours of operation minus the
operation cost OC of running the generators and the investment cost
IC of building new capacity in the electrical system. 
Surplus = voll •(d − r)t − (OC + IC)The power ﬂow of the line is given by fAB (from A to B), power produced by generators A, B and C are given by gA, gB and gC respectively. 
Then, at each node the sum of power ﬂows must be zero.
