 1.  Introduction The essence of the gasoline subsidy policy problem is its inefﬁciency.  The policy leads to overconsumption of gasoline since a subsidy drives consumers to purchase a good at a price that is cheaper than the cost of producing it (Harvey and Gayer, 2013).  Overconsumption also leads to negative externalities such as emission of local pollutants, trafﬁc congestions and accidents (Davis, 2014).  In the case of Indonesia, the problem is further aggravated by the fact that the government only provides a subsidy for regular gasoline, the lowest grade gasoline.
