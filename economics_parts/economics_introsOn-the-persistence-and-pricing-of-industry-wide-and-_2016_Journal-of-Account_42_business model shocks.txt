 This paper examines the relation between industry-wide and firm-specific information contained in earnings and the extent to which this information is reflected in stock prices.  Economic theory suggests that firm performance determined by industry fundamentals (e. g. , consumer taste, production technology, and regulatory environment) is relatively long-lasting.  On the other hand, performance that deviates from industry norms tends to dissipate more quickly because learning and imitation improve industry losers’ performance but erode industry winners’ competitive edge (e. g. , Mueller, 1977, 1986, 1990.  Waring, 1996).  To the extent that accounting earnings are a (noisy) measure of economic profits, we expect the industry-wide component of earnings to be more persistent than the firm-specific component.  Prior research suggests that investors tend to fixate on reported earnings, however, not fully recognizing differences in the persistence of its components (e. g. , Sloan, 1996).  As a result, we expect the market to underreact to the higher persistence of the industry-wide component of earnings.  Predicting greater persistence of the industry-wide component of earnings inherently assumes industry homogeneity and stationarity.  Firms in homogeneous industries face relatively similar economic forces, and thus industry-wide earnings should be more persistent than in heterogeneous industries.  Earnings components should also be more persistent in stable industries than in those disrupted by business shocks.  The effect of business shocks, however, should be smaller on industry-wide earnings than on firm-specific earnings if, as expected, industry-wide earnings are more stationary in general.  Investors that underestimate the persistence of industry-wide earnings are thus more likely to do so for homogeneous industries and in the presence of a large industry-wide business shock.  Our focus on economic fundamentals represents a departure from Sloan’s (1996) work on accruals and cash flows, which are components of earnings defined by accounting systems (Dechow, 1994.  Subramanyam, 1996).  He shows that even though the accrual component is less persistent than the cash flow component, stock prices act as if investors fail to fully appreciate this difference.  Thus, we also gauge the differential persistence and pricing of earnings components classified by both economic forces and accounting constructs.  We decompose industry-wide and firm-specific earnings into their respective cash flow and accrual components.  Considering both economic fundamentals and accounting constructs suggests that industry-wide cash flows is the most persistent component of earnings, while at the other extreme firm-specific accruals is the least persistent.  The relative persistence of the other two components – industry-wide accruals and firmspecific cash flows – is less clear.  On the one hand, there is robust prior evidence that cash flows are more persistent than accruals.  On the other hand, economic theory suggests that industry-wide performance is more persistent than firm-specific performance.  We test our empirical predictions over the period 1988–2011.  Following Bhojraj et al.  (2003), we use Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) industry codes and define industry-wide earnings as average earnings (scaled by assets) of all firms in the same eight-digit GICS industry.  We define firm-specific earnings as the difference between a firm’s reported earnings (scaled by assets) and the industry-wide earnings.  Consistent with predictions, we find that industry-wide earnings are significantly more persistent than firm-specific earnings.  However, investors fail to fully distinguish this differential persistence as stock prices place similar weights on these two earnings components in forecasting one-year-ahead earnings.  In other words, the market underreacts to the persistence of industry-wide earnings and overreacts to the persistence of firm-specific earnings.  To further test the implications of industry fundamentals on the persistence and pricing of earnings components, we partition the sample using three alternative proxies for industry homogeneity, i. e. , within-industry similarity in size, operating activities, or the number of business segments.  As expected, industry-wide earnings are significantly more persistent in homogenous industries compared to heterogeneous industries.  In contrast, the persistence of firm-specific earnings does not vary with industry homogeneity.  Further, the market fails to understand the consequences of industry homogeneity for the relative persistence of industry-wide earnings.  In fact, the underreaction to industry-wide earnings is significant only in homogeneous industries.  In a similar vein, we find that the market fails to understand the consequences of business model shocks on the persistence of earnings components.  We identify large industry-wide business shocks following Guay et al.
