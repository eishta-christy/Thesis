 1.  Introduction About $2 billion of petroleum are traded daily, making petroleum the single largest item in the balance of payment and exchange between countries (Tordo etal. , 2011).  Economies are susceptible to oil supply and price volatility as a result of their strong dependence on oil-based products (Cuñado and Pérez de Gracia, 2003.  Jiménez-Rodríguez and Sánchez, 2005).  This is probably the reason for state interventions in the industry, in the form of National Oil Companies (NOCs).  State ownership of oil companies started in 1914 when the British government acquired a controlling stake in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, now British Petroleum (BP), setting a precedent for the many state-owned oil companies to follow in other countries (Wolf, 2009).  Since 1991, countries that possess NOCs have held nearly 90% of global crude oil reserves (Eller etal. , 2011).  Various governments have seen the oil industry far important to be left in the hands of private International Oil Companies (IOCs) as direct state control over its resources is a strong indicator of national sovereignty (Mommer, 2002).  State ownership in this industry is at the heart of debates on state interventionism, asset nationalization and deregulation policies in the oil industry.  This notwithstanding, to some researchers direct state intervention is seen as a major cause of inefﬁciency in this industry (Kashani, 2005a, 2005b).  The issue of state ownership versus private ownership of oil companies has become the overarching theme of most efﬁciency-related studies in the industry.  Indeed, Al-Obaidan and Scully (1992), Eller etal.  (2011), Ike and Lee (2014), Wolf (2009), and Sueyoshi and Goto (2012) have all provided empirical evidence on the differences in the efﬁciency of state controlled oil companies and privately controlled ones.  Although, these studies mostly favour private ownership, the debate is not dwindling since high energy prices, asset nationalization policy and economic success of some NOCs have re-ignited calls for more state involvement (Wolf, 2009).  There is therefore the need to reconsider how state ﬁrms can be more productive, and stay relevant in this volatile industry, compared to their private counterparts.  Empirical evidence show that one way ﬁrms (both private and state) can improve efﬁciency is through multinational operations (Greene etal. , 2009.  Li, 2008).  A multinational ﬁrm is one that owns and operates income generating assets in more than one country.  A ﬁrm that operates in a single country is a local ﬁrm.  Petroleum ﬁrms are among the largest multinationals internationally (Al-Obaidan and Scully, 1995).  Royal Dutch Shell, Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Exxon Mobil are among the top six global ﬁrms on Fortune Magazine's 2016 global 500 company ranking (Fortune Magazine, 2017).  Even some of the NOCs, who are usually expected to only operate in their home countries, have multinational operations.  For example CNPC, a company with 100% state ownership (Energy Intelligence, 2013), has oil and gas operations in 29 countries around the world (CNPC, 2014).  CNPC is an example of a state-owned multinational oil company (MNOC).  For ﬁrms like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Total, they are privately-owned multinationals (MIOCs).  Indeed, from the theoretical arguments of both the eclectic paradigm (Dunning, 1977) and portfolio diversiﬁcation theory (Markowitz, 1952), multinational operations bring some gains to a ﬁrm's operation in the form of efﬁciency (Al-Obaidan and Scully, 1995).  Though this view that multinational operation improves ﬁrm performance, is quite predominant in theory, more empirical testing of this view in the petroleum industry is needed.  From the evidence gathered, only Al-Obaidan and Scully (1995) have explored performance differences between multinationals and locals in efﬁciency assessment in the oil industry.  However, their study does not consider efﬁciency differences between state-owned multinational companies and privately-owned multinational companies.  Their study also does not consider whether going multinational can make a state ﬁrm more efﬁcient in its operations.  As more and more NOCs consider becoming multinational in their operations, it is important to examine whether such international operation is offsetting the empirically documented inefﬁciencies from state control.  For foreign policy and economic purposes, there is a growing presence of state-owned enterprises in global markets (Bass and Chakrabarty, 2014).  The policy of state-owned enterprises in the international context, even in the oil and gas industry, stems from their desire to gain foreign resources to satisfy both shortterm and long term needs of the home country.  Though this internationalization policy of state ﬁrms is on a massive scale, it is important to note that this is a relatively new phenomenon (Cuervo-Cazurra etal. , 2014) which raises questions on its effectiveness in improving productivity.  The contributions of this study are relevant to both literature and policy.  It contributes to the existing body of knowledge on the efﬁciency differences between state and privately-owned oil companies by introducing and testing the multinational dimension of the ownership debate.  We provide empirical answers on whether multinationalism or internationalization policies of state-owned oil companies provide a viable opportunity for state oil companies to remain relevant in the international oil industry.  We do this by relying on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a nonparametric frontier approach, which is able to estimate efﬁciency of ﬁrms with very few assumptions and has a more ﬂexible production structure (Bogetoft and Otto, 2011).  It can also handle multiple inputs and outputs and can decompose efﬁciency into several factors thereby tracking the sources of inefﬁciencies.  Bootstrapping techniques by Simar and Wilson (1998, 1999, 2000), are also employed to address the ﬂaws of the DEA technique, including outlying observations, its inability to adequately handle statistical noise and its general deterministic nature.  This provides a robust and empirically sound basis for analysis.  The rest of the study is structured as follows.  ﬁrst, we provide some theoretical and empirical review on multinationalism, ownership and efﬁciency.  This is then followed by model and data descriptions from which empirical ﬁndings are provided and conclusions2.  Literature review.  2. 1.  Ownership and ﬁrm performance.  Performance differences between state and privately-owned enterprises have interested academics for some time now.  Theoretical underpinnings of the ownership debate in the international oil industry can be grounded on property rights and agency theories (Al-Obaidan and Scully, 1992.  Eller etal. , 2011.  Wolf, 2009).  Property rights theory is attributable to early works of Coase (1960), Alchian (1965) and Demsetz (1964).  Property rights can be seen as the rights of individuals to use some resources supported by the force of etiquette and formal legally enacted laws supported by state powers of violence and punishment (Alchian, 1965).  State property rights involve inferior governance quality compared to private ownership (Shleifer, 1998), and hence, public enterprises should perform less efﬁciently compared to private enterprises.  For Jensen and Meckling (1976) agency theory of the ﬁrm, an agency relationship arises between two or more parties when one party (the agent) acts for or on behalf of another party (the principal), in a domain of decision problems (Eisenhardt, 1989).  Companies with more private ownership are more likely to have less serious agency problems as compared to state ﬁrms (Ding etal. , 2007).  Therefore, government involvement is the key reason for the inefﬁciency of state-owned enterprises.  Empirically, Al-Obaidan and Scully (1992) have revealed that although private oil ﬁrms (IOCs) are better at converting inputs into outputs (productive efﬁciency), there is little difference in how state(NOCs) and private ﬁrms manage the size of operation (scale efﬁciency).  For Eller etal.  (2011), NOCs are among the least efﬁcient ﬁrms, probably because such NOCs are forced to subsidize fuel for domestic consumption and also employ a larger workforce not necessary for purely commercial objectives.  Similarly, Ike and Lee (2014) observed that IOCs have higher performance.  However, their study provides new insights that even among the NOCs, OPEC NOCs are among the worst performers.  This is not surprising since Wolf (2009) had earlier discovered that the impact of both state ownership and OPEC membership is signiﬁcantly negative in upstream production.  This was attributable to production quota policy of OPEC members having negative inﬂuence on ﬁrm performance.  Finally, although Sueyoshi and Goto (2012) have also contributed to this debate, their paper was more conceptual than empirical.  2. 2.  Multinational operation and ﬁrm performance.  The multinational concept in efﬁciency assessment of oil ﬁrms can be based on two main theoretical arguments- portfolio diversiﬁcation theory (Markowitz, 1952) and eclectic paradigm of international production (Dunning, 1977). International diversiﬁcation or multinational operation is expected to increase ﬁrm efﬁciency and proﬁtability because it can result in economies of scale, provide better and ﬂexible access to resources and allow for more learning (Hennart, 2007).  Multinational business operation also allows ﬁrms to exploit competitive advantages that are not available to domestic ﬁrms (Thomas and Eden, 2004).  This perspective to multinational operation views product and process diversiﬁcation across boundaries as having the potential to improve the risks and return performance of investors by investing in assets (countries) whose returns (economies) are uncorrelated (Annavarjula and Beldona, 2000.  Hennart, 2007).  Therefore, it is expected that ﬁrms that have operations in several countries that are not economically integrated, would enjoy higher productivities as compared to ﬁrms with less geographically diversiﬁed portfolios.  Consequently, it is expected that, multinational oil companies would outperform localized oil ﬁrms.  This is because, such diversiﬁed oil companies are expected to better diversify their countryspeciﬁc market risks by operating in uncorrelated foreign markets.  Multinational activities in the oil industry have attracted empirical interest of Al-Obaidan and Scully (1995), Cuervo-Cazurra etal.
