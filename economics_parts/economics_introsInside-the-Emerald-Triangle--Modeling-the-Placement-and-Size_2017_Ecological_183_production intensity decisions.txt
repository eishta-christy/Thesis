Land-use conversions from forested and natural lands to agricultural
landscapes are a leading cause of biodiversity decline worldwide
(Gibson Name, 2011.  Laurance Name, 2014).  Agricultural conversions
also release large amounts of carbon and contribute signiﬁcantly to climate change (Mendelsohn and Dinar, 2009).  Economic models of agricultural land-use change have proved helpful in understanding the
ecological consequences of land conversion across multiple scales and
for many commodities (Lubowski Name, 2008).  These models can also
be used to predict the environmental impact of changes in agricultural
policy or prices (Lawler Name, 2014.  Polasky Name, 2008). 
Cannabis represents an emerging agricultural crop of economic and
ecological signiﬁcance (Carah Name, 2015.  Decorte Name, 2011).  Cannabis is now legal, either as a medicine or for recreational use, in over
half the United States and the federal government has signaled potential
shifts in its classiﬁcation of cannabis as well (National Conference of
State Legislatures, 2016).  The market for legal cannabis is already estimated to reach $22. 8 billion nationwide by 2020, approximately double
the value of wheat production (Arcview Market Research, 2014).  The
growth of this industry may lead to clearing of new land for agriculture
or the intensiﬁcation of already established sites. 
While many facets of cannabis production are not well documented,
there is ample evidence that cannabis production can have negative
ecological impacts (Carah Name, 2015).  For instance, illegal cannabis cultivation sites have been linked to rodenticide poisoning throughout
Northern California (Gabriel Name, 2012.  Thompson Name, 2014), and
to dewatering of streams due to irrigation practices (Bauer Name,
2015).  Many grows are located in areas of potential ecological impact,
such as on steep slopes, far from developed road networks, and near
habitat for threatened and endangered ﬁsh species (Butsic and
Brenner, 2016). 
Given its high economic value and potential impact on the environment, surprisingly little is known about the most basic spatial dimensions of this emerging agricultural activity.  Even less is known about
how cannabis farmers choose the location and size of their operations. 
Unlike most agricultural crops in the United States, which are mapped
and recorded by various government departments, the presence of cannabis agriculture has gone widely undocumented, with the exception of
police reports during the era of strong prohibition.  Recent advances in
the availability of high resolution satellite imagery have made it possible
to map cannabis farms at some times of the year across fairly broad spatial scales (Bauer Name, 2015).  One recent study (Butsic and Brenner,
2016) produced baseline data that could be used to model land-use
decisions on cultivation location and size.  With these insights,
policymakers, planners, and others charged with governing this emerging land-use activity might better prepare to mitigate anticipated environmental impacts. 
We use a dataset consisting of 1341 documented cannabis cultivation sites on private land in Humboldt County, California to
model the spatial location and production decisions of cannabis
farmers.  We evaluate the impact of biophysical variables (slope, distance from ocean, distance to water, vegetation cover, and aspect),
network variables (number of plants on nearby parcels), local regulations (zoning), and historical variables (whether or not a timber
harvest has taken place in the last 15 years) on producer decisions. 
In addition, we test to see if the impact of these variables differs for
alternative production methods (outdoor cultivation vs.  greenhouse
cultivation).

2. 1.  Study Area. 
Our study area consists of 54 randomly selected watersheds in Humboldt County, CA which are representative of the county as a whole
(Butsic and Brenner, 2016).  Humboldt County is located in northern
California (Fig.  1) along the Paciﬁc coast and is considered the leading
cannabis producing county in the United States, if the not world.  The
county is a mix of coniferous and hardwood forest with pockets of
open rangeland.  The study area is home to numerous threatened and
endangered species, including.  Chinook and Coho salmon, steelhead
trout, and the northern spotted owl (California Department of Fish
and Wildlife, 2015). 
Due to the steep terrain and poor soils, agriculture is limited to a
relatively small area of the county.  Livestock, dairy, and nursery
production are the largest agricultural sectors ($76, $61, $41
million dollars in sales in 2014) and make up over 95% of all
agricultural production by value.  Timber production contributes
another $72 million in direct sales (Humboldt County, 2015).  In
comparison, the wholesale value of cannabis production is likely
over $300 million, although no ofﬁcial ﬁgures exist (Butsic and
Brenner, 2016). 
2. 2.  Cannabis Production in Humboldt County. 
Cannabis can be legally cultivated in California for medicinal purposes, although the federal government still considers cannabis an illegal Schedule I drug (McGreevy, 2015).  Medical producers (recreational
marijuana will not be legal in California until 2018) must be documented care givers and can supply their crop either to individuals who have
physician approval to use cannabis or to dispensaries, which can sell
cannabis to patients.  During the time period of our study, there was virtually no chain of custody in the cannabis industry, and the supply chain
from growers to consumers was undocumented.  Under the Obama administration, federal law enforcement agencies did not strongly enforce
federal cannabis laws nationally, although there is precedent for federal
actions on dispensaries and growers (Zilversimt, 2016).  Federal law typically enforces a 5-year prison sentence for cultivation sites larger than
99 plants, hence anecdotal evidence suggests that many farmers stay
under that number in case of federal intervention (California Normal,
2016).  Currently there is no organized program in California to track
cannabis cultivation siting, production, or sales, even in the legal market.  New laws passed in 2015 aim to establish such a system by 2018
(McGreevy, 2015).  The details of such laws are still under formation in
California, with the California Department of Food and Agriculture
(CDFA) releasing their ﬁrst proposed regulations on medical cannabis
cultivation on April 28, 2017.  From a land use perspective individual
counties will be able to create land use ordinances that limit production
beyond state standards. 
There is little documentation of actual practices of cannabis production in the scientiﬁc literature (Carah Name, 2015).  The lack of research
stems in part from federal restrictions on interacting with cannabis,
which have prevented researchers from observing and studying production systems (Sides, 2015).  Nevertheless, researchers have anecdotally observed several tendencies of cannabis production that are
relevant to our modeling exercise.  First, production takes place both
outdoors and in greenhouses.  Outdoor production is reliant on natural
sunlight and plants are typically grown in groups or individually in
raised beds.  Greenhouse production allows for light to be diminished
with shades or enhanced with artiﬁcial light.  The manipulation of light
allows growers to precisely control ﬂowering, which gives greater control over production in terms of both the schedule and the amount
produced. 
Cannabis requires water throughout its growing season, which takes
place during Humboldt County's dry season and can last up to
150 days. 2 Given Humboldt County's dry summers and falls, irrigation
of cannabis plants is needed on a nearly daily basis, with some estimates
suggesting up to 22 l per day per plant (Humboldt Growers Association,
2010).  Although not documented, it is likely that cannabis produced in
greenhouse settings may need less irrigation. 
Finally, for most agricultural crops, soil quality is a driver of crop
choice.  In Humboldt County, poor-quality agricultural soil covers
nearly 90% of the county.  Therefore, many growers import soil for
both outdoor and greenhouse grows.  While there is no documentation of how much soil is imported, various local businesses exist to
supply soil in large quantities (e. g.  www. humboldtnutrients. com,
www. royalgoldcoco. com). 
2. 3.  Data. 
We use a number of spatial datasets to parametrize our model. 
The main cannabis dataset is a reduced version of the dataset used
in Butsic and Brenner (2016).  The dataset used in this study includes
only cultivation sites in Humboldt County to control for any policy or
enforcement differences across county boundaries.  Our dataset documents cannabis cultivation sites on 1341 parcels (out of 14,462 parcels larger than one acre), with the majority of cultivation sites
recorded in 2012 and the remainder in 2013.  Of these 1341 parcels,
726 have greenhouse operations, 478 have outdoor grow operations,
and 137 have both.  The average production of each parcel is 180
plants, while the parcel with the most cannabis plants has 2794
plants (Table 1). 
We joined the cannabis dataset with several other spatial datasets. 
Parcel boundaries and zoning designations were provided by Humboldt
County.  We used the CalVeg (http. //www. fs. fed. us/r5/rsl/projects/
mapping/accuracy. shtml) vegetation layer to quantify the percent of
each parcel in different vegetation types.  The percent of each parcel
with over 30% slope was estimated using a digital elevation model
(DEM) provided by Humboldt County. 
A number of variables which describe the spatial location of a
parcel were created.  For each parcel we calculated the distance to
the Paciﬁc Ocean and the meters north.  Humboldt County receives
dense fog near the Paciﬁc Ocean, so growers might hypothetically
locate farther from the ocean to obtain more sunlight.  Also provided
by Humboldt County was a map of maintained roads.  We used
the dataset to calculate the distance from a parcel edge to a developed road.  We calculated the distance of each parcel to the
nearest water source, based on data provided by the California
Department of Fish and Wildlife (https. //www. wildlife. ca. gov/
Data/GIS/Clearinghouse).  For each parcel we also calculated the
number of plants within 100 m and 500 m of its boundary in
order to identify parcels that were located in clusters of cultivationFinally, we were interested in the historical land use of each parcel,
especially whether or not a parcel had been logged in the last
15 years.  A common narrative is that areas where timber was produced
in the past are often converted into cannabis cultivation sites.  In California, Timber Harvest Plans (THP) are required for the harvest of merchantable timber on private lands.  Landowners, either individuals or
ﬁrms, apply for plan approval and once approval is granted, timber harvest can commence.  Once timber is cut, it is usually replanted.  However,
it may be the case that some landowners are not replanting but
converting to cannabis.  This may be economically efﬁcient as the land
cleared by timber harvest may be less expensive to convert to cannabis
since trees are already removed from this area.  We used the Timber
Harvest Plan database provided by the State of California to document
for each parcel the percent of land that was permitted to be harvested
since 1997 (Table 2). 
2. 4.  Intuition Behind Spatial Location and Size of Cultivation Sites. 
Our goal was to estimate what factors inﬂuenced two decisions on
the part of cannabis growers.  First we wanted to know where cannabis
cultivation sites were most likely to be located.  Typical economic
models of land use focus on the expected net returns to different
crops to model the decision of where cropland will expand.  Much of
the intuition from these models may hold true in our case as well.  We
expect that parcels with better growing conditions – more sunlight,
less slope, nearer to sources of irrigation – would produce higher
returns, and thus we would expect these to be more likely to support
cannabis production. 
Cannabis differs from other crops in important ways, particularly the
ambiguous nature of its legal status.  production is licit and socially accepted, but federally illegal (Short Gianotti Name, 2017).  Therefore, we
anticipate that producers likely cultivate in areas where the risk of law
enforcement activities is relatively low.  In years past, when strict enforcement was in place, legal considerations incentivized growers to locate far from developed properties on lands that would be hard for law
enforcement personnel to visit (Corva, 2014).  Thus, we hypothesized
cultivation sites to be in remote locations, even though these sites
may actually be less suitable physically for growing cannabis. 
While the illegality of cannabis provides incentives for remoteness
in the location of cultivation sites, several factors could give rise to spatial clustering.  One such factor is information ﬂows.  A distinction between cannabis production and other agricultural commodities is the
lack of formal training and educational resources available to cultivators.  Cannabis producers cannot avail themselves of university courses
or cooperative extension services.  Therefore, producers have traditionally been left to develop their own techniques and networks to disseminate information.  For this reason, we expected that strong returns from
network effects would give rise to spatial patterns of cannabis production, where clustered growers could share knowledge and technologies
with each other. 
Further, the clandestine nature of cannabis marketing could promote the formation of geographically clustered distribution networks. 
While standard models of agricultural marketing emphasize transportation costs, high search costs stemming from the illegality of the industry
likely induce signiﬁcant frictions in the matching of cannabis producers
and distributors.  As a result, spatial clustering of growers may be of ﬁrstorder importance in the development of efﬁcient post-harvest cannabis
markets.  Similar search frictions might also arise in the labor
market—cannabis harvest is labor intensive, often requiring large numbers of ‘trimmers’—which also might provide incentives for spatial
clustering. 3 We therefore model the extent to which nearby cultivation
predicts the likelihood and extent of cannabis production. 
Finally, in densely forested areas of the county, we may expect that
cleared forest provide relatively low-cost areas for cultivating cannabis,
since a producer will not have to pay for land clearing.  This may be especially true after recent timber harvest.  Therefore, timber harvest in
the previous 15 years may predict areas where new cannabis cultivation
sites are located.  We chose the 15 year mark because digitized THP records exist back to 1997.  Likewise, after 15 years we would expect vegetation to have regrown to the point where gains from past clearings are
lost.  We measure this using the existence of an approved timber harvest
plan (THP). 4
2. 5.  Statistical Model. 
Our goal is to model the results for two joint decisions (1) Whether
or not to use a parcel for cannabis cultivation and (2) The number of
plants to cultivate.  Given that the outcome (the number of plants are
on a cultivation site) is conditional on selection (whether cannabis is
cultivated on the parcel or not) a model that does not account for sample selection may be biased.  The Heckman (1979) two-step sample selection estimator (i. e.  Heckit) is one way to account for this issue and
has been previously used in land-use change settings (Lewis Name,We assume an underlying regression relationship between the
number of plants on parcel j, yj and a set of covariates. 
In our case, the dependent variable yj is greater than zero only in the
case where cannabis is gown (1341 out of 14911 parcels over 1 acre). 
We can estimate the likelihood of a parcel growing cannabis (i. e. 
yj N0) as the selection equation 
where zj is a vector of variables that inﬂuence whether or not a parcel
produces cannabis and G, the coefﬁcients.  We assume the following
error structure. 
Correlation in the error terms of the equations reﬂect the degree to
which the unobserved factors that determine ﬁrst stage selection (i. e. 
the decision to grow) are linked with the second stage (i. e.  grow size)
residual.  When ρ=0, standard regression techniques will provide unbiased results.  If this is not the case, the outcome equation will be biased
due to the omission of a key regressor.  The Heckman model, which recovers an estimate of the missing regressor using the Inverse Mills
Ratio (IMR) from the ﬁrst stage Probit estimate of the selection equation, provides consistent asymptotical efﬁcient estimates for model parameters when the errors of the two equations are correlated. 
We applied the Heckman model to our suite of variables.  The dependent variable of the selection equation is whether or not a parcel has a
cultivation site.  The dependent variable of the outcome equation is the
log of the number of plants grown. 
There is a long debate regarding the importance of exclusion restrictions (i. e.  variables that inﬂuence the selection equation but not the outcome equation) when estimating Heckman models.  In the absence of
such restrictions (i. e.  xj = zj), the non-linearity of the IMR from the
ﬁrst stage equation is the source of identiﬁcation.  In the presence of
high collinearity between the IMR and the regressors, however, sole reliance on such a functional form assumption results in unreliable estimates of the outcome equation (Leung and Yu, 1996.  Madden, 2008). 
In our data, we indeed found quite high collinearity between the IMR
and the regressors (Cameron and Trivedi, 2005). 5 As a result, we utilized
the zoning status of parcels as a further source of identiﬁcation in the
outcome equation.  We ran the model where zoning variables are included in the selection equation but not the outcome equation.  We justify these exclusion restrictions by noting that the zoned status of the
parcel may inﬂuence the suitability of a site for any cultivation.  for instance if a parcel is zoned for commercial use it is unlikely to be a
good site for outdoor cannabis production.  However, if a person decides
to produce on a site, zoning is unlikely to impact the size of the cultivation site, as zoning did not legally limit cannabis production on any parcels at the time of data collection. 
To estimate the model, we used a suite of independent variables that
include biophysical properties of a parcel (slope, nearness to a water
source, southward facing), vegetation type (% in shrub, herbaceous, barren, coniferous forest, hardwood forest, and mixed forest), spatial location (distance from road, distance from nearest city, distance from
ocean, m north) administrative (zoning), historical (had there been a
THP on the property in the last 15 years), and network (the log of the
number of plants within 100 m of a parcel). 
In order to focus on parcels with potential production, we restrict
our sample to parcels greater than one acre and parcels that were not
protected (i. e. , public parks, National Forest, Nature Conservancy
lands, etc. ). 6,7 In addition to the main speciﬁcation, we also run separate
regressions for outdoor and greenhouse production.  These models
allow us to determine the extent to which site selection and production
intensity decisions differ by production methods with respect to our explanatory variables.  Because an important variable of interest, the number of grows on neighboring parcels, may be endogenous, we also
examine the robustness of the results using a control function approach.
