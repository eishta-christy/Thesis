 1.  Introduction  In the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (hereafter, the “Dodd–Frank Act”), policymakers made an unprecedented move towards using securities regulation to address issues unrelated to the Securities  and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) core mission of protecting investors and maintaining the fair and eﬃcient functioning  of ﬁnancial markets ( Lynn, 2011 ).  Section 1503 of the Dodd–Frank Act requires SEC-registered ﬁrms to include information regarding mine-safety performance in their ﬁnancial reports.  In this paper, we examine the real effects (i. e. , changes  in mining-related citations, injuries, and labor productivity) of the mandatory inclusion of mine-safety disclosures in the  ﬁnancial reports (“MSD”) of the 151 SEC-registered ﬁrms whose ownership of a U. S.  mine make them subject to Section  1503 of the Dodd–Frank legislation.  A key feature of our setting is that the information provided through MSD is already  publicly available on the Mine Safety and Health Administration’s (MSHA) website.  this allows us to isolate and estimate  the magnitude of the incremental real effects of including information in ﬁnancial reports.   Section 1503 of the Dodd–Frank Act requires reporting citations for violations of mine-safety regulations both periodically in mine owners’ ﬁnancial reports (i. e. , Forms 10K and 10Q) and immediately upon the receipt of an imminent danger  order (IDO) through a Form 8K ﬁling.  MSD advocates make the implicit argument that including this information in ﬁnancial reports has implications that such information does not have when only disclosed on the MSHA website.
