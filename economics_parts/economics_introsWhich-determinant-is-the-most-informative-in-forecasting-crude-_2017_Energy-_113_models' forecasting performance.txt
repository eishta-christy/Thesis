 1.  Introduction Explaining the main determinants and improving the forecast accuracy of crude oil market volatility are crucial to market investors and government decision makers.  However, forecasting oil volatility is an intractable task, as the crude oil market is quite complex and has various uncertain determinants, such as global oil supply and demand, OPEC spare capacity levels, ﬁnancial crises, and national elections.  Some studies have claimed that oil price change relies heavily on oil demand and supply, especially global demand (i. e. , Dées et al. , 2007.  Kilian, 2009.  Mu and Ye, 2011).  However, other studies have argued that a speculative component plays a key role (Zhang, 2013.  Hamilton and Wu, 2014.  Kilian and Murphy, 2014.  Juvenal and Petrella, 2015.  Gogolin and Kearney, 2016).  Liu et al.  (2016) disentangle the contributions of oil demand, supply, and speculation in real oil prices, whereas Yin and Zhou (2016) identify the role of speculation and economic fundamentals in driving oil price volatility.  However, as in the seminal work of Baker et al.  (2013) on measuring economic policy uncertainty (EPU), it is worth mentioning that many studies have examined the effect of EPU on the stock market and have considered EPU indices in forecasting stock market returns (Pastor and Veronesi, 2012.  Antonakakis et al. , 2013.  Kang and Ratti, 2013.  Tsai, 2017).  The literature about EPU's impact on the oil market is growing in recent years (e. g. , Aloui et al. , 2016.  Balcilar et al. , 2016.  Yin, 2016).  For example, Aloui et al.  (2016) hold that the movements in uncertainty index can identify the supply-side, aggregate-demand, and oil-speciﬁc demand shocks, that directly drive the oil price.  Thus, an increase (decrease) in the uncertainty index probably negatively (positively) affects the economy, which in turn reduces (increases) the demand and supply of crude oil and then cause oil price volatility.  Balcilar et al.  (2016) also emphasize that EPU can drive the oil price ﬂuctuations.  We conjecture that a high EPU can cause serious divergence in the expectations of oil consumers, producers, and speculators simultaneously and thus affect the demand, supply, or speculation stock for crude oil.  Therefore, EPU may comprehensively involves various information such as oil shocks, ﬁnancial crisis, and political events that greatly impact the oil market and cause oil price volatility.  However, it is not clear whether EPU is the most informative factor in forecasting oil volatility, and which determinant is the most powerful remains to be addressed.  This study is speciﬁcally related to the literature on the determinants of oil market return or volatility (e. g. , Dées et al. , 2007.  Kilian, 2009.  Mu and Ye, 2011.  Conrad et al. , 2014.  Hamilton and Wu, 2014.  Kilian and Murphy, 2014.  Gogolin and Kearney, 2016) and the predictability of EPU indices in asset return or volatility (e. g. , Pastor and Veronesi, 2012.  Antonakakis et al. , 2013.  Kang and Ratti, 2013.  Tsai, 2017).  We address two questions.  First, is EPU helpful for forecasting crude oil market volatility.  Second, which determinant is most informative and helpful in forecasting spot oil volatility—oil demand, supply, speculation, or the novel EPU index.  To answer these questions, we consider two newly released global EPU (GEPU) indices and six countryspeciﬁc EPU indices from major oil consumers and producers worldwide.  This allows us to investigate whether these new indices help in forecasting oil volatility and to compare their predictabilities with those of traditional determinants.  Regarding the models for forecasting asset volatility, GARCH and its extensions have been popularly used in empirical analyses (e. g. , Bollerslev, 1987.  Glosten et al. , 1993.  Cheong, 2009.  Mohammadi and Su, 2010.  Nomikos and Andriosopoulos, 2012.  Charles and Darné, 2014.  Eﬁmova and Serletis, 2014).  However, most of these models are strictly limited to imputing data at the same frequency.  Ghysels et al.  (2004) introduce mixed data sampling (MIDAS) regression models, which successfully address the data frequency problem.  To overcome the defect of GARCH-class models, Engle et al.  (2013) incorporate the MIDAS technique with the GARCH model, forming the GARCH-MIDAS model, which allows macroeconomic determinants to be incorporated at different sampling frequencies.  Conrad et al.  (2014) use the GARCH-MIDAS model to investigate the oil volatility with respect to the stance of the U. S.  macroeconomy but they focus on insample evidence.  Combination methods have also been argued to achieve stable forecast ability (Stock and Watson, 2004).  They can be categorized as constant combined models and time-varying combination methods.  Speciﬁcally, Raftery et al.  (2012) develop the dynamic model averaging (DMA) technique, which Liu et al.  (2017) successfully apply as a time-varying combination method to forecast volatilities of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil futures, accounting for both parameter and model uncertainty.  We construct 11 individual GARCHMIDAS models and three DMA model combinations with various determinants.  Although both Conrad et al.  (2014) and our study involve the determinants of oil price volatility.  However, our innovation is quite different from theirs in several ways.  First, based on the controversy in crude oil market, we aim to address the question which determinant is most informative and helpful in forecasting spot oil volatility, i. e. , oil demand, supply, speculation, or the novel EPU indices.  Whereas, the main contribution of Conrad et al.  (2014) provide the ﬁrst evidence on the link between U. S.  economic activity and the daily oil-stock correlation.  They examine whether the long-term oil and stock market volatility, as well as oil-stock correlation respond to the same macroeconomic information, especially, the oil-stock correlation.  Second, due to the different aims, Conrad et al.  (2014) consider the determinants that contain information on current and future U. S.  economic activity.  Unlike those determinants, we are the ﬁrst to integrate both the global economic policy uncertainty (GEPU) indices and several national economic policy uncertainty (EPU) indices with traditional determinants, such as global oil demand, supply, and speculation.  Third, unlike Conrad et al.  (2014), this study mainly concerns the models' out-of-sample performance.  We make two contributions.  First, we are the ﬁrst to consider various EPU indices, especially the GEPU indices and the country-speciﬁc EPU indices from major oil consumers and exporters, and the traditional determinants in forecasting crude oil market volatility.  Aloui et al.  (2016) suggest that EPU indices can identify three types of shock on oil prices (i. e. , supply-side, aggregate, and oil-speciﬁc demand).  Furthermore, we argue that EPU not only inﬂuences oil demand-supply fundamentals, but also changes market participants' sentiments, giving rise to speculation activities, and thus may contain more information and achieve better oil volatility forecasting accuracy than commonly used determinants.  Our empirical study provides an overview of the EPU indices and traditional determinants in forecasting oil volatility.  Second, we model daily oil volatility using a GARCH-MIDAS model with different monthly determinants.  To provide the time-varying effects of the determinants, we also apply DMA combination methods, allowing both a set of determinants and their coefﬁcients to change over time.  Furthermore, the models' forecasting performance is evaluated using the robust advanced model conﬁdence set (MCS) test (Hansen et al. , 2011).
