The link between competition and innovation has been a very
active topic in industrial organization.  It goes back to the indirect
debate between Arrow (1962) and Schumpeter (1942) centering
around the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis, which brieﬂy stated
says that one should expect to observe an inverse relationship
between innovation and the intensity of competition or market
structure. 
On the one hand, there are several arguments supporting the
view that possession of market power should result in greater innovative activities (Schumpeter, 1942).  First, market power may be
extendable to new products, for example, through a dominant ﬁrm’s
command over channels of distribution, and so on.  With the ability
to extend market power to new products, an incumbent monopolist should ﬁnd innovation more attractive.  Second, there may be a
need to ﬁnance innovation internally, which puts ﬁrms with market power at an advantage since these ﬁrms may have supernormal
proﬁts.  Third, ﬁrms with current market power typically have more
resources and thus are more likely to hire the most innovative people.  Of course the third argument is related to the imperfect capital
market argument underlying the second reason. 
On the other hand, there are arguments for the opposite view,
supporting the view that a monopolist can have reduced incentives to innovate.  Arrow (1962) shows that a competitor can proﬁt
more than a monopolist from innovation, and the monopolist may
be slower in replacing it with a superior product or process than a
newcomer.  This is because the ﬁrm realising monopoly proﬁts on its
current product calculates the proﬁt from innovation as the difference between its current proﬁts and the proﬁts it could realise from
the new product, whereas the competitor regards the proﬁts from
the new product as the gain.  As such, the larger current monopoly
proﬁts are, the less incentive the monopolist has to innovate.  Moreover, a monopolist may regard additional leisure as superior to
additional proﬁts.  This may be due to the lack of active competitive
forces and thus generates an x-ineﬃciency effect. 
The lively debate on the relationship between competition and
innovation in the industrial organization literature is still open and
systematically predicts a monotone relationship in either direction
between competition and innovation. 1 In clear contrast, Aghion Name
(2005) provide evidence of an inverted-U relationship between innovation and competition.  Their theoretical explanation is based on a
neo-Schumpeterian endogenous growth model (Aghion Name, 1997),
in which both technological leaders and followers in any industry can innovate, and innovations occur as a step-by-step process. 2
Innovation incentives depend upon the difference between postinnovation and pre-innovation rents of incumbent ﬁrms.  In this case,
more competition may foster innovation and growth, because it may
reduce a ﬁrm’s pre-innovation rents by more than it reduces its
post-innovation rents. 
One aspect that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been considered is the relationship between competition and innovation in a
polluting (or energy intensive) industry where R&D investment aims
to reduce the environmental footprint of production.  This is the purpose of the present paper.  In particular, we bring together the debate
on the relationship between competition and innovation with the
environmental economics debate on the optimal policy for pollution
control, concentrating on one policy instrument, an emission tax. 
Currently the main three major inﬂuences on ﬁrms’ R&D investment
are a focus on cleaner technologies, demand for renewable or sustainable energy and climate change,3 and they are further fuelled by
environmental regulation and international agreements on climate
change and the like. 4 In this context, “green” R&D can be seen as
a tool that ﬁrms can use to improve the cost imposed on them by
environmental regulation. 
We verify the presence of an inverted-U relationship between
competition and innovation in a microeconomic setting of oligopolistic competition where production is polluting and innovation results
in reducing emissions (abatement or, “green” R&D).  Given the presence of Pigouvian (emission) taxation, reducing pollution would
reduce production costs. 5 We present an n-ﬁrm oligopoly model
where ﬁrms compete in quantities and decide their investment in
“green” R&D, and where spillovers in R&D are present.  We establish
the link between competition and “green” innovation through the
variation of aggregate investment in R&D according to the number
of ﬁrms in the industry.  a greater number of ﬁrms in the industry
proxies increased competition and a concomitant reduction in market power (Sutton, 1998). 6 We show that the relationship between
competition and “green” R&D is represented by an inverted-U and
that this result is driven mainly by the presence of R&D spillovers
(appropriability problem).  The results obtained by Aghion Name
(2005) are thus conﬁrmed in a microeconomic framework where
innovation has the aim of abating polluting emissions. 
The paper is also related to the literature on organisational structure of environmental R&D (e. g. , Scott, 1996.  Chiou and Hu, 2001. 
Petrakis and Poyago-Theotoky, 2002.  Sandonís and Mariel, 2004. 
Poyago-Theotoky, 2007.  Golombek and Hoel, 2008).  With this literature, we share the assumption of R&D efforts being directed
not towards process or product enhancement, but directed towards
emission reduction of harmful pollutants.  The analysis in the paper
is close to Poyago-Theotoky (2007), who examines the issue of R&D
cooperation versus competition in a polluting industry where two
ﬁrms operate and endogenous taxation is set by a time-consistent
regulator.  Compared to Poyago-Theotoky (2007), we set aside the
R&D cooperation issue.  instead we consider an oligopoly rather
than a duopoly, and we focus on the case in which the regulator is
able to commit credibly to the setting of the environmental policy
instrument.  Finally, we assume that abatement is of the end-of-pipe
variant. 
Finally, the paper is related to the literature of innovation and
market structure.  Hausman and MacKie-Mason (1988) argued that
the actions of monopolies with regard to third-degree price discrimination, may lead to social welfare improvement due to opening
new markets, achieving economies of scale and higher eﬃciency and,
importantly, increasing net social welfare.  Geroski (1990) shows that
innovating may be a way to obtain market power, in particular he
ﬁnds that innovation increases the degree of competition in markets. 
This leads to a fall in market concentration over time and eventually
to the emergence of very few and large ﬁrms.  Therefore ﬁrms innovate with the aim to become incumbents.  Etro (2004) shows that
the innovative process is naturally connected to the persistence of
monopolies.  Their investment in research and development would
be beneﬁcial to society as they advance new technologies.  Our paper
contributes to this strand by focussing on innovation with “green”
features. 
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.  In Section 2
we present the model, in Section 3 we carry out the analysis and
establish the results and in Section 4 we provide concluding remarks. 
Proofs of propositions are in the Appendix. 
<Middle> The model. 
Consider an oligopoly market with n identical proﬁt-maximising
ﬁrms competing à la Cournot-Nash.  Firms supply a homogeneous
good, with market demand given by p = a − Q.  a is a positive constant parameter measuring the reservation price (alternatively, it is ameasure of the size of the market) and Q =
i=1 qi is total industry
output, i = 1, .  .  .  , n.  Production generates pollution, which is taxed
at the emission tax rate t, while ﬁrm i can reduce its tax burden
by undertaking environmental (“green”) R&D, zi, to reduce its emissions.  The cost function for ﬁrm i is additive separable and is given
by c (qi, zi) = cqi + cz2
i /2, where c is the unit cost of production,
a > c, andc > 0 is a parameter capturing the eﬃciency of the R&D
R&D, z(t) =t /c.  Evidently, ﬁrms respond to an increase in the
emission tax by increasing their “green” R&D.  Notice also that the
emission tax acts as an incentive for ﬁrms undertaking abatement, as
in the absence of emission taxation there would be no “green” R&D. 
Aggregate R&D is therefore. 
Clearly, total R&D increases monotonically with the number of
ﬁrms for a ﬁxed emission tax.  Hence, if taxation were exogenous, we
obtain a clear-cut Arrowian result.  Increased competition (higher n)
leads to an increase in aggregate R&D (innovation). 
In the ﬁrst stage, the regulator sets the emission tax so as to maximise social welfare, deﬁned as total surplus minus production costs,
R&D costs and environmental damages. 
Substituting the ﬁrm’s output q(t) and R&D effort, z(t) into the above
expression we obtain total welfare as a function of the emission tax. 
From the ﬁrst-order condition of Eq.  (4) we obtain the optimal
emission tax 
where b ∈ [0, 1] represents R&D spillovers, i. e.  there are spillovers
in environmental R&D in that a ﬁrm beneﬁts not only from its own
R&D effort but also from its rivals’ effort by an amount b. 9 We denote
aggregate R&D as Z =
i=1 zi and the total R&D expenditure as
cZ2/2.  Hence, ﬁrm i(cid. 5)s proﬁt is pi = pqi − c (qi, zi) − tei (qi, zi) , with
emission taxation a linear function of net emissions.  Total emissionsi=1 ei (qi, zi), and the damage function is a quadratic function of emissions, D = dE2, where d is a parameter capturing the
steepness of marginal damages or, the degree of convexity of the
damage function.  To guarantee interior solutions in what follows we
assume d > (1/2n) (see also, Petrakis and Xepapadeas (2001) and
Poyago-Theotoky (2007)).  This implies that environmental damages
are not insigniﬁcant for the economy. 
In the sequel we consider the case where the regulator precommits to the level of environmental policy, i. e. , the emission tax.  In
particular, we examine a three-stage game where.  in stage one, the
regulator sets the emission tax so as to maximise social welfare,
in stage two, ﬁrms invest in “green” R&D and in stage three market competition occurs. 10 The equilibrium solution concept is perfect
subgame equilibrium with backward induction.
