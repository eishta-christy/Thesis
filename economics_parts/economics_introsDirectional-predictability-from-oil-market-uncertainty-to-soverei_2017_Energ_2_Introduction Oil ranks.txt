 1.  Introduction Oil ranks among the most volatile non-agricultural commodities in the world and this volatility has increased in recent years due mainly to the recent global ﬁnancial crises, the surge in production of shale oil and the change in OPEC's policy from the quota mechanism to the market share maximization.  Oil prices dropped from $147/barrel in July 2008 to $32/barrel in March 2009 due particularly to the global ﬁnancial crisis of 2008–2009 and then climbed to more than $100/barrel in the ﬁrst quarter of 2011, rising in-line with the global economic recovery.
