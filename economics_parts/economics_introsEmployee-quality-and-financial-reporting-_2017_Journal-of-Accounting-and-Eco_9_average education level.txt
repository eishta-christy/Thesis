1.  Introduction  Following a series of accounting scandals in the early 20 0 0s (e. g. , Enron and WorldCom), capital market participants  questioned how auditors and regulators failed to identify the misreporting.  However, in a comprehensive examination of  fraud cases from 1996 to 2004, Dyck et al.  (2010) ﬁnd that a ﬁrm’s employees identify and reveal fraud more often (17%  of the time) than both auditors (10%) and the corporate ﬁnance division of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  (7%).  Given that employees provide ex-post discipline of ﬁnancial reporting by helping uncover fraud after it has occurred,  a natural question is whether employees are able to impose ex-ante discipline on ﬁnancial reporting before violations take We examine whether the quality of a ﬁrm’s workforce is associated with ﬁnancial reporting quality.  We proxy for the  quality of a ﬁrm’s workforce in two ways.  (1) the average education level of the workforce in the Metropolitan Statistical  Area (MSA) where the ﬁrm is headquartered, and (2) the average education level of the workforce across all MSAs mentioned  2 Using these measures, we examine two broad research questions.  First, are highly educated  in the ﬁrm’s Form 10-K ﬁling.
