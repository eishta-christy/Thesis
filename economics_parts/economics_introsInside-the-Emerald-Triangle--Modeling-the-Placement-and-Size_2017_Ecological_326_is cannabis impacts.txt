Land-use conversions from forested and natural lands to agricultural
landscapes are a leading cause of biodiversity decline worldwide
(Gibson Name, 2011.  Laurance Name, 2014).  Agricultural conversions
also release large amounts of carbon and contribute signiﬁcantly to climate change (Mendelsohn and Dinar, 2009).  Economic models of agricultural land-use change have proved helpful in understanding the
ecological consequences of land conversion across multiple scales and
for many commodities (Lubowski Name, 2008).  These models can also
be used to predict the environmental impact of changes in agricultural
policy or prices (Lawler Name, 2014.  Polasky Name, 2008). 
Cannabis represents an emerging agricultural crop of economic and
ecological signiﬁcance (Carah Name, 2015.  Decorte Name, 2011).  Cannabis is now legal, either as a medicine or for recreational use, in over
half the United States and the federal government has signaled potential
shifts in its classiﬁcation of cannabis as well (National Conference of
State Legislatures, 2016).  The market for legal cannabis is already estimated to reach $22. 8 billion nationwide by 2020, approximately double
the value of wheat production (Arcview Market Research, 2014).  The
growth of this industry may lead to clearing of new land for agriculture
or the intensiﬁcation of already established sites. 
While many facets of cannabis production are not well documented,
there is ample evidence that cannabis production can have negative
ecological impacts (Carah Name, 2015).  For instance, illegal cannabis cultivation sites have been linked to rodenticide poisoning throughout
Northern California (Gabriel Name, 2012.  Thompson Name, 2014), and
to dewatering of streams due to irrigation practices (Bauer Name,
2015).  Many grows are located in areas of potential ecological impact,
such as on steep slopes, far from developed road networks, and near
habitat for threatened and endangered ﬁsh species (Butsic and
Brenner, 2016). 
Given its high economic value and potential impact on the environment, surprisingly little is known about the most basic spatial dimensions of this emerging agricultural activity.  Even less is known about
how cannabis farmers choose the location and size of their operations. 
Unlike most agricultural crops in the United States, which are mapped
and recorded by various government departments, the presence of cannabis agriculture has gone widely undocumented, with the exception of
police reports during the era of strong prohibition.  Recent advances in
the availability of high resolution satellite imagery have made it possible
to map cannabis farms at some times of the year across fairly broad spatial scales (Bauer Name, 2015).  One recent study (Butsic and Brenner,
2016) produced baseline data that could be used to model land-use
decisions on cultivation location and size.  With these insights,
policymakers, planners, and others charged with governing this emerging land-use activity might better prepare to mitigate anticipated environmental impacts. 
We use a dataset consisting of 1341 documented cannabis cultivation sites on private land in Humboldt County, California to
model the spatial location and production decisions of cannabis
farmers.  We evaluate the impact of biophysical variables (slope, distance from ocean, distance to water, vegetation cover, and aspect),
network variables (number of plants on nearby parcels), local regulations (zoning), and historical variables (whether or not a timber
harvest has taken place in the last 15 years) on producer decisions. 
In addition, we test to see if the impact of these variables differs for
alternative production methods (outdoor cultivation vs.  greenhouse
cultivation). 
<Middle> Methods. 
2. 1.  Study Area. 
Our study area consists of 54 randomly selected watersheds in Humboldt County, CA which are representative of the county as a whole
(Butsic and Brenner, 2016).  Humboldt County is located in northern
California (Fig.  1) along the Paciﬁc coast and is considered the leading
cannabis producing county in the United States, if the not world.  The
county is a mix of coniferous and hardwood forest with pockets of
open rangeland.  The study area is home to numerous threatened and
endangered species, including.  Chinook and Coho salmon, steelhead
trout, and the northern spotted owl (California Department of Fish
and Wildlife, 2015). 
Due to the steep terrain and poor soils, agriculture is limited to a
relatively small area of the county.  Livestock, dairy, and nursery
production are the largest agricultural sectors ($76, $61, $41
million dollars in sales in 2014) and make up over 95% of all
agricultural production by value.  Timber production contributes
another $72 million in direct sales (Humboldt County, 2015).  In
comparison, the wholesale value of cannabis production is likely
over $300 million, although no ofﬁcial ﬁgures exist (Butsic and
Brenner, 2016). 
2. 2.  Cannabis Production in Humboldt County. 
Cannabis can be legally cultivated in California for medicinal purposes, although the federal government still considers cannabis an illegal Schedule I drug (McGreevy, 2015).  Medical producers (recreational
marijuana will not be legal in California until 2018) must be documented care givers and can supply their crop either to individuals who have
physician approval to use cannabis or to dispensaries, which can sell
cannabis to patients.  During the time period of our study, there was virtually no chain of custody in the cannabis industry, and the supply chain
from growers to consumers was undocumented.  Under the Obama administration, federal law enforcement agencies did not strongly enforce
federal cannabis laws nationally, although there is precedent for federal
actions on dispensaries and growers (Zilversimt, 2016).  Federal law typically enforces a 5-year prison sentence for cultivation sites larger than
99 plants, hence anecdotal evidence suggests that many farmers stay
under that number in case of federal intervention (California Normal,
2016).  Currently there is no organized program in California to track
cannabis cultivation siting, production, or sales, even in the legal market.  New laws passed in 2015 aim to establish such a system by 2018
(McGreevy, 2015).  The details of such laws are still under formation in
California, with the California Department of Food and Agriculture
(CDFA) releasing their ﬁrst proposed regulations on medical cannabis
cultivation on April 28, 2017.  From a land use perspective individual
counties will be able to create land use ordinances that limit production
beyond state standards. 
There is little documentation of actual practices of cannabis production in the scientiﬁc literature (Carah Name, 2015).  The lack of research
stems in part from federal restrictions on interacting with cannabis,
which have prevented researchers from observing and studying production systems (Sides, 2015).  Nevertheless, researchers have anecdotally observed several tendencies of cannabis production that are
relevant to our modeling exercise.  First, production takes place both
outdoors and in greenhouses.  Outdoor production is reliant on natural
sunlight and plants are typically grown in groups or individually in
raised beds.  Greenhouse production allows for light to be diminished
with shades or enhanced with artiﬁcial light.  The manipulation of light
allows growers to precisely control ﬂowering, which gives greater control over production in terms of both the schedule and the amount
produced. 
Cannabis requires water throughout its growing season, which takes
place during Humboldt County's dry season and can last up to
150 days. 2 Given Humboldt County's dry summers and falls, irrigation
of cannabis plants is needed on a nearly daily basis, with some estimates
suggesting up to 22 l per day per plant (Humboldt Growers Association,
2010).  Although not documented, it is likely that cannabis produced in
greenhouse settings may need less irrigation. 
Finally, for most agricultural crops, soil quality is a driver of crop
choice.  In Humboldt County, poor-quality agricultural soil covers
nearly 90% of the county.  Therefore, many growers import soil for
both outdoor and greenhouse grows.  While there is no documentation of how much soil is imported, various local businesses exist to
supply soil in large quantities (e. g.  www. humboldtnutrients. com,
www. royalgoldcoco. com). 
2. 3.  Data. 
We use a number of spatial datasets to parametrize our model. 
The main cannabis dataset is a reduced version of the dataset used
in Butsic and Brenner (2016).  The dataset used in this study includes
only cultivation sites in Humboldt County to control for any policy or
enforcement differences across county boundaries.  Our dataset documents cannabis cultivation sites on 1341 parcels (out of 14,462 parcels larger than one acre), with the majority of cultivation sites
recorded in 2012 and the remainder in 2013.  Of these 1341 parcels,
726 have greenhouse operations, 478 have outdoor grow operations,
and 137 have both.  The average production of each parcel is 180
plants, while the parcel with the most cannabis plants has 2794
plants (Table 1). 
We joined the cannabis dataset with several other spatial datasets. 
Parcel boundaries and zoning designations were provided by Humboldt
County.  We used the CalVeg (http. //www. fs. fed. us/r5/rsl/projects/
mapping/accuracy. shtml) vegetation layer to quantify the percent of
each parcel in different vegetation types.  The percent of each parcel
with over 30% slope was estimated using a digital elevation model
(DEM) provided by Humboldt County. 
A number of variables which describe the spatial location of a
parcel were created.  For each parcel we calculated the distance to
the Paciﬁc Ocean and the meters north.  Humboldt County receives
dense fog near the Paciﬁc Ocean, so growers might hypothetically
locate farther from the ocean to obtain more sunlight.  Also provided
by Humboldt County was a map of maintained roads.  We used
the dataset to calculate the distance from a parcel edge to a developed road.  We calculated the distance of each parcel to the
nearest water source, based on data provided by the California
Department of Fish and Wildlife (https. //www. wildlife. ca. gov/
Data/GIS/Clearinghouse).  For each parcel we also calculated the
number of plants within 100 m and 500 m of its boundary in
order to identify parcels that were located in clusters of cultivationFinally, we were interested in the historical land use of each parcel,
especially whether or not a parcel had been logged in the last
15 years.  A common narrative is that areas where timber was produced
in the past are often converted into cannabis cultivation sites.  In California, Timber Harvest Plans (THP) are required for the harvest of merchantable timber on private lands.  Landowners, either individuals or
ﬁrms, apply for plan approval and once approval is granted, timber harvest can commence.  Once timber is cut, it is usually replanted.  However,
it may be the case that some landowners are not replanting but
converting to cannabis.  This may be economically efﬁcient as the land
cleared by timber harvest may be less expensive to convert to cannabis
since trees are already removed from this area.  We used the Timber
Harvest Plan database provided by the State of California to document
for each parcel the percent of land that was permitted to be harvested
since 1997 (Table 2). 
2. 4.  Intuition Behind Spatial Location and Size of Cultivation Sites. 
Our goal was to estimate what factors inﬂuenced two decisions on
the part of cannabis growers.  First we wanted to know where cannabis
cultivation sites were most likely to be located.  Typical economic
models of land use focus on the expected net returns to different
crops to model the decision of where cropland will expand.  Much of
the intuition from these models may hold true in our case as well.  We
expect that parcels with better growing conditions – more sunlight,
less slope, nearer to sources of irrigation – would produce higher
returns, and thus we would expect these to be more likely to support
cannabis production. 
Cannabis differs from other crops in important ways, particularly the
ambiguous nature of its legal status.  production is licit and socially accepted, but federally illegal (Short Gianotti Name, 2017).  Therefore, we
anticipate that producers likely cultivate in areas where the risk of law
enforcement activities is relatively low.  In years past, when strict enforcement was in place, legal considerations incentivized growers to locate far from developed properties on lands that would be hard for law
enforcement personnel to visit (Corva, 2014).  Thus, we hypothesized
cultivation sites to be in remote locations, even though these sites
may actually be less suitable physically for growing cannabis. 
While the illegality of cannabis provides incentives for remoteness
in the location of cultivation sites, several factors could give rise to spatial clustering.  One such factor is information ﬂows.  A distinction between cannabis production and other agricultural commodities is the
lack of formal training and educational resources available to cultivators.  Cannabis producers cannot avail themselves of university courses
or cooperative extension services.  Therefore, producers have traditionally been left to develop their own techniques and networks to disseminate information.  For this reason, we expected that strong returns from
network effects would give rise to spatial patterns of cannabis production, where clustered growers could share knowledge and technologies
with each other. 
Further, the clandestine nature of cannabis marketing could promote the formation of geographically clustered distribution networks. 
While standard models of agricultural marketing emphasize transportation costs, high search costs stemming from the illegality of the industry
likely induce signiﬁcant frictions in the matching of cannabis producers
and distributors.  As a result, spatial clustering of growers may be of ﬁrstorder importance in the development of efﬁcient post-harvest cannabis
markets.  Similar search frictions might also arise in the labor
market—cannabis harvest is labor intensive, often requiring large numbers of ‘trimmers’—which also might provide incentives for spatial
clustering. 3 We therefore model the extent to which nearby cultivation
predicts the likelihood and extent of cannabis production. 
Finally, in densely forested areas of the county, we may expect that
cleared forest provide relatively low-cost areas for cultivating cannabis,
since a producer will not have to pay for land clearing.  This may be especially true after recent timber harvest.  Therefore, timber harvest in
the previous 15 years may predict areas where new cannabis cultivation
sites are located.  We chose the 15 year mark because digitized THP records exist back to 1997.  Likewise, after 15 years we would expect vegetation to have regrown to the point where gains from past clearings are
lost.  We measure this using the existence of an approved timber harvest
plan (THP). 4
2. 5.  Statistical Model. 
Our goal is to model the results for two joint decisions (1) Whether
or not to use a parcel for cannabis cultivation and (2) The number of
plants to cultivate.  Given that the outcome (the number of plants are
on a cultivation site) is conditional on selection (whether cannabis is
cultivated on the parcel or not) a model that does not account for sample selection may be biased.  The Heckman (1979) two-step sample selection estimator (i. e.  Heckit) is one way to account for this issue and
has been previously used in land-use change settings (Lewis Name,We assume an underlying regression relationship between the
number of plants on parcel j, yj and a set of covariates. 
In our case, the dependent variable yj is greater than zero only in the
case where cannabis is gown (1341 out of 14911 parcels over 1 acre). 
We can estimate the likelihood of a parcel growing cannabis (i. e. 
yj N0) as the selection equation 
where zj is a vector of variables that inﬂuence whether or not a parcel
produces cannabis and G, the coefﬁcients.  We assume the following
error structure. 
Correlation in the error terms of the equations reﬂect the degree to
which the unobserved factors that determine ﬁrst stage selection (i. e. 
the decision to grow) are linked with the second stage (i. e.  grow size)
residual.  When ρ=0, standard regression techniques will provide unbiased results.  If this is not the case, the outcome equation will be biased
due to the omission of a key regressor.  The Heckman model, which recovers an estimate of the missing regressor using the Inverse Mills
Ratio (IMR) from the ﬁrst stage Probit estimate of the selection equation, provides consistent asymptotical efﬁcient estimates for model parameters when the errors of the two equations are correlated. 
We applied the Heckman model to our suite of variables.  The dependent variable of the selection equation is whether or not a parcel has a
cultivation site.  The dependent variable of the outcome equation is the
log of the number of plants grown. 
There is a long debate regarding the importance of exclusion restrictions (i. e.  variables that inﬂuence the selection equation but not the outcome equation) when estimating Heckman models.  In the absence of
such restrictions (i. e.  xj = zj), the non-linearity of the IMR from the
ﬁrst stage equation is the source of identiﬁcation.  In the presence of
high collinearity between the IMR and the regressors, however, sole reliance on such a functional form assumption results in unreliable estimates of the outcome equation (Leung and Yu, 1996.  Madden, 2008). 
In our data, we indeed found quite high collinearity between the IMR
and the regressors (Cameron and Trivedi, 2005). 5 As a result, we utilized
the zoning status of parcels as a further source of identiﬁcation in the
outcome equation.  We ran the model where zoning variables are included in the selection equation but not the outcome equation.  We justify these exclusion restrictions by noting that the zoned status of the
parcel may inﬂuence the suitability of a site for any cultivation.  for instance if a parcel is zoned for commercial use it is unlikely to be a
good site for outdoor cannabis production.  However, if a person decides
to produce on a site, zoning is unlikely to impact the size of the cultivation site, as zoning did not legally limit cannabis production on any parcels at the time of data collection. 
To estimate the model, we used a suite of independent variables that
include biophysical properties of a parcel (slope, nearness to a water
source, southward facing), vegetation type (% in shrub, herbaceous, barren, coniferous forest, hardwood forest, and mixed forest), spatial location (distance from road, distance from nearest city, distance from
ocean, m north) administrative (zoning), historical (had there been a
THP on the property in the last 15 years), and network (the log of the
number of plants within 100 m of a parcel). 
In order to focus on parcels with potential production, we restrict
our sample to parcels greater than one acre and parcels that were not
protected (i. e. , public parks, National Forest, Nature Conservancy
lands, etc. ). 6,7 In addition to the main speciﬁcation, we also run separate
regressions for outdoor and greenhouse production.  These models
allow us to determine the extent to which site selection and production
intensity decisions differ by production methods with respect to our explanatory variables.  Because an important variable of interest, the number of grows on neighboring parcels, may be endogenous, we also
examine the robustness of the results using a control function approach. 
Finally, we also face potential concerns stemming from the possibility that spatially autocorrelated errors exist in our data.  There are limited applications of Heckman models that correct
for spatially
autocorrelated errors and empirical results from these models show little bias reduction (Flores-Lagunes and Schnier, 2012).  Therefore, we
apply a sampling procedure where we create 300 samples from the
full dataset.  In each sample, parcels are at a minimum 200 m from
each other.  We run our models over these 300 datasets, and then average the coefﬁcients and standard errors.  This procedure should limit
spatial autocorrelation resulting from parcels located b200 m away
from each other.  The results of these averaged models were very similar
to the models run over the full dataset, but with larger standard errors. 
This is to be expected as the spatial sample limits the size of the dataset
for each model run to b4000 parcels. 
3.  Results. 
3. 1.  The Spatial Location of Cultivation Sites. 
Many biophysical variables that typically impact the spatial location
of agriculture had weak, yet statistically signiﬁcant, impacts on cannabis
grow location.  Both the percent of the property facing south and steep
slope reduced the likelihood of a cultivation site, at the 10% signiﬁcance
level.  The distance of a parcel to a water source did not impact the likelihood of a parcel's use for cannabis cultivation.  All else being equal, forested parcels overall were more likely to have cultivation sites than
non-forested parcels regardless of forest type (Table 3). 
The size of the parcel was an important predictor of the spatial location of cultivation sites, although the relationship between parcel size
and the likelihood of a cultivation site is likely non-linear.  Larger parcels
are more likely to have cultivation sites, but the negative sign of the quadratic term suggests that this positive association does not hold for very
large parcels (Fig.  2). 
A parcel's location within the county signiﬁcantly impacts the likelihood of cultivation.  Parcels that are further to the north are less likely to
have cultivation sites, as are parcels closer to cities and farther from the
ocean.  Proximity to roads also signiﬁcantly reduces the likelihood of cultivation, with a 1% increase in distance to a road increasing the probability of a cultivation site by 2. 3%.  The impact of a parcel having had a
timber harvest plan associated with it in the last 15 years did not appear
economically or statistically signiﬁcant. 
Current zoning appears more precisely correlated with farm location.  The coefﬁcients of forest recreational, agriculture (exclusive) and
unzoned land were all positive and signiﬁcant relative to the omitted
zone of “other”, which includes all zones that have b1% of parcels in
cultivation. 
Finally, proximity to other cultivation site also positively and significantly increases the likelihood that a parcel will have a cultivation site. 
A 1% increase in the number of plants within 100 m of a parcel boarder
raises the probability of cannabis production on a parcel by 2. 8%.  To better illustrate the impact of network effects, we predicted the probability
of a parcel having a cultivation site for plant numbers (within 100 m)
from 0 to 4600.  When there are no plants within 100 m of a cultivation
site, the probability of a parcel having a cultivation site is 4. 5%.  When
there are 200 plants within 100 m of a parcel, the predicted probability
jumps to 35. 7%, this effect steadily increases through 4600 plants, for
which the predicted probability of a parcel having a cultivation site is
66. 5% (Fig.  2). 
3. 2.  Size of Cultivation Sites. 
In contrast to its impact on the selection equation, a parcel's slope is
a strong predictor of cultivation site size.  The amount of slope over 30%
has a positive relationship with the number of plants cultivated on a
parcel.  However, distance to streams and the proportion of the parcel
facing south, which both theoretically inﬂuence the favorability of
growing conditions, do not appear to have a strong or precisely estimated impact on cultivation site size. 
However, the spatial location of a cultivation site does impact its size. 
Distance to ocean increases size in a statistically signiﬁcant manner,
likely indicating that growers have larger farms where there is less
fog.  At the same time cultivation sites that are closer to a city are likely
to be smaller.  Zoning and northness have no impact on cultivation siteThe size of a parcel always has a statistically signiﬁcant and positive
impact on the outcome model. 8 As in the ﬁrst stage selection equation,
the negative sign on the quadratic term indicates diminishing returns
to size for very large parcels.  The role of vegetation cover in predicting
the number of cannabis plants grown on a given site is more ambiguous.  forested parcels had slightly larger cultivation sites than non-forested parcels, but the estimated coefﬁcients are imprecisely estimated. 
However, a higher degree of shrub land is strongly negatively associated
with cultivation site size.  The impact of a parcel ever having a THP was
also negative, but imprecisely estimated. 
Finally, we ﬁnd that, in contrast to the selection equation estimates,
‘network effects’ do not appear to be a strong predictor of cultivation
site size.  The coefﬁcient estimate for number of plants within 100 m is
close to zero and not statistically signiﬁcant by any measure. 
3. 2. 1.  Differences between outdoor and greenhouse cultivation sites. 
Running separate regressions for outdoor and greenhouse plants reveals largely similar results with respect to site selection and production
intensity, but with a few important deviations (Table 4).  Notable differences emerge with respect to forestry history and zoning.  THP signiﬁcantly increases the likelihood of outdoor cultivation, but not of
greenhouse cultivation. 9 Agriculture exclusive zoning and “unzoned”
designation increase the likelihood of greenhouse cultivation sites, but
not of outdoor cultivation sites. 
There are differences in predictors of the size of cultivation sites as
well.  The relationship between high percentages of slope over 30%
and greater numbers of plants in the overall estimates is clearly driven
by greenhouse cultivation sites, not outdoor sites.  The same holds true
for parcels farther from the ocean.  Outdoor cultivation sites located farther north are predicted to be signiﬁcantly smaller than cultivation sites
in the southern part of the country, but the model shows an opposite,
though imprecisely estimated, relationship for greenhouses. 
3. 2. 1. 1.  Spatial Sample.  Finally, models built on the spatial sampling routine provide similar average estimates, but the coefﬁcients were less
precisely estimated.  For example, in the spatial model parcel size is
signiﬁcant and positive in the outcome equation, but the squared term
is not signiﬁcantly different from zero.  Both terms are signiﬁcant in
the non-spatial model.  Such results may be expected as the sampling
procedure greatly reduces sample size.  Importantly, perhaps the most
interesting result – the impacts of networks on siting – are still detected
in this model in a statistically signiﬁcant manner (Table 5). 
3. 2. 1. 2.  Control Function.  The estimation of both the main model and the
spatial sample suggest that the number of cannabis plants on neighboring parcels strongly increases the probability a given parcel will itself
host cannabis cultivation.  However, if there are factors unaccounted
for in our model that make cannabis production attractive on neighboring parcels, such as a favorable microclimate, the measured effect may
be biased upwards.  In particular, the endogeneity problem would suggest that the previously estimated positive coefﬁcient on the number
of plants grown on neighboring parcels cannot be interpreted as a direct
effect of neighboring cultivation sites, rather a result of this unobserved
feature favoring cannabis cultivation on multiple neighboring parcels. 
An unobserved variable that is unfavorable between clusters – such as
if clustered farms suffer from unfavorable pest or wind conditions –
could actually bias our estimates downward. 
To correct for the potential endogeneity problem, we employed a
control function approach (Lewis and Alig, 2014).  Our strategy relies
on the fact that observed physical characteristics of neighboring parcel
j should only affect cannabis production on parcel j, and not on adjacent
parcel i.  Therefore, the physical characteristics of a parcel j should serve
as valid instrument for the log of the number of plants on parcel j, as
they should not directly affect the existence of cannabis production on
parcel i.  To implement this strategy, we deﬁned an instrument that aggregates each biophysical and zoning variable used in the main estimate
across the neighboring parcels from which the network variable is
derived. 10 As in Wooldridge (2015), we recovered unbiased estimates
of the network variable, lnnp100, using a two-step procedure.  we estimate a ﬁrst-stage OLS of lnnp100 on the instruments, and then a second
stage probit of the main equation (i. e.  the ﬁrst stage selection equation
of the Heckman model) that includes functions of the residuals from the
ﬁrst stage.  As in Wooldridge (2015), we use several different speciﬁcations of the control function to check the robustness of the results to various functional forms.  Standard errors are obtained by bootstrapping
both steps. 
The results (Table 6) suggest that correcting for the endogeneity of
lnnp100 slightly increases the estimate of the effect on the probability
of cannabis production on a given parcel.  In all speciﬁcations, neighboring parcel characteristics appear to be ‘strong’ instruments for neighboring cannabis plants (F N 100).  Under the assumption that lnnp100 is
exogenous (i. e.  Table 3), our estimated marginal effect is 0. 028. 
Estimating lnnp100 without assuming exogeneity, increases the estimate to between 0. 041 and 0. 045, depending on the exact speciﬁcation
of the control function.  The coefﬁcients remain signiﬁcant at the 5%These ﬁndings do not support the idea that unobserved factors common to neighboring parcels are the primary driver of the observed positive inﬂuence of nearby cultivation sites on the probability of cannabis
cultivation.  In fact, given the higher estimated control function coefﬁcients, and the fact that the control function terms are signiﬁcant in
the second stage probit, these results indicate that the original estimates
may have suffered from downward bias.  Correcting for the fact that unobserved factors common to neighboring parcels may actually be unfavorable to cannabis production, proximity to neighboring cultivation
sites is an even stronger predictor of the location of cannabis cultivation. 
<Conclusion> Discussion. 
Cannabis agriculture is an emerging crop in many parts of the world
(Potter Name, 2011), and a force for landscape change in the United
States.  While other forms of agricultural change have been well documented with established theoretical and modeling frameworks, these
insights are lacking for cannabis agriculture.  As such, advances in the
understanding of decisions surrounding cannabis cultivation have potentially broad relevance.  We believe that our case has particular relevance to other situations—at least in the U. S. —because California has
historically played a leading role in the US cannabis industry and often
serves as a bellwether of policy changes anticipated in other states
(Weisheit, 2011). 
In this study, we quantiﬁed how a few selected physical and policy
variables drive cannabis producers' decisions regarding farm location
and size.  Our main ﬁndings show that biophysical drivers are less important to location choice for cannabis farmers than for other farmers,
and that network effects are strong.  Both ﬁndings suggest that social relations between farmers and other actors are important and research –
qualitative or quantitative – that addresses farmers directly is an important next step in understanding the broader impacts of this new crop. 
The locational choice of cannabis production is inﬂuenced most
strikingly through the impact of the number of plants grown in a
given parcel's neighborhood.  This result holds for both outdoor and
greenhouse cultivation sites.  The mean probability of a cultivation site
being located on a parcel jumps from b5% for a cultivation site without
any neighboring cannabis plants within 100 m to over 30% when 200
plants are located in the neighboring 100 m perimeter.  Controlling for
potential endogeneity of the placement of neighboring cultivation
sites via a control function approach does not diminish the estimated effect of neighboring plants. 
The large positive impact of neighboring sites on predicting cultivation within a parcel suggests strong network effects among producers. 
Given the lack of formal training and fractured input and markets, it is
likely that producer networks have been essential factors in the development of the industry, a conclusion supported by some of the historical
ethnographic work done in the area (Raphael, 1985).  Further, we believe that these network effects have played a role in determining landscape pattern and impacts. 
However, despite the evidence of clear spatial clustering of cannabis
production operations, the sizes of neighboring cultivation sites are not
strongly correlated.  These results suggest heterogeneity in farm types at
the time of our study that also seem to be consistent with the documented history of cannabis cultivation in the region (Raphael, 1985). 
Such mixing of small-scale cultivation sites with larger operations may
not hold in the future, as increased policy liberalization and a general
formalization and mainstreaming of the industry could facilitate consolidation among producers by reducing disincentives for growth. 
Many biophysical variables that commonly feature in crop choice
models are not important in the case of cannabis.  Our model predicts
that areas with steep slopes, poor irrigation access, and location far
from roads are just as likely places for cannabis cultivation as areas
more suited to conventional agriculture. 11 Likewise, we found that
cultivation sites that did take place on steep slopes were likely to be
larger than cultivation sites that took place on ﬂat land for both the
full dataset and for greenhouse cultivation sites.  This suggests that producers increased the size of their operations on account of factors different from those affecting conventional agriculture.  (For example, steep
slopes would disadvantage large-scale conventional crop production. )
We speculate that after decades of law enforcement, producers on
steep slopes, that are difﬁcult to access and navigate, perceive lower
risk of raids, and therefore enjoyed opportunities to grow their
operations. 
There are clear negative environmental consequences of such placement.  As has been documented elsewhere, this placement can lead to
excessive private road building, which is often associated with erosion
and stream sedimentation.  The unofﬁcial road-building and forest clearing that often accompany expanded cannabis production can also result
in signiﬁcant fragmentation of natural habitat.  We would hypothesize
that as liberalization continues, steep locations will be chosen less frequently for cannabis cultivation, and the location of large cultivation
sites will shift to less remote, more physically suitable locations.  Then
again, some local growers assert that Humboldt growing conditions,
typiﬁed by steep, remote mountain slopes, add to their product a certain
“terroir” value.  Future research could beneﬁt from directly interviewing
farmers about their decisions and applying either qualitative or quantitate methods to analyze such data. 
The clustering we note in our data may have positive or negative implications for the environment.  On one hand, clustering may diminish
the spread of cannabis into further remote areas of the County.  That is,
cannabis impacts may be localized by virtue of clustering.  On the
other hand, clustering may actually magnify the effects of these grow
operations, thereby intensifying local environmental impacts.
