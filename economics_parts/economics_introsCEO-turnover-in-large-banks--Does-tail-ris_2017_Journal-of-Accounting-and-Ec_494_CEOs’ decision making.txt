 It is widely accepted that the CEOs of large banks have incentives to implement business policies that increase their organizations’ exposure to risks ( Cohen et al. , 2014.  Ellul and Yerramilli, 2013.  Gandhi and Lustig, 2015 ).  These business policies  are motivated by the highly levered nature of banks that provides CEOs with risk-taking incentives given the convexity of  their stock and option holdings.   While shareholders are not against executives taking risks, because equity is an out-of-the-money call option whose  value is increasing with risk ( Acharya and Ryan, 2016.  Jensen and Meckling, 1976 ), they do not have a preference for risks  that can be detrimental to the survival of the bank ( Stulz, 2015 ).  A bank’s growing exposure to tail risks, measuring the  possibility of suffering extremely large losses, could be dangerous for the organization ( Cordella and Yeyati, 2003.  Ellul and  Yerramilli, 2013.  Hellmann et al. , 20 0 0.  Keeley, 1990.  Park and Peristiani, 20 07 ).  While an exposure to tail risks tends to  reward shareholders with positive returns in many scenarios, it can also be associated with a small probability of extremely  large losses that undermine a bank’s longer-term survival ( Cohen et al. , 2014.  Ellul and Yerramilli, 2013.  Thanassoulis, 2013 ).   The purpose of this paper is to understand whether increases in tail risk are associated with an increased likelihood of  a forced CEO turnover in large banks.  To this end, we present the ﬁrst cross-country study of CEO turnovers in the banking  industry based on a sample of 261 large banks selected from 46 countries for the period 2004–2013.   Whether any link exists between tail risk and the likelihood of a CEO turnover in large banks lacks empirical evidence.   This is particularly unfortunate given that dismissal is potentially an important mechanism to discipline CEOs by bank boards  and reduce the chances that they overly expose their banks to extreme risks.  In fact, dismissal might lead not only to the loss  of current employment but also the loss of unvested equity-based compensation ( Dahiya and Yermack, 2008 ) and reduced  future career opportunities ( Brickley et al. , 1999 ).   Our analysis is guided by conventional theoretical models proposed for non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms where boards employ performance, volatility and other signals to evaluate CEO choices ( Bushman et al. , 2010.  Gibbons and Murphy, 1990.  Holmstrom,  1982.  Jenter and Kannan, 2015 ).  When these signals indicate bad outcomes for the corporation that are imputable to a lack  of CEO ability or effort in the decision making, the dismissal of the CEO is a likely consequence.  Along these lines, we argue that tail risk conveys different and additional signals, as compared to stock performance and volatility, of possible bad  outcomes for the bank that can be related to CEO choices.   An increasing exposure to tail risks, making a bank more vulnerable to events that can lead to extremely large losses and  to a ﬁnancial distress ( Ellul and Yerramilli, 2013 ), signals that the bank might ﬁnd it more diﬃcult and costly to conduct its  business ( Stulz, 2015 ).  For instance, increases in tail risks lead to additional costs for shareholders related to the monitoring  role of bank creditors and regulators.  Both creditors and regulators do not beneﬁt from the upside gains deriving from bank  risk-taking while they bear the cost of the downside.  It follows that especially in the presence of a growing tail risk exposure,  creditors can signiﬁcantly increase the risk-premium charged on bank debts and reduce the amount of available funds for  the bank ( Flannery, 2001.  Schaeck et al. , 2011.  Stulz, 2015 ).  At the same time, regulators might more closely monitor banks  and offer negative signals on their ﬁnancial health with the consequence of reducing share prices and further increasing  borrowing costs ( Berger and Davies, 1998.  DeYoung et al. , 2001.  Slovin et al. , 1999 ).   In our study we follow Ellul and Yerramilli (2013) and Van Bekkum (2016) and use Expected Shortfall ( ES ) as our primary  measure of bank tail risk.  ES quantiﬁes the downside of bank risk in the form of extremely large negative stock returns.  ES  is, therefore, a particularly appropriate signal that a bank is overly exposed to extreme risks that are detrimental to bank  value.  Furthermore, following studies that investigate the role of volatility in CEO dismissal in non-ﬁnancial corporations  ( Bushman et al. , 2010 ), we build our analysis on the distinction between idiosyncratic and systematic tail risk, with the  former being seen as more directly linked to managerial choices.   By focusing on tail risk, our work is related to the stream of research that emphasizes the importance of going beyond  the investigations of (average) stock returns and proﬁtability in order to explain forced CEO turnovers in corporations (see,  for instance, Brickley, 2003 ).  This type of investigation is the focus of earlier studies on CEO turnovers in the banking industry (see Hubbard and Palia, 1995 ).  Furthermore, our paper extends and complements the analysis conducted on small US  community banks by Schaeck et al.  (2011) where the authors show that an increase in bank default risk (measured by the  accounting Z-score) raises the likelihood of a forced CEO turnover due to the disciplinary role played by shareholders.   Differently from the existing studies, we show the importance of accounting for tail risk in examining the decision to  remove a CEO by the boards of large banks.  We ﬁnd a positive relationship between idiosyncratic tail risk and forced (but not  voluntary) CEO turnover, and we document that the ﬁring decision is not, in general, related to an exposure to systematic  tail risk.  Furthermore, we show that our result is not related to idiosyncratic tail risk capturing a poor performance effect  or simply an idiosyncratic volatility effect, as in the model proposed by Bushman et al.  (2010) , and holds under different  empirical settings, including changes in the way we compute bank tail risk.   A key consequence of the above results is that the importance of idiosyncratic tail risk for the ﬁring decision should  depend on the banking market structure as the evaluation of CEO choices is argued to be more diﬃcult in more concentrated  (less competitive) industries ( DeFond and Park, 1999.  Fee et al. , 2013.  Yonker 2017 ).  This is because CEOs operating in  more concentrated industries are less likely to be subject to similar uncertainties ( DeFond and Park, 1999 ), have less peers  ( Brickley, 2003.  Fee et al. , 2013.  Yonker, 2017 ), and their outputs are more likely to be inﬂuenced by the actions of other  CEOs in the same industry ( Holmstrom, 1982 ).  Consistent with the view that the market structure inﬂuences the ability of  the boards to identify unﬁt CEOs, we ﬁnd that the sensitivity of forced CEO turnovers to idiosyncratic tail risk is lower in  more concentrated banking markets.   We next evaluate which stakeholders amplify the importance of tail risk for forced CEO turnovers.  In doing so, we contribute to the literature on how different bank stakeholders react to downside risks in banks ( Gandhi and Lustig, 2015 ).   We show that the sensitivity of CEO dismissals to idiosyncratic tail risk increases with a larger presence of subordinated  debtholders (namely debtholders that are liable to incur potentially larger losses in the case of a bank distress) or shareholders with lower diversiﬁcation opportunities.  In other words, there is a stronger relationship between idiosyncratic tail  risk and CEO dismissal in the presence of stakeholders that have more to lose in the case of distress.   The ﬁnal part of our analysis looks more closely at a bank’s exposure to systematic tail risk.  In the case of large banks,  there are speciﬁc factors that go against the argument that any exposure to systematic tail risk is completely unrelated  to managerial choices.  In particular, recent banking studies suggest that bank CEOs have incentives to manufacture nonﬁrm-speciﬁc tail risks and to engage in systematic risk-taking (modelled as an endogenous choice) to extract value from  the ﬁnancial safety net ( Acharya et al. , 2017 .  Acharya and Yorumazer, 2007 .  Adrian and Brunnermeier, 2016 .  Bushman and  Williams, 2015 .  Farhi and Tirole, 2012 .  Pennacchi, 2006 ).   To understand how boards perceive systematic tail risk in large banks, we test for the presence of variation in the sensitivity of forced CEO turnover to systematic tail risk when there are changes in the consequences a bank can suffer from  being exposed to this risk.  By using several alternative empirical settings, we consistently ﬁnd that there is a stronger  relationship between an exposure to systematic tail risk and CEO dismissal when such exposure is deemed to be more  costly for a bank.  For instance, we ﬁnd that the sensitivity of CEO forced turnover to systematic tail risk is signiﬁcantly  larger after a bank is included in the list of global systemically important ﬁnancial institutions by the Financial Stability  Board.  For these institutions, regulatory costs are linked to the systemic effects they produce (see Bongini et al. , 2015 ) and  the removal from the list only occurs when they no longer pose a global systemic threat.  All in all, our tests indicate that  the speciﬁcities of banks play a crucial role in the way bank boards see the exposure to systematic tail risk.   The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 discusses why tail risks should matter for forced CEO turnovers in  large banks.  Section 3 describes the sample, econometric methods and variables.  Section 4 examines the impact of a bank’s  idiosyncratic and systematic tail risk exposure on the likelihood of a CEO turnover, while Section 5 offers conclusions.   2.  CEO turnovers and the tail risk exposure of large banks  2. 1.  Tail risk as a signal of bad managerial choice  The existing literature offers little guidance on whether risk, and tail risk in particular, matters for the board decision  of large banks to ﬁre a CEO.  Studies on non-ﬁnancial corporations have mostly emphasized the importance of corporate  performance for CEO turnover ( Brickley, 2003.  Chakraborty et al. , 2007.  Engel et al. , 20 03.  Farell and Whidbee, 20 03.  Fisman et al. , 2014.  Guo and Masulis, 2015.  Hazarika et al. , 2012.  Jenter and Kannan, 2015 ).  An exception is Bushman et al.   (2010) who argue that, for a given level of corporate performance, a higher level of idiosyncratic volatility is associated with  an increase in the probability of a forced CEO turnover as it signals uncertainty about CEO talent.   Similarly, with the exception of Schaeck et al.  (2011) , who focus on the importance of accounting default risk for forced  CEO turnovers in US community banks, the limited number of studies on banks has only investigated the inﬂuence of  performance ( Hubbard and Palia, 1995 ) and the role of regulatory scrutiny on the turnover decision ( Palvia, 2011.  Webb,  2008 ).   In general, conventional theoretical models of CEO dismissal are built around the idea that boards assess the quality  of CEO choices on the basis of performance, volatility and other signals ( Bushman et al. , 2010.  Gibbons and Murphy, 1990.   Holmstrom, 1982.  Jenter and Kannan, 2015 ).  These signals lead to the dismissal of the CEO when they indicate bad outcomes  for the corporation and when these outcomes are due to a lack of CEO ability or effort in the decision making (bad choices).   Using this setting as a starting point, we expect that increasing a bank’s tail risk is associated with an increased likelihood of  a forced CEO turnover.  In other words, we postulate that tail risk offers signals of possible bad outcomes for the corporation  that are not contained in measures of performance and volatility and that are the result of CEO (bad) choices.   In respect to the above, the extant literature shows that a bank’s exposure to tail risks is conventionally seen as signalling  a risk exposure that may be excessive ( Cordella and Yeyati, 2003.  Ellul and Yerramilli, 2013.  Hellmann et al. , 20 0 0.  Keeley,  1990.  Park and Peristiani, 2007 ).  More precisely, shareholders want the CEO to take risks that are not detrimental to the  corporation ( Stulz, 2015 ), while an exposure to tail risks signals that a bank can be subject to extremely negative events that  might threaten its survival.  Furthermore, a growing exposure to tail risks can also affect the short-term value of the bank  by leading to funding restrictions by creditors (especially if they are not protected by deposit insurance) and to increases in  funding costs ( Flannery, 2001.  Schaeck et al. , 2011.  Stulz, 2015 ).   In addition, and differently from non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms, banks are subject to monitoring by regulators who are concerned  with the effects of bank tail risks on ﬁnancial stability.  An increased regulatory scrutiny due to tail risks has the potential  to negatively inﬂuence shareholder wealth in several ways.  Speciﬁcally, DeYoung et al.  (2001) show that supervisory inspections that convey bad news lead to an increase in the borrowing costs of large commercial banks, while Berger and Davies  (1998) and Slovin et al.  (1999) ﬁnd that negative regulatory assessments are associated with a decline in stock prices.  Moreover, in the presence of an excessive risk exposure, regulators have the power to prohibit certain bank activities, to dismiss  bank managers and even to close down the bank ( DeYoung et al. , 2001 .  Schaeck et al. , 2011 ).   In summary, an increasing exposure to tail risks ampliﬁes bank distress costs and leads to the probability of losses in  bank value caused by the monitoring role of bank creditors and regulators.  It follows that a board should consider ﬁring the  CEO whenever a growing exposure to tail risks is associated with a lack of CEO ability or effort in terms of risk-management.   2. 2.  Sources of tail risks and forced CEO turnovers  In understanding the drivers of the decision to ﬁre a CEO, conventional theoretical models of non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms highlight the importance of distinguishing the sources of a ﬁrm’s risk exposure.  CEO choices are normally expected to inﬂuence the idiosyncratic component, but not the systematic component of risk.  Accordingly, any type of systematic risk  (including tail risk) should be seen as a manifestation of an exogenous event and as such not relevant to the ﬁring decision.  This is highlighted by models of CEO turnover based on the relative performance evaluation framework ( Eisfeldt and  Kuhnen, 2013.  Jenter and Kannan, 2015.  Kaplan and Minton, 2012 ).  Further, using a different theoretical setting, Bushman  et al.  (2010) argue that, differently from idiosyncratic volatility, an increase in systematic volatility reduces the likelihood of  a forced turnover as it makes it more problematic for boards to infer indications of CEO talent.   There are, however, some speciﬁcities in the case of the tail risk of large banks that suggest some exposures to systematic  sources of risk may be related to CEO choices.  For instance, the presence of implicit and explicit government guarantees within the banking industry can induce bank CEOs to favor business policies that increase a bank’s exposure to systematic  tail risks or generate systematic tail risks (see Farhi and Tirole, 2012.  Pennacchi, 2006 ).  Speciﬁcally, Pennacchi (2006) argues  that banks are inclined to favor lending and off-balance sheet activities with high exposure to systematic risks, as these  business choices increase the value of their deposit insurance subsidy.  In addition, Bushman and Williams (2015) demonstrate that, via their loan loss recognition policy, bank managers generate tail risks that have negative implications for the  whole banking industry.  Similarly, Acharya et al.  (2010) argue that the global ﬁnancial crisis of 20 07–20 09 is primarily the  consequence of large and complex ﬁnancial institutions manufacturing systematic tail risks.   Nevertheless, the fact that exposure to systematic tail risk may be related to managerial choices does not necessarily  imply that this exposure should matter for bank CEO dismissal.  In fact, by increasing the exposure to systematic tail risks, a  bank can increase the probability of receiving a government bailout that transfers the bank’s losses to taxpayers.  This is because these losses materialize in periods when other banks are also in trouble and regulators intend to preserve conﬁdence  in the banking industry by avoiding bank failures ( Farhi and Tirole, 2012 ).  Furthermore, an increasing exposure to systematic  tail risks increases the probability of delaying the closure of a bank in distress, as the distress typically occurs in periods  when regulators aim to avoid panic (see e. g.  Acharya, 2009 .  Acharya and Yorulmazer, 2007 .  Bolton et al. , 2015 .  Brown and  Dinç, 2011 ).  It follows that an exposure to systematic tail risks may be perceived by bank boards as being less damaging  and dangerous than an exposure to idiosyncratic tail risks.   To summarize, the arguments indicating that bank boards should account for bank tail risk in the CEO ﬁring decision  should be primarily valid for the idiosyncratic component of this risk.  Differently from systematic tail risk, idiosyncratic tail  risk is not only more likely to be seen as a result of a lack of CEO ability or effort in managing risks but might also be seen  as more likely to be detrimental for shareholders and the bank.   <Middle> Data, econometric and variables.  3. 1.  Data.  The analysis is based on a sample of listed, large commercial banks and bank holding companies with accounting data  available from BankScope by Bureau van Dijk and market data available from Datastream International.  We select the sampled banks from an initial list that included the top 500 listed large commercial banks and bank holding companies in terms  of total assets at the end of 2004, as identiﬁed by BankScope.  Our sample period is from 2004 to 2013.  From this initial  list we retain only banks for which we are able to collect governance data (including data on CEOs) from annual and governance reports.  We also search for governance information from various relevant databases, such as Bloomberg, Business  Week, Forbes and S&P Capital IQ.  This reduces the sample size to approximately 300 banks.   As explained in the next section, our empirical model employs lagged explanatory variables to estimate the likelihood of  a CEO turnover.  Therefore, the ﬁrst CEO turnover event we record occurs in January 2005 and the last turnover occurs in  December 2013.  This results in an initial sample of 342 turnover events.  We then exclude turnovers where a temporary CEO  was appointed during a time of transition or turnovers that were associated with mergers occurring over the same period.   Next, we classify the remaining turnovers as forced or voluntary by conducting a manual search of news articles that  explain the reason for each outgoing CEO.  Our ﬁnal classiﬁcation follows Huson et al.  (2001) and Parrino (1997) .   Furthermore, to minimize classiﬁcation errors, we conduct additional investigations to validate whether the turnover was voluntary.   namely, explaining if it was motivated by retirement, resignation for personal reasons or to pursue a new business, or by  the outgoing CEO taking up another post in the same ﬁrm or a new job elsewhere.  Finally, we remove turnovers where no  reliable data could be found for the reason behind the CEO’s departure.   After imposing the described selection criteria, our ﬁnal sample consists of accounting and market data for 1994 observations (261 unique banks chartered in 46 countries) from 2004 to 2012 and includes 74 forced turnovers and 198  voluntary turnovers for the period 2005–2013.  Our sample size is similar to two recent cross-country studies that focus on  the cross-sectional relationship between bank governance and performance during the global ﬁnancial crisis (see Beltratti  and Stulz, 2012 .  Erkens et al. , 2012 ).  The proportion of forced turnovers is in line with the ﬁgures reported by studies on  non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms ( Bushman et al. , 2010.  Jenter and Kannan, 2015 ).   Panel A of Table 1 reports the sample distribution by country.  As in previous cross-country studies ( Beltratti and Stulz,  2012.  Erkens et al. , 2012 ), a large number of banks are concentrated in Japan and the US, representing 16. 75% and 16. 80% of  the total number of observations, respectively.  For the remaining countries, the share in terms of total observations does not  exceed 5%.  Panel B of Table 1 reports the distribution of turnovers by year and there is no obvious trend in CEO turnovers.   3. 2.  Econometric method  In our sample of CEO turnovers, there are two key CEO exit mechanisms.  1) forced 2) voluntary.  The two types of  turnovers are mutually exclusive and compete with each other as potential exit mechanisms for managers in a given bank.   Therefore, following Gregory-Smith et al.  (2009) and Hazarika et al.  (2012) and using the complete data about ﬁrms with no  CEO turnover, forced turnovers and voluntary turnovers, we adopt a competing risks hazard model to account for the fact  that forced turnovers are not the only exit mechanism for CEOs.   The dependent variable of the model is CEO tenure (deﬁned as the number of years a CEO held his/her chief executive  position) and all independent variables are lagged by one year to reduce simultaneity and endogeneity concerns.  Under this  empirical setting, the impact of each determinant varies for different types of CEO turnover.  We describe the covariates used  in our empirical analysis in the following sections.   3. 3.  Measuring bank idiosyncratic and systematic tail risk  Following Ellul and Yerramilli (2013) and Van Bekkum (2016) we use Expected Shortfall ( ES ) as our primary measure of a  bank’s tail risk exposure.  ES quantiﬁes the downside of bank risk in the form of extreme negative stock returns.   We estimate idiosyncratic and systematic ES using the historical approach based on realized returns.  The historical ap- proach relies on the assumption that the realized exposure to extreme risks offers valuable indications on the expected expo- sure to these risks.  In line with this view, Acharya et al.  (2017) show that measures of extreme bank risk computed before the crisis predicted stock performance during the global crisis.  ES is a common tool used in bank financial risk management ( Acharya et al. , 2017.  Yamai and Yoshiba, 2005 ) where the historical approach is widely applied.  For instance, Pérignon and Smith (2010) show that historical simulation is by far the most popular estimation method employed by large banks over the period 1996–2005 to quantify their exposure to extreme market risks.  More formally, for bank i, ES is (minus) the average daily return below the 5th percentile of the yearly distribution (see Ellul and Yerramilli, 2013 .  Van Bekkum, 2016 ) and can be expressed as this.  where R i,t is the daily stock return for bank i at day t and R αi,t is a bank’s daily stock return equal to the αpercentile (equal to the 5 th percentile in our analysis) of the year t distribution.  Conventionally, as shown in (1) , to compute ES the average of the daily stock returns in the lower tail of the return distribution is multiplied by minus one such that higher values of ES indicate a higher bank exposure to extreme negative returns.  However, as our predictions depend on the nature of a bank’s tail risk exposure, we need to estimate the idiosyncratic and systematic components of ES .  To this end, we start by extracting the idiosyncratic component of bank daily stock returns via the residuals of an augmented market model, where daily bank returns are regressed on market returns and industry returns (both based on domestic indexes provided by Datastream) as shown below, where R i,t is the return for stock i at time t , R m,t is the daily return for the market index for each country, R b,t is the daily return for the banking industry index for each country.  We then compute idiosyncratic (systematic) ES using the residuals (the predicted values) obtained from Eq.  (2) that captures the time series of idiosyncratic (systematic) returns.  As a result, following Eq.  (1) , Idiosyncratic ES is the average id- iosyncratic return below the 5th percentile of the yearly distribution of the residuals ( ˆ ε j,t ) from the market model.  Whereas Systematic ES is the average return below the 5 th percentile of the yearly distribution of the predicted returns from the market model.  Panel A of Table 2 reports summary statistics of our tail risk measures for three different groups of banks.  banks with no CEO turnovers, banks with at least one forced CEO turnover, and banks with at least one voluntary CEO turnover.  The mean idiosyncratic (systematic) ES for banks that experienced forced turnovers is 2. 25% (3. 50%), as compared to 2. 06% (2. 94%)  for banks with no turnovers and the difference is statistically signiﬁcant.  By contrast, the mean (median) idiosyncratic ES  and systematic ES for banks with voluntary CEO turnovers are not statistically different from those of banks with no CEO  turnovers.   3. 4.  Bank stock performance and volatility  Previous studies show that CEO dismissals are extreme forms of pay-performance sensitivity, where poor performance  leads to a greater likelihood of turnover ( Huson et al. , 2001.  Parrino, 1997 ).  As our tail risk measures are based on the yearly  stock return distribution, their impact on dismissal might then simply be the result of a poor performance effect.   In our empirical setting we, therefore, account for stock performance.  We construct measures of idiosyncratic and systematic stock returns based on the approach followed by Jenter and Kannan (2015) .  Speciﬁcally, we compute idiosyncratic  and systematic stock returns by annualizing daily values of predicted and residual stock returns using Eq.  (2) .   Despite tail risk and volatility being closely related, Rosenberg and Schuermann (2006) demonstrate that they can be  affected differently by bank decisions in terms of business mix and by the degree of correlation among different forms  5 Nevertheless, previous studies show that stock volatility matters for the ﬁring decision in non-ﬁnancial  of risk exposure.   ﬁrms (see, for instance, Bushman et al. , 2010 ).  Accordingly, we also control for a volatility effect by including in the model  idiosyncratic and systematic volatility components that we compute at a yearly frequency for the residual and predicted  returns from Eq.  (2) .   While Panel B of Table 2 reports summary statistics for our measures of stock performance and volatility, Panel C shows  their (Pearson and Spearman) correlation coeﬃcients with tail risk measures.  All tail risk measures show a relatively low  degree of correlation with measures of idiosyncratic and systematic performance, whereas they are clearly more correlated  6 In general, the correlation analysis conﬁrms that tail risk and volatility, though correlated,  with volatility components.   capture different features of a bank’s risk exposure.   3. 5.  Other controls  Panel A of Table 3 shows the other bank fundamentals that are potential determinants of CEO turnover (see Jenter and  Kannan, 2015 .  Parrino, 1997 .  Schaeck et al. , 2011 ).  We control for accounting performance, based on a bank’s ROA, since  a short-term proﬁt measure is usually a key predictor of CEO dismissal ( Fiordelisi and Ricci, 2014.  Parrino, 1997 ).  We also  include industry ROA since poor industry performance also results in an increasing CEO dismissal risk ( Jenter and Kannan,  2015.  Schaeck et al. , 2011 ).  We measure bank-speciﬁc accounting performance as a bank’s ROA minus the mean ROA of the  domestic banking sector ( Proﬁtability ) and include the mean ROA ( Industry Proﬁtability ) at the country level to account for  general (systematic) industry performance.   We control for the size of a bank ( Bank Size ) by the log of total assets (in thousands of US dollars).  Larger banks have a  bigger pool of talented executives to replace the existing CEO and this should lead to a larger probability of CEO turnover  ( Chakraborty et al. , 2007 ).  We also include bank size squared, as we ﬁnd evidence of a non-linearity in the relationship  between CEO turnovers and size.  Next, we control for the capital strength of a bank ( Bank Capital ), measured by the ratio  between the book value of equity and the book value of bank assets, and a bank’s charter value ( Charter Value ), measured  as the sum of the market value of a bank’s equity and the total book value of a bank’s liabilities all scaled by the book value  of a bank’s assets.  Lower equity capital and charter values (signaling lower growth opportunities) may trigger an increased  risk-taking and greater levels of regulatory pressure to replace poorly performing CEOs ( Schaeck et al. , 2011 ).   Panel B shows measures of bank internal governance and of external monitoring that can also impact the dismissal risk of  CEOs ( Laux, 2008.  Yermack, 1996 ).  For instance, smaller boards are associated with better performance and a greater threat  of CEO dismissal (see, for instance, Yermack, 1996 ).  More independent boards are expected to be more likely to challenge  and replace an underperforming CEO ( Laux, 2008.  Weisbach, 1988 ), although entrenched CEOs may exert power over the  board and reduce the likelihood of termination ( Berger et al. , 1997.  Hermalin and Weisbach, 1998 ).  Accordingly, we control  for the log of the number of board members ( Board Size ) and for the degree of board independence ( Independent Directors )  measured by the ratio between independent directors and total board members.  We include an index of CEO power ( CEO  Power ) based on the sum of two binary variables.  a dummy variable equal to one if the CEO was internally promoted and a  dummy variable equal to one if the CEO also serves as the chairman of the board.  We expect that more powerful CEOs are  less likely to be dismissed.   Next, we control for the percentage of shares held by insiders excluding the CEO ( Insider Ownership ).  Higher levels of  insider ownership result in internalizing the costs of bank default ( Booth et al. , 2002 ) and are likely to lead to a greater  likelihood of CEO dismissal ( Huson et al. , 2001 ).  However, higher levels of insider ownership could also lead to entrenchment  and reduce the level of monitoring and discipline of CEOs ( Denis et al. , 1997.  Goyal and Park, 2002 ).   CEO turnovers might also depend on the strength of the risk governance within a bank.  Risk committees (and the Chief  Risk Oﬃcer) evaluate and communicate to the board the impact of managerial policies on the risk-proﬁle of the bank ( Ellul  and Yerramilli, 2013.  Keys et al. , 2009 ).  We measure the strength of the risk-management function ( Risk Governance) as the  sum of two binary variables that take a value of one if there is a risk committee and if there is a Chief Risk Oﬃcer.   We ﬁnally control for two sources of the external monitoring of bank managers.  First, we control for the inﬂuence of bank  regulation ( Booth et al. , 2002.  Schaeck et al. , 2011 ) by including the general strength of the supervisory agency ( Supervisory  7 Second, we control for the  Power ) from Barth et al.  (2004) and the subsequent surveys conducted by the World Bank.   percentage of bank stock owned by institutional investors ( Institutional Ownership ).  Institutional shareholders can discipline  ﬁrm management by the threat of exit ( Admati and Pﬂeiderer, 2009.  Edmans and Manso, 2011 ) and are likely to show better  skills in assessing CEOs relative to their peers.   Finally, Panel C reports additional country controls.  The ﬁrst is the concentration of the banking market ( Bank Concentration ) measured as the log transformation of the Herﬁndahl index of bank deposits in each country.  In less concentrated  markets there could be a higher likelihood of forced CEO turnover, as board members can accurately benchmark CEO performance to peers and identify poorly performing executives ( DeFond and Park, 1999.  Goyal and Park, 2002.  Holmstrom,  1982 ).  Further, a more concentrated market might indicate a lower number of peers in the external market for executives,  with a consequent increase in the diﬃculty of replacing an incumbent CEO ( Fee et al. , 2013.  Yonker, 2017 ).   We then include a country-level index from the World Bank database on Doing Business ( Director Liability Index ) that  measures the power of shareholders to implicate directors for self-interested behavior.  We expect a greater likelihood of  CEO turnover in countries where shareholder power is higher.  We also control for the degree of regulatory restrictions  placed on bank activities ( Activity Restrictions ) from the World Bank regulatory dataset.  In countries with a more complex  banking business, bank boards could ﬁnd it more diﬃcult to understand a bank’s business model and the related signals for  the ﬁring decision.   Next, the GDP per capita ( Development ) accounts for the degree of economic development of a country that might affect  the monitoring ability of stakeholders and consequently the probability of forced turnovers.  We use the ratio between the  ﬁscal balance and country GDP ( Fiscal Capacity ) to capture the possibility that countries with a larger budget balance are  more likely to extend government guarantees to weak banks ( Brown and Dinç, 2011 ).  As in Houston et al.  (2010) , we also  control for country size ( Size of Economy ) through the log of domestic GDP in millions of US dollars to account for the fact  that a few large economies may be driving our results and for the inﬂation rate ( Inﬂation ).   4.  Tail risk and CEO turnover  4. 1.  Does a bank’s tail risk exposure matter.   We begin our empirical analysis by ﬁrst estimating a baseline speciﬁcation for the full sample of CEO turnovers with  idiosyncratic and systematic ES as the key explanatory variables and controlling for bank fundamentals (including stock  return and volatility components) and country characteristics.  We then extend the baseline speciﬁcation with the addition  of measures of internal and external monitoring mechanisms that might affect the ﬁring decision (column (2)).   The results, reported in Table 4 , provide consistent evidence that the hazard rate of a forced CEO turnover is positively  associated with idiosyncratic bank tail risk.  idiosyncratic ES enters all models with a positive coeﬃcient that is signiﬁcant at  The results, reported in Table 4 , provide consistent evidence that the hazard rate of a forced CEO turnover is positively associated with idiosyncratic bank tail risk.  idiosyncratic ES enters all models with a positive coefficient that is significant at customary levels.  8 In contrast, idiosyncratic and systematic ES are not significantly associated with the hazard of a voluntary turnover.  9 Hence,aCEO’sdecisiontovoluntarilyleaveabankisnotassociatedwiththebank’sexposuretotailrisk.  Our results for forced turnovers are also economically significant.  a one standard deviation increase in idiosyncratic ES leads to an increase in CEO dismissal risk by approximately 61% using the coefficients obtained from model (2).  10 Moreover, all these tests show that systematic tail risk does not influence CEO forced turnover. A possible interpretation of our ﬁndings is that an increase in the probability of a forced turnover might induce managers  to increase idiosyncratic tail risk as an extreme attempt to boost value.  However, the existing literature does not generally  show that an increasing risk of dismissal increases the risk appetite of CEOs.  In fact, Chakraborty et al.  (2007) shows the  contrasting result that corporate risk-taking increases when CEOs have a higher job security.  Furthermore, in the Online Appendix , similarly to Chakraborty (2007), we document that an increase in CEO dismissal risk is not associated with increases  in bank tail risk, including idiosyncratic tail risk.   The above test, however, does not rule out another possible interpretation based on Weisbach (1988) .  He observes that  stock returns incorporate the expectations that a CEO will be ﬁred.  Accordingly, the returns of a bank managed by a CEO that  will be ﬁred are higher than they would be otherwise.  The anticipation effect embedded in stock returns also inﬂuences tail  risk and volatility.  In essence, when the market anticipates a forced turnover, a bank’s return distribution changes leading  to tail risk and volatility being informative on CEO dismissal while stock returns are not (as in our analysis).  While in  Section 4. 2 , we show that our results remain valid when we employ an accounting based measure of tail risk that, as  argued by Weisbach (1988) , should be less affected by any anticipation effect, we acknowledge the diﬃculties in fully ruling  out an interpretation based on this effect.   Moving onto the analysis of the control variables, we ﬁnd that numerous variables are signiﬁcantly related to the likelihood of a CEO turnover in large banks.  Consistent with Bushman et al.  (2010) , we ﬁnd that idiosyncratic volatility is  positively associated with the likelihood of a forced turnover while it is not signiﬁcantly related to voluntary turnovers.   Furthermore, CEOs at large banks are more likely to experience forced turnovers.  Moreover, in most of the speciﬁcations,  CEOs at banks with higher capital ratios are less likely to be ﬁred or to voluntarily leave a bank, while higher charter values  (signaling more growth opportunities) are associated with a reduced probability of CEO dismissal.  The likelihood of a forced  turnover, but not of a voluntary turnover, is also lower in banks with a higher proﬁtability.   In terms of bank governance, as in the literature on non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms ( Del Guercio et al. , 2008.  Guo and Masulis, 2015.   Helwege et al. , 2012.  Parrino et al. , 2003 ), we ﬁnd that an increase in CEO power is associated with a reduced likelihood  of both forced and voluntary turnovers, while higher levels of institutional ownership are more (less) likely to be associated with a CEO being ﬁred (leaving voluntarily).  As far as country controls are concerned, similarly to DeFond and Park  (1999) and Goyal and Park (2002) for non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms, in most of the speciﬁcations we ﬁnd that the likelihood of a  forced turnover is negatively associated with the degree of banking market concentration.  Finally, forced turnovers occur  more frequently in more shareholder-oriented countries as indicated by higher values of the director liability index.   In general, the results of this section suggest that idiosyncratic tail risk is signiﬁcantly associated with the likelihood of  a forced CEO turnover and offers incremental information as compared to accounting and market measures of performance  and, more importantly, idiosyncratic volatility.   4. 2.  Is the idiosyncratic tail risk effect different from a poor idiosyncratic performance effect.   A possible explanation for our ﬁnding still remains that our measures of idiosyncratic ES (based on extreme negative  returns) are to some extent capturing an effect due to low idiosyncratic stock returns.  We conduct a series of tests to further  demonstrate that idiosyncratic tail risk has an effect on forced CEO turnover independently from realized idiosyncratic stock  performance.   Speciﬁcally, we start by focusing on a sub-sample of banks that excludes low idiosyncratic returns (based on the sample  median) and re-estimate the competing risks hazard model for this sub-sample.  As shown in column (1) of Table 5 , we still  ﬁnd that idiosyncratic tail risk is associated (at the 10% level) with a greater hazard of CEO dismissal, while systematic tail  risk does not matter for CEO dismissals.  Therefore, the impact of idiosyncratic tail risk on forced turnover is also observable  when we exclude poorly performing banks.   We next construct a sub-sample of banks that exclude those institutions with (simultaneously) low idiosyncratic performance (below the sample median) and high idiosyncratic volatility (above the sample median) to control for the  possibility that our above ﬁnding is motivated by a high volatility effect.  Again, we still ﬁnd that idiosyncratic tail risk  is signiﬁcant (at the 10% level) in our model.   As a further robustness check, we repeat our analysis by using alternative extreme risk measures that, as shown in the  Online Appendix , have a much lower correlation with measures of realized idiosyncratic stock performance (and volatility).  We start by following Bushman and Williams (2015) that employ Skewness as an alternative market-based measure  of extreme risk.  Next, we employ a risk measure focusing on extreme accounting returns ( Accounting Downside Risk ).  This  th percentile of the  measure is computed as a dummy variable that takes a value of one if a bank’s ROA is below the 5  estimated earnings distribution that we assume follows a normal distribution and we build on the basis of a seven year  rolling window of accounting returns starting from 20 0 0.  Consistent with our main analysis, we then compute the ﬁrmspeciﬁc (idiosyncratic) and non-ﬁrm-speciﬁc (systematic) risk measures.  We still ﬁnd that forced CEO turnover is limited to  the ﬁrm-speciﬁc component of tail risk.   4. 3.  Alternative model speciﬁcations  We conduct various additional tests to check the robustness of our key ﬁndings.  We report the results of these additional  tests in the Online Appendix .  We ﬁrst address the concern that our results may be sensitive to using a competing risks  hazard model.  We, therefore, estimate a multinomial logit model that is commonly employed by the prior literature on the  determinants of executive turnovers ( Huson et al. , 2001 ).  Second, we use a simple Cox hazard model whereby we focus only  on forced CEO turnovers and treat all voluntary turnovers as censored observations, as in Brookman and Thistle (2009) and  Jenter and Kannan (2015) .  The results of these tests conﬁrm that our primary ﬁndings still hold.   Next, we stipulate that a CEO should be in charge for at least two consecutive years before experiencing a turnover event.   Hence, we exclude all observations where CEO turnovers took place less than two years after a new CEO was appointed.   Again, we do not ﬁnd any change in our ﬁndings.   In our sample period numerous countries experienced a systemic crisis as identiﬁed by Laeven and Valencia (2013) .  It  is often argued that CEO dismissals during crises may be a response by boards to increasing public vitriol and regulatory  12 To control for the inﬂuence of systemic banking crises on  scrutiny into holding executives responsible for mismanagement.   our results, we include a dummy ( Crisis ) variable that takes the value of one for every year-country combination identifying  a systemic banking crisis.  Our primary ﬁndings remain similar as regards the positive relationship between idiosyncratic tail  risk and the likelihood of CEO dismissals.   4. 4.  Does the importance of idiosyncratic tail risk on forced turnovers depend on the banking market structure.   Our results are consistent with the view that a bank board learns about the CEO’s decision making via the exposure to  idiosyncratic tail risk.  A key implication deriving from such a result is that the importance assigned to idiosyncratic tail risk  should depend on the market structure within which the bank operates.   Speciﬁcally, previous studies on non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms argue that the importance assigned to signals related to CEO choices  becomes lower when the industry concentration is higher ( Brickley, 2003.  DeFond and Park, 1999.  Goyal and Park, 2002 ) as  the assessment of CEO decision making is better facilitated in competitive environments.  Furthermore, more concentrated  markets tend to be characterized by greater diﬃculties in replacing an incumbent CEO because of the lower number of  peers in the external market for executives ( Brickley, 2003.  Fee et al. , 2013.  Yonker, 2017 ).   While the existing empirical evidence focuses on the interplay between performance and market structure, a similar argument should hold for idiosyncratic tail risk.  In this section, we test this conjecture by extending our baseline speciﬁcation  with interaction terms between idiosyncratic and systematic ES and our measure of banking market concentration.   The results reported in column (1) of Table 6 show that the coeﬃcient of Idiosyncratic ES  Bank Concentration is negative  and statistically signiﬁcant.  This indicates that in more concentrated banking markets, large banks are less likely to dismiss  CEOs when idiosyncratic tail risk increases.  The results also appear economically relevant.  an increase in the degree of bank  concentration from the lowest quartile (i. e.  countries with low concentration) to the highest quartile (i. e.  countries with  high concentration) is associated with a reduction in the sensitivity of forced turnovers to idiosyncratic tail risk by 54% for  a one standard deviation increase in idiosyncratic tail risk for model (1).  Furthermore, as shown in column (2), we achieve a  similar result when we employ the (log of) market share in the deposit market of the four largest banks in a given country  as an alternative measure of banking market concentration.   Overall, in line with the prior evidence that indicates concentration reduces the sensitivity of forced CEO turnovers to  relative performance in non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms ( DeFond and Park, 1999.  Goyal and Park, 2002 ), we show that in the case of the  banking industry, market concentration is also associated with a reduced sensitivity of CEO dismissals to idiosyncratic tail 4. 5.  Which bank stakeholders care more about idiosyncratic tail risk.  In this section we evaluate which bank stakeholders are associated with an increased sensitivity of CEO turnovers to idiosyncratic tail risk.  We look at the role played by bank uninsured creditors, inside shareholders, regulators and institutional  investors.  To capture the inﬂuence of uninsured creditors, we focus on subordinated debtholders since they are subject to  a larger risk of suffering losses than other bank creditors and are a key source of discipline for bank executives ( Ashcraft,  2008.  Goyal, 2005.  Nier and Baumann, 2006 ).   Insiders might have a lower tolerance for idiosyncratic tail risk since they have limited diversiﬁcation opportunities ( Gao,  2010 ).  Consequently, a higher level of insider ownership might result in internalizing the costs of a bank default ( Booth  et al. , 2002 ) and lead to a decline in the expected utility of pursuing risky policies ( Faccio et al. , 2011 ).  In short, bank  insiders might fear the costs associated with idiosyncratic tail risk more than other types of bank shareholders.   Under the micro-prudential view of banking regulation, increased supervisory power should be associated with a larger  sensitivity of CEO turnover to idiosyncratic tail risk.  More controversial is the possible role of institutional investors.  While  they might have better skills in monitoring bank management than other shareholders, the fact that institutional investors  usually hold diversiﬁed portfolios might reduce the importance assigned to idiosyncratic tail risk when assessing CEO performance.   To conduct the empirical tests, we estimate models with interaction terms between the selected variables and tail risk  measures.  The results, reported in Table 7 , suggest that some types of bank stakeholders might be more important than  others in exercising discipline in terms of idiosyncratic tail risk.  Speciﬁcally, an increase in the share of subordinated debt  in a bank’s capital structure or in inside ownership is associated with an increased sensitivity of CEO turnover to idiosyncratic tail risk but this sensitivity does not vary with the strength of supervisory power or the importance of institutional  shareholders.   Overall, the results discussed in this section are not surprising when compared to US-based studies on non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms  ( Del Guercio et al. , 2008.  Guo and Masulis, 2015.  Kaplan and Minton, 2012.  Parrino et al. , 2003 ).  Nevertheless, we caution  drawing conclusions from the reported ﬁndings given the cross-country heterogeneity in bank governance structures in our  sample.   4. 6.  Do bank boards see systematic tail risk as fully unrelated to CEO choices.   We next evaluate when systematic tail risk is important for the ﬁring decision.  This additional analysis is motivated by  a growing body of banking research showing that systematic tail risks are not necessarily exogenous to bank behavior (see,  for instance, Acharya et al. , 2010 .  Farhi and Tirole, 2012 .  Pennacchi, 2006 ).   Our approach is to test for the presence of variation in the sensitivity of forced CEO turnover to systematic tail risk when  there are changes in the consequences a bank can suffer from being exposed to such risks.  A variation in the sensitivity of  forced turnover to systematic tail risks in the presence of these changes would suggest that an exposure to systematic tail  risk is related, at least in part, to CEO choices.   To conduct this additional analysis, we consider three different settings.  The ﬁrst two settings identify contexts where  shareholders might see being exposed to systematic tail risk as more costly.  We start by focusing on the period post 2010  when there was greater regulatory and policy attention to systemic matters related to large ﬁnancial institutions However, it  can be argued that the post 2010 environment also witnessed other broader economic changes that may result in a weaker  identiﬁcation.  In an attempt to provide a more reﬁned test, we next focus on the institutions in our sample included in the  list of global systemically important ﬁnancial institutions by the Financial Stability Board since 2010.  For these institutions  regulatory costs are closely related to systemic effects.  The inclusion in this list is seen negatively by shareholders (see  Bongini et al. , 2015 ) and banks can be removed only when they do not pose a global systemic threat.   Accordingly, our expectation is that if CEO choices are seen as inﬂuencing a bank’s exposure to systematic tail risk, we  should observe an increase in the sensitivity of CEO turnover to systematic tail risk post-2010 and, more importantly, for  banks that are identiﬁed as globally systemically important.  To conduct our analysis, we ﬁrst interact our measures of tail  risk with a dummy equal to one for the years after 2010.  Next, we repeat a similar test using a dummy (SIFI) equal to one  for global systemically important ﬁnancial institutions.   In a third test, we use the cross-country variation in the adoption of blanket guarantees by governments on banks debts.   Under a blanket guarantee, a government offers protection against a bank default to creditors that are not conventionally  protected by deposit insurance.  The purpose is to prevent negative externalities arising from correlated bank defaults ( Laeven  and Valencia, 2012 ).  Under a blanket guarantee, the mispricing of government guarantees is more pronounced and banks  have more possibilities to extract value from the ﬁnancial safety net via their risk-taking.  To extract value, however, banks  have to avoid closure by regulators and, thereby, beneﬁt from forbearance ( Allen and Saunders, 1993.  Ronn and Verma,  1986 ).  This is more likely when banks increase their exposure to non-ﬁrm-speciﬁc risks ( Acharya and Yorulmazer, 2007.   Brown and Dinç, 2011 ).  In the presence of a blanket guarantee, we should, therefore, observe a decrease in the sensitivity  of a forced CEO turnover to systematic tail risk if CEO choices can inﬂuence the exposure to this risk.  To conduct this third  test, we employ a dummy ( Blanket Guarantee ) that equals one for the time period over which bank liabilities in each coun13 We then include this dummy and its interaction with the tail risk measures as additional explanatory  try were insured.   variables in our models.   Columns (1) and (2) of Table 8 show the key findings of the first and the second tests, while column (3) reports the results of the third test.  In general, the results suggest that an exposure to systematic tail risk is, at least, partially related to CEO choices.  The interaction terms between our measures of systematic tail risk and the post 2010 or the SIFI dummy (the blanket guarantee dummy) are positive (negative) and statistically significant at customary levels.  In summary, the ﬁndings discussed in this section suggest that bank boards assign importance to systematic tail risk for  forced CEO turnovers when there is a major variation in the costs that the exposure to this risk generates for shareholders  and the bank.   <Conclusion> Conclusions.  Our analysis shows that the likelihood of a forced CEO turnover (but not of a voluntary turnover) is positively associated  with idiosyncratic tail risk.  Thus, large bank CEOs do seem to bear some costs of increasing the idiosyncratic tail risk of  their banks.  Furthermore, the relation with idiosyncratic tail risk is stronger in less concentrated banking industries and in  the presence of stakeholders that have more to lose from an increase in this risk.  In general, we document that idiosyncratic  tail risk offers information to assess CEOs’ decision making that is different from what can be inferred from accounting and  market measures of performance and idiosyncratic volatility.   Finally, we show that the lack of importance of systematic tail risk that we observe over the full sample period for CEO  dismissal does not imply this risk is fully independent from CEO choices.
