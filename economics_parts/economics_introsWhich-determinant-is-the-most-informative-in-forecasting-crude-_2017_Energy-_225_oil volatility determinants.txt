 1.  Introduction Explaining the main determinants and improving the forecast accuracy of crude oil market volatility are crucial to market investors and government decision makers.  However, forecasting oil volatility is an intractable task, as the crude oil market is quite complex and has various uncertain determinants, such as global oil supply and demand, OPEC spare capacity levels, ﬁnancial crises, and national elections.  Some studies have claimed that oil price change relies heavily on oil demand and supply, especially global demand (i. e. , Dées et al. , 2007.  Kilian, 2009.  Mu and Ye, 2011).  However, other studies have argued that a speculative component plays a key role (Zhang, 2013.  Hamilton and Wu, 2014.  Kilian and Murphy, 2014.  Juvenal and Petrella, 2015.  Gogolin and Kearney, 2016).  Liu et al.  (2016) disentangle the contributions of oil demand, supply, and speculation in real oil prices, whereas Yin and Zhou (2016) identify the role of speculation and economic fundamentals in driving oil price volatility.  However, as in the seminal work of Baker et al.  (2013) on measuring economic policy uncertainty (EPU), it is worth mentioning that many studies have examined the effect of EPU on the stock market and have considered EPU indices in forecasting stock market returns (Pastor and Veronesi, 2012.  Antonakakis et al. , 2013.  Kang and Ratti, 2013.  Tsai, 2017).  The literature about EPU's impact on the oil market is growing in recent years (e. g. , Aloui et al. , 2016.  Balcilar et al. , 2016.  Yin, 2016).  For example, Aloui et al.  (2016) hold that the movements in uncertainty index can identify the supply-side, aggregate-demand, and oil-speciﬁc demand shocks, that directly drive the oil price.  Thus, an increase (decrease) in the uncertainty index probably negatively (positively) affects the economy, which in turn reduces (increases) the demand and supply of crude oil and then cause oil price volatility.  Balcilar et al.  (2016) also emphasize that EPU can drive the oil price ﬂuctuations.  We conjecture that a high EPU can cause serious divergence in the expectations of oil consumers, producers, and speculators simultaneously and thus affect the demand, supply, or speculation stock for crude oil.  Therefore, EPU may comprehensively involves various information such as oil shocks, ﬁnancial crisis, and political events that greatly impact the oil market and cause oil price volatility.  However, it is not clear whether EPU is the most informative factor in forecasting oil volatility, and which determinant is the most powerful remains to be addressed.  This study is speciﬁcally related to the literature on the determinants of oil market return or volatility (e. g. , Dées et al. , 2007.  Kilian, 2009.  Mu and Ye, 2011.  Conrad et al. , 2014.  Hamilton and Wu, 2014.  Kilian and Murphy, 2014.  Gogolin and Kearney, 2016) and the predictability of EPU indices in asset return or volatility (e. g. , Pastor and Veronesi, 2012.  Antonakakis et al. , 2013.  Kang and Ratti, 2013.  Tsai, 2017).  We address two questions.  First, is EPU helpful for forecasting crude oil market volatility.  Second, which determinant is most informative and helpful in forecasting spot oil volatility—oil demand, supply, speculation, or the novel EPU index.  To answer these questions, we consider two newly released global EPU (GEPU) indices and six countryspeciﬁc EPU indices from major oil consumers and producers worldwide.  This allows us to investigate whether these new indices help in forecasting oil volatility and to compare their predictabilities with those of traditional determinants.  Regarding the models for forecasting asset volatility, GARCH and its extensions have been popularly used in empirical analyses (e. g. , Bollerslev, 1987.  Glosten et al. , 1993.  Cheong, 2009.  Mohammadi and Su, 2010.  Nomikos and Andriosopoulos, 2012.  Charles and Darné, 2014.  Eﬁmova and Serletis, 2014).  However, most of these models are strictly limited to imputing data at the same frequency.  Ghysels et al.  (2004) introduce mixed data sampling (MIDAS) regression models, which successfully address the data frequency problem.  To overcome the defect of GARCH-class models, Engle et al.  (2013) incorporate the MIDAS technique with the GARCH model, forming the GARCH-MIDAS model, which allows macroeconomic determinants to be incorporated at different sampling frequencies.  Conrad et al.  (2014) use the GARCH-MIDAS model to investigate the oil volatility with respect to the stance of the U. S.  macroeconomy but they focus on insample evidence.  Combination methods have also been argued to achieve stable forecast ability (Stock and Watson, 2004).  They can be categorized as constant combined models and time-varying combination methods.  Speciﬁcally, Raftery et al.  (2012) develop the dynamic model averaging (DMA) technique, which Liu et al.  (2017) successfully apply as a time-varying combination method to forecast volatilities of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil futures, accounting for both parameter and model uncertainty.  We construct 11 individual GARCHMIDAS models and three DMA model combinations with various determinants.  Although both Conrad et al.  (2014) and our study involve the determinants of oil price volatility.  However, our innovation is quite different from theirs in several ways.  First, based on the controversy in crude oil market, we aim to address the question which determinant is most informative and helpful in forecasting spot oil volatility, i. e. , oil demand, supply, speculation, or the novel EPU indices.  Whereas, the main contribution of Conrad et al.  (2014) provide the ﬁrst evidence on the link between U. S.  economic activity and the daily oil-stock correlation.  They examine whether the long-term oil and stock market volatility, as well as oil-stock correlation respond to the same macroeconomic information, especially, the oil-stock correlation.  Second, due to the different aims, Conrad et al.  (2014) consider the determinants that contain information on current and future U. S.  economic activity.  Unlike those determinants, we are the ﬁrst to integrate both the global economic policy uncertainty (GEPU) indices and several national economic policy uncertainty (EPU) indices with traditional determinants, such as global oil demand, supply, and speculation.  Third, unlike Conrad et al.  (2014), this study mainly concerns the models' out-of-sample performance.  We make two contributions.  First, we are the ﬁrst to consider various EPU indices, especially the GEPU indices and the country-speciﬁc EPU indices from major oil consumers and exporters, and the traditional determinants in forecasting crude oil market volatility.  Aloui et al.  (2016) suggest that EPU indices can identify three types of shock on oil prices (i. e. , supply-side, aggregate, and oil-speciﬁc demand).  Furthermore, we argue that EPU not only inﬂuences oil demand-supply fundamentals, but also changes market participants' sentiments, giving rise to speculation activities, and thus may contain more information and achieve better oil volatility forecasting accuracy than commonly used determinants.  Our empirical study provides an overview of the EPU indices and traditional determinants in forecasting oil volatility.  Second, we model daily oil volatility using a GARCH-MIDAS model with different monthly determinants.  To provide the time-varying effects of the determinants, we also apply DMA combination methods, allowing both a set of determinants and their coefﬁcients to change over time.  Furthermore, the models' forecasting performance is evaluated using the robust advanced model conﬁdence set (MCS) test (Hansen et al. , 2011).  We use monthly global oil demand, supply record, and speculation data and two GEPU indices and six country-speciﬁc EPU indices to model and forecast the daily volatility of WTI crude oil spot prices.  The main empirical results indicate that EPU indices contain more useful information than oil demand-supply fundamentals or speculation indices in determining the daily volatility of crude oil prices.  In particular, the GEPU index and the U. S. ’s EPU index produce more accurate volatility forecasts of WTI oil prices than other determinants.  Finally, no evidence is found that DMA combination methods are superior to individualThe rest of this paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 presents a brief literature review, which serves as a foundation for analyzing the determinants of oil volatility.  Section 3 describes the GARCH-MIDAS model and the DMA combination approach.  Section 4 discusses the data.  Section 5 presents the empirical results.  Section 6 concludes the2.  Literature review.  In this section, we revisit the literature on the subject.  Numerous studies have examined the determinants of oil price or returns.  The predominant explanation for oil price change is that oil price relies on oil demand and supply (Kilian, 2009.  Mu and Ye, 2011).  For example, Kilian (2009) distinguishes oil demand and supply shocks in oil price changes and claims that increases in oil price are mainly driven by demand.  Moreover, with the ﬁnancialization of crude oil, many papers have recognized the role of speculation and have examined its effect on oil prices (Kilian and Murphy, 2014.  Juvenal and Petrella, 2015.  Gogolin and Kearney, 2016).  Liu et al.  (2016) disentangle the oil demand, supply, and speculation of real oil prices.  Their results show that oil demand from the U. S.  and China plays a key role in oil price changes after 2000, whereas speculation contributes much less to oil price ﬂuctuations.  In particular, since Baker et al.  (2013) constructed the EPU index to measure EPU, many empirical studies have highlighted the importance of EPU indices in forecasting asset return and volatility (Pastor and Veronesi, 2012.  Antonakakis et al. , 2013, 2014.  Kang and Ratti, 2013.  Balcilar et al. , 2016.  Tsai, 2017).  There are growing literature on EPU's impact on the oil market, Antonakakis et al.  (2014) examine the relationship between EPU and oil prices and claim that EPU indices affect oil prices.  Bekiros et al.  (2015) claim that EPU matters in predicting oil price changes.  Recently, Aloui et al.  (2016) investigate the effect of uncertainty on crude oil returns.  Their results show that higher EPU indices signiﬁcantly increase crude oil returns only during certain periods.  Yin (2016) also illustrates the importance of policy uncertainty for both oil spot and futures returns.  Speciﬁcally, Aloui et al.  (2016) provide an accurate picture of the conditional dependence between oil and uncertainty.  They claim that increased uncertainty leads to increased oil prices, as oil suppliers can stock up due to a precautionary motive.  Thus, oil price ﬂuctuations can reﬂect either demand or supply shocks.  In addition, Balcilar et al.  (2016) emphasize the role of EPU as a driver of oil price ﬂuctuations.  These ﬁndings illustrate that EPU indices can be good determinants in forecasting the oil volatility.  GEPU indices are constructed and released monthly.  The GEPU index is a GDP-weighted average of national EPU indices, accounting for two thirds of the global GDP.  Currently, there are two versions of the GEPU index—that with nominal GDP weights and that with purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted GDP weights.  Few studies have applied the newly released GEPU index.  Speciﬁcally, oil is the main energy source of the modern world, and oil price uncertainty is crucial for all countries.  Furthermore, oil price ﬂuctuations are affected by the EPUs of many countries, especially the countries of main oil consumers and producers.  In this regard, the GEPU index is supposed to be a good determinant of oil price volatility.  EPU indices reﬂect not only demand-supply fundamentals and economic activity, but also investors' sentiments.  Thus, EPU indices, especially the GEPU index, are supposed to be synthetic determinants of oil price uncertainty.  Colombo (2013) ﬁnds that the EPU of the U. S.  drives the EPUs of major European countries, Canada, and China, implying that a shock to the U. S.  EPU affects worldwide uncertainty.  Thus, the U. S.  EPU may have a greater effect on the global oil market.  We include two global indices and six national EPU indices from major oil exporters and consumers worldwide.  This allows us to examine whether these new indices help forecast oil volatility and to compare the predictabilities of these determinants.  There are various theoretical approaches to modeling and forecasting oil market volatility.  Of the models based on low-frequency data, the majority of empirical investigations of oil volatility that use daily or monthly data have used GARCH-class models (Cheong, 2009.  Mohammadi and Su, 2010.  Nomikos and Andriosopoulos, 2012.  Charles and Darné, 2014.  Eﬁmova and Serletis, 2014).  Although GARCH-class models and their extensions are widely used, most are limited to data at the same frequency.  Interestingly, Ghysels et al.  (2004) introduce MIDAS regression models.  MIDAS regression successfully addresses the problem of the explained and explanatory variables being sampled at different frequencies, such as daily, weekly, and monthly.  Ghysels et al.  (2006) construct MIDAS-AR and consider various MIDAS regressions to predict equity volatility.  In the MIDAS framework, Ghysels et al.  (2007) propose some extensions, such as nonlinear MIDAS and multi-variable MIDAS.  Engle et al.  (2013) construct the GARCH-MIDAS model by incorporating MIDAS with the commonly used GARCH model.  The GARCH-MIDAS model has several advantages.  For instance, it distinguishes long- and short-term volatility.  It also differentiates low-frequency volatility and macro fundamentals as longterm volatility, and provides a ﬂexible methodology.  Thus, it has been applied in many recent forecasting practices (e. g. , Engle et al. , 2013.  Asgharian et al. , 2013.  Conrad et al. , 2014).  For example, Engle et al.  (2013) use the GARCH-MIDAS model to measure the contribution of macroeconomic variables to forecasting stock market volatility.  Asgharian et al.  (2013) apply the GARCH-MIDAS model to examine whether macroeconomic variables can help forecast stock return variance.  These empirical studies support that the GARCH-MIDAS model signiﬁcantly improves forecasting accuracy and outperforms the traditional GARCH model.  Especially, using the GARCH-MIDAS framework, Conrad et al.  (2014) analyze whether the long-term oil volatility is related to the U. S.  macroeconomy determinants such as industrial production (IP), national activity index (NAI), and so on.  In light of this, we consider different monthly determinants and incorporate them into GARCH-MIDAS to model and forecast daily spot oil volatility.  Although many individual models, such as GARCH and GARCHMIDAS, have been applied in the economics and ﬁnance ﬁelds, Stock and Watson (2004) point out that the predictabilities of individual models are very unstable and change over time.  Hence, some studies have discussed how to combine a set of forecasts to produce superior composite forecasts (Liu and Maheu, 2008.  Santos and Ziegelmann,In particular, Raftery et al.  (2010) propose the DMA method, which allows the model to vary with variables over time.  The important feature of the DMA method is that it allows for both time-varying coefﬁcients and a large state space model (i. e. , the set of oil volatility determinants can change over time).  Consequently, DMA has been widely used in forecasting in recent years (e.
