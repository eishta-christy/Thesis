In a number of developing countries, biogas has been promoted as a
renewable, cleaner and cheaper energy source, especially for cooking, as
compared to alternatives such as ﬁrewood and kerosene.  For instance,
countries such as China and India have a long history of promoting biogas.  However, it is only in the last twenty ﬁve years that household
level biogas programmes, which promote construction of digesters or
tanks which convert organic waste into biogas, have spread across the
globe. 1 According to Rakotojaona (2013), N250,000 digesters have
been installed in Nepal since 1992 and about 125,000 in Vietnam in
2003.  Other Asian countries with household biogas programmes include
Cambodia and Bangladesh which launched their biogas programmes in
2006 and most recently, Pakistan and Indonesia in 2009. 2
In the Indonesian context, while a majority of the population has
access to electricity for lighting, biomass, mainly wood, remains an
important energy source for cooking (see Table 1).  At the national
level, in 2011, for 40% of Indonesian households, ﬁrewood was
their primary cooking fuel, while in East Java, 43% of households
relied mainly on ﬁrewood for cooking and about 52% used liqueﬁed
petroleum gas (LPG).  The substantial use of LPG is relatively new
and is a consequence of the country's large-scale kerosene to LPG
conversion programme (2007–2012) which was motivated by a
desire to reduce the budgetary burden of the kerosene subsidy. 3
Despite the conversion programme and other reforms which have
reduced the subsidy burden, the growth in energy demand
combined with declining domestic production and an increase in
fuel imports continues to ensure that subsidies for oil-based fuels
remain a large burden on the budget (see Asian Development
Bank, 2015; International Institute for Sustainable Development,At the same time as attempting to reduce the subsidy burden
through the conversion programme the government passed a
number of decrees and acts which recognized the importance of
promoting and developing alternative energy sources and technologies, both from an environmental and a budgetary perspective
(see SNV, 2009).  Speciﬁcally, a presidential decree (No. 5/2006) on
National Energy Policy released in January 2006 stated the
government's goal of ensuring security of energy supply by reducing the share of oil-based fuels in the country's energy mix from
51% in 2006 to 20% in 2025, primarily by increasing the share of renewable energy. 
Speciﬁcally with regard to biogas, mainly due to the widespread
availability of ﬁrewood and heavy subsidies for kerosene, its use in
Indonesia has been limited.  However, since 2005, following the
reduction of kerosene subsidies and consistent with the National
Energy Policy of reducing reliance on oil-based fuels, various institutions and organizations began developing activities to disseminate
manure fed biogas digesters.  By the end of 2009, through ﬁfteen
initiatives about 6000 digesters had been installed for domestic
use (SNV, 2009).  To consolidate these scattered efforts and to
boost the spread of biogas, in 2009, the Indonesian government
launched a Household Biogas Program (Programme Biogas Rumah –
BIRU).  The key objective of the programme was to install 8000 digesters by 2012 in rural dairy farming households located in eight
provinces.  The focus of the program was on East Java.  The program
operates through dairy cooperatives and is voluntary.  Dairy farmers
who fulﬁl eligibility conditions such as ownership of at least two
cows and who have an established record of delivering milk to a
cooperative are offered a chance to purchase a digester.  An innovative aspect of the BIRU program is its co-operation with international companies, which makes it easier for dairy farmers to accessSimilar to biogas programs in other countries, the expectation is that
the use of biogas will generate immediate beneﬁts by reducing the use
of traditional fuels and energy-related expenditures, as well as lead to
time-savings due to a reduction in time spent gathering wood. 
Longer-term beneﬁts include enhanced agricultural productivity due
to the use of bio-slurry, a by-product of biogas production which may
be used as a fertiliser,
improvements in indoor air quality and
subsequent health beneﬁts.  Despite these expectations and the large
number of initiatives in a number of Asian and African countries (see
Rakotojaona, 2013; Hessen, 2014), credible evidence on the actual
impacts of such household biogas programs on short-term outcomes
such as use of traditional fuels and energy-related expenditures as
well on longer-term outcomes such as agricultural productivity and
health outcomes is limited.  The bulk of the evidence is based on either
before-after comparisons or single-period comparisons between
households with and without a digester. 
For instance, based on a before-after comparison of a sample of
461 biogas users in Nepal, Katuwal and Bohara (2009) report a
53% reduction in the use of ﬁrewood and an 81% reduction in
the time spent collecting ﬁrewood.  Employing a similar approach
but working with a sample of only 12 users, Garfí Name (2012) report a 50 to 60% reduction in the use of ﬁrewood.  Despite these
effects, the lack of a control group hampers the credibility of the
analysis. 
Alternatively, based on single-period comparisons between 615
biogas users and 740 non-users drawn from 133 villages, a study of
India's National Biogas Development Project (Program Evaluation
Organisation, 2002) found that a majority of digesters (55%) were not
operational.  Nevertheless, user households reduced their monthly
consumption of ﬁrewood by 10 kg.  Based on data from three villages
in Western China in 2006 (239 households; 183 users and 56 nonusers), Groenendaal and Gehua (2010) concluded that despite working
with a sample of relatively long-term digester users the many beneﬁts
attributed to the use of digesters had only partly been realized, if at
all.  For most of the outcomes there were no statistically signiﬁcant
differences between users and non-users.  In both these studies the
approach used to determine the control group was not clear and
assessments were based on differences in means, without controlling
for variables which might inﬂuence both uptake of digesters and
outcomes. 5
A perhaps more rigorous assessment of the effect of a biogas initiative, Rwanda's National Domestic Biogas Program (NDBP), is provided
by Bedi Name (2015).  While their study also uses cross-section data
and compares outcomes for users and non-users, the non-users were
selected from a list of “potential applicants” that is, those who had
shown an interest in purchasing a digester and at the same time the
non-users needed to fulﬁl the most important eligibility condition to
become a user, that is, own at least two cows.  Their multivariate
analysis showed that owning a digester was associated with a 31 to
32% reduction in annual energy expenditure and a ﬁve kilogram or
34% reduction in daily consumption of ﬁrewood.  At the same time
they reported that about 10% of the supposedly completed digesters
were producing no gas, and that the cost of installing a digester was prohibitive leading to a large gap between the number of digesters that
were expected to be set up (15,000) and the number that were actually
installed (1800). 
The aim of this paper, which focuses on dairy farmers in East Java, is
to examine the impact of Indonesia's Household Biogas Program (BIRU)
on two main outcomes, that is, fuel use - whether access to digesters
leads to reductions in the use of an oil-based fuel - liqueﬁed petroleum
gas and the use of a traditional fuel - wood, and whether it leads to a
decline in energy-related expenditure.  In order to assess the viability
of the intervention we provide an exploratory payback analysis. 
Methodologically, the paper extends the literature by using multiple
evaluation strategies and providing estimates based on both crosssection and panel data.  In doing so, we attempt to place the literature
on the effects of household biogas initiatives on a stronger empirical
footing. 
The paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 contains a description of
the program.  Section 3 outlines the empirical approach, Section 4 lays
out the sampling strategy and discusses the data and descriptive
statistics.  Section 5 discusses the ﬁndings and presents a payback analysis while Section 6 concludes. 
2.  Indonesia's household biogas program – Key features. 
In 2008, the Government of Indonesia in co-operation with the
Government of the Netherlands commissioned a feasibility study.  The
study highlighted that the climatic conditions, especially high
temperatures throughout the year and availability of water, provided
a favourable environment for the production of biogas.  The report
pegged the number of potential digesters users at more than one million
dairy farming households in Java and Bali, where zero grazing is widely
practised (SNV, 2009). 6
In 2009, as a consequence of the feasibility study, Indonesia
launched a Household Biogas Program (BIRU). 7 BIRU's overall objective
is to disseminate domestic digesters in order to create a local, sustainable energy alternative.  The program set itself a target of installing
8000 family sized (plant sizes of 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 m3) digesters in
eight Indonesian provinces (East Java, DIY Yogyakarta, Central Java,
West Java, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara, South Sulawesi and Lampung)
by the end of 2012.  Although the programme had a slow start, it soon
picked up momentum.  By May 2011 the target for 2011 had already
been achieved, with over 2700 installed digesters and over 900
applicants awaiting construction of a digester.  By the end of 2012, it
had met its target of disseminating about 8000 biogas digesters (see
Table A. 1).  The BIRU program focuses mainly on East Java (62% of all
digesters), followed by Lombok/Bali (17%), West Java (10%) and Central
Java (9. 6%) (see Table A. 2). 
BIRU carries out its work through intermediaries or so-called,
Construction Partner Organizations (CPOs) and biogas supervisors. 
Typically, the CPOs are co-operative organizations or local NGOs.  In
Java, dairy co-operatives are key partners in the BIRU programme and
help disseminate the biogas concept among dairy farmers.  The CPOs
raise awareness about biogas among their members in their regular
meetings or in special gatherings explicitly for the purpose of discussing
this issue.  If members show interest, the CPO carries out a farm eligibility assessment, which is based on criteria such as having at least two
cows, a positive cash ﬂow from milk revenues supplied to the cooperative, and a farmer's debt history.  In addition, the CPO veriﬁes
whether the farm plot is large enough to install a digester.  If a farmer
qualiﬁes, ﬁnancial arrangements are negotiated with the help of the
CPO, and subsequently masons trained by BIRU are deployed to
construct the digesters. 8 After the digester has been installed, the
mason ﬁles a completion report, and BIRU carries out quality control
checks.  BIRU trains dairy farmers on the proper usage of digesters. 
They receive a user manual and a mason is present during initial plant
feeding.  BIRU guarantees an after sale service of two years. 9
Depending on the size, the cost of a digester lies between €450 and
€700.  Regardless of the digester size, BIRU provides a ﬂat subsidy of
€160 (Table 2).  The remainder is paid by the farmer, usually through a
loan obtained from credit schemes offered by the cooperative.  The
repayment instalments are ﬁnanced by deductions from payments the
farmer receives for the delivery of milk.  Interest rates differ across
cooperatives, depending on the source of the loan.  A range of partners
have made resources available for the credit schemes, and while there
are no interest charges on 2 to 3 year loans provided by Nestlé, an
international food company, other partners such as Rabobank or Bank
Syariah Mandiri (BSM) charge interest rates of 8 to 11% with repayment
periods of 3 to 5 years.
