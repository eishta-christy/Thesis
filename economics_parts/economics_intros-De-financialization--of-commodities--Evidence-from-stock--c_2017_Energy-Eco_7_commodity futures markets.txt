 1.  Introduction After the equity market collapsed in 2000, many institutions considered commodities a new asset class after the widely publicized discovery of a negative correlation between commodity returns and stock returns by Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2006) and Erb and Harvey (2006).  As a result, billions of investment dollars ﬂowed into commodity markets from ﬁnancial institutions, insurance companies, pension funds, foundations, hedge funds, and wealthy individuals (Wang et al. , 2015.  Mi et al. , 2017).  A sharp increase in the popularity of commodity investing in the past decade has triggered an unprecedented inﬂow of institutional funds into commodity futures markets, referred to as the ﬁnancialization of commodities (Basak and Pavlova, 2016).  In recent years, many experts have noticed the inﬂuence of ﬁnancialization on commodity markets or the correlation between commodity markets and ﬁnancial markets.
