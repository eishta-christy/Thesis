 1.  Introduction Accelerated economic growth over the past decades due to a globalized ﬂow of people and goods has substantially increased airlines' energy costs and CO2 emissions.  According to statistical data of the International Air Transport Association (IATA, 2015), in 2012, the total energy cost for airlines was N160 billion dollars, measured on a worldwide base.  Besides, the CO2 emission volume was N0. 676 billion tons at that time.  In fact, the aviation industry is one of the few sectors where energy consumption has increased at a rate of N6% over the past 10 years.  This research focuses on the technical efﬁciency of Chinese airlines by using a novel SNDEA model for network and ﬂight efﬁciency, built upon multivariate copulas and capable of handling undesirable outputs such as CO2 emissions and ﬂight delays.  It is important to mention now to readers the distinctive nature of the word “network” that appears in this research.  It appears both as the descriptor of the modeling approach adopted – Network DEA, for a productive process that encompasses several sequential stages – and as the name of one of the productive stages modeled within the ambit of the airlines' operation – network efﬁciency, for an airline that efﬁciently converts physical and human resources into landings and take-offs with minimal delays.  Previous research on airlines have adopted to use several methods such as (i) factor productivity approach (Bauer, 1990.  Oum and Yu, 1995.  Barbot et al. , 2008).  (ii) Stochastic Frontier Analysis or SFA models (Good et al. , 1993.  Baltagi et al. , 1995.  Tsionas et al. , 2017).  (iii) Turnquist total factor productivity index (Coelli et al. , 2003.  Barbot et al. , 2008).  (iv) Data Envelopment Analysis or DEA models (Merkert and Hensher, 2011.  Barros et al. , 2013.  Barros and Peypoch, 2009.  Barros and Couto, 2013.  Cao et al. , 2015.  Li et al. , 2015.  Wanke and Barros, 2016.  Cui and Li, 2017a, 2017b.  Zhang et al. , 2017).  and (v) multi-criteria decisionmaking models such as TOPSIS (Barros and Wanke, 2015.  Wanke et al. , 2015).  On the other hand, it is worth noting that, within the airline efﬁciency ambit, DEA-based studies are the most numerous when compared to the SFA-based methods and other minor approaches used (Wanke et al. , 2015.  Barros and Wanke, 2015.  Wanke and Barros, 2016.  Li and Cui, 2017.  Cui and Li, 2017a, 2017b).  This not only replicates a pattern that is found in papers focused on efﬁciency analysis in other industries such as ports and banking (e. g.  Wanke et al. , 2016a, 2016b), but may be also derived by the ﬂexibility provided by DEA models in modeling productive processes composed of two or more stages.  In fact, several different issues have been addressed by DEA-based airline research studies in different countries or regions.  Besides efﬁciency rankings and slack comparisons, it is possible to point out, for instance, that the impacts of network size, ownership, and regulatory measures on the performance of the airline industry have been addressed by regressing efﬁciency scores onto contextual or environmental variables (Barros et al.
