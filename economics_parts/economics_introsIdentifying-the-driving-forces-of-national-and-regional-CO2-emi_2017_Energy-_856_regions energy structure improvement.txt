In recent years, climate change has aroused worldwide attention,
and in-depth international discussions have been held to mitigate
climate change.  Since 2007, China has surpassed the US to become the
world's largest CO2 emitter, and thus becomes a focus of global efforts
to reduce CO2 emissions.  As one of the Parties to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, China has always been
promoting the implementation of the Convention and fulﬁlling its obligations.  Chinese government committed to reduce CO2 emissions per
unit of gross domestic production (GDP) by 40–45% towards 2020 at
2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Conference and by 60–65% towards
2030 at 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference.  To achieve such
challenging emission-reduction targets, China has attempted to adopt
effective policy instruments, such as the deployment of renewable
energy, the establishment of national carbon emission trading market. 
China has experienced a signiﬁcant increase in CO2 emissions in the
past decades (Liu Name, 2015).  Large variations in the growth pattern of
China's CO2 emissions at the regional level exist due to uneven distribution of initial resource endowment, economic scale, industry structure,
development stage etc.  (Meng Name, 2016).  CO2 emissions per capita
and CO2 emissions per unit of GDP among China's 30 regions also vary
sharply (Shan Name, 2016).  Emission-reduction targets for each region
should be set in considering the characteristics of socio-economic
development (Wang Name, 2016).  Therefore, it is necessary to explore
the driving forces of the variations of national and regional CO2 emissions of China in order to set accurate emission-reduction targets and
take effective measures from the perspective of national and regionalThis study explores the changes of national and regional CO2
emissions using temporal decomposition analysis model, and analyzes
the differences of CO2 emissions between China's 30 regions and the national average using spatial decomposition analysis model.  In addition,
this study evaluates the potential of emission-reduction of China's 30
regions.  The study did not only contribute to the energy saving and
emission reduction of China's CO2 emissions but also provide some
targeted suggestion for emission-reduction at regional and sectoralThe remainder of this study is organized as follows.  Section 2 reviews some existing literature.  Section 3 presents the models including
temporal and spatial decomposition analysis models and data sources
used in this study, and the overview of the national and regional CO2
emissions in China.  Section 4 depicts the decomposition results and
evaluates the potential of emission-reduction in China's 30 regions. 
Section 5 details further discussion of the deep-rooted reasons of key
factors with larger effect on CO2 emissions and the future tendency of
contribution of key factors.  Section 6 shows conclusion of the analysis,
with summary and policy implications. 
2.  Literature review. 
Existing studies have been conducted to analyze the driving forces of
the variations of national and regional CO2 emissions from the perspective of temporal and spatial level. 
First, tracking changes of CO2 emissions and quantifying the driving forces of the changes over time have long been a focus area of
researchers and policymakers.  Intensive studies have analyzed the
CO2 emissions and the driving forces of the change of CO2 emissions
at national (Wu Name, 2005.  Jung Name, 2012.  Cortés-Borda Name,
2015.  Sumabat Name, 2016.  van Ruijven Name, 2016), regional (Liang
Name, 2007.  Geng Name, 2013.  Wang Name, 2017) and industrial
level (Lin and Moubarak, 2013.  Xu and Lin, 2016a.  Talbi, 2017) overSecond, growing interest among researchers in comparing regions in
terms of CO2 emissions emerges in recent years.  The comparison allows
variations among countries or regions to be revealed, the contributing
factors identiﬁed, and the scope for improvement better understood
(Ang Name, 2016).  Many studies on analyzing the differences in CO2
emissions among different countries (Sun, 2000a, 2000b.  Zhang and
Ang, 2001.  Bataille Name, 2007), regions (Feng Name, 2009.  Su and Ang,
2016.  Xu and Lin, 2016b.  Wang Name, 2016.  Xu Name, 2016), and a speciﬁc sector among regions (Cui and Li, 2015.  Xu and Lin, 2016a, 2016c. 
Long Name, 2016) have also been conducted.  Besides, some studies are
also involved in the spatio-temporal analysis on the differences in regional CO2 emissions in recent years (Huang and Meng, 2013.  Kim
and Dall'erba, 2014.  Chen and Yang, 2015.  Ang Name, 2016).  Existing
literatures on the spatial analysis mainly focus on the differences in
CO2 emissions among regions from the perspective of production or a
speciﬁc production sector, and less literature are involved in householdDecomposition analysis is usually used to analyze the variations in
energy usage and emissions (Ang, 2015).  The model can not only
identify the main driving forces of the variations in an aggregation but
also show the clearly quantitative results of to what extent the driving
forces affect the variations (Su and Ang, 2012, 2015).  The logistics
mean Division index (LMDI) model is a preferred index decomposition
analysis approach because of the advantages of path independence,
residue free, ability to handle zero values, and consistency in aggregation (Ang, 2004).  Previous studies mainly adopted LMDI model to
study the determinants of variations of an aggregate based on the data
collected chronologically at different points in time for a speciﬁc region,
such as Ang and Liu (2001), Wang Name (2005), Mairet and Decellas
(2009), Wang and Li (2016), Shao Name (2016), Lin and Ahmad
(2017).  Therefore, this study uses LMDI method to conduct a temporal
decomposition analysis of the changes of national and regional CO2
emissions of China. 
Ang Name (2015) proposed a multi-regional (M-R) spatial decomposition model, which can be used to analyze why the differences in CO2
emissions exist among countries or among different regions within a
country.  The model shows an advantage in reducing decomposition
cases, avoiding subjectivity in benchmark region selection, maintaining
the property of circularity, and providing valuable information in terms
of the potential of energy-saving and emission-reduction.  Therefore,
this study adopts the M-R spatial decomposition model to compare
the CO2 emission performance of China's 30 regions. 
This study explores the driving forces of the changes of national and
regional CO2 emissions using LMDI model, and investigates the driving
forces of the differences of CO2 emissions between China's 30 regions
and the national average using multi-regional M-R spatial decomposition analysis model.  Compared with the existing studies, the main contributions of this study are as follows.  (1) We carry out an in-depth
analysis to uncover the main driving forces of the changes of national
and regional CO2 emissions in China, and to analyze the dominant
driving forces of the differences in CO2 emissions among China's 30
regions.  The study provides deep insights into why and what degree
the key factors affect national and regional CO2 emissions of China
from the perspective of temporal and spatial dimensions, and offers
policymakers references to formulate and implement targeted mitigation policies at both national and regional level.  (2) The original M-R
spatial decomposition analysis model is improved in this study.  On
one hand, household sector is introduced into the M-R spatial decomposition model for the ﬁrst time, and thus this study quantiﬁes the effects
of urbanization, income improvement and population.  On the other
hand, economic output and economic structure are introduced into
the model in aspect of production sector.  The improved temporal and
spatial decomposition analysis models in this study can be employed
to analyze the variation of an aggregation, such as energy, water,
waste, pollutants etc. , from the perspective of both production sector
and household sector. 
<Middle> Modelology and data. 
3. 1.  Decomposition model. 
3. 1. 1.  Kaya identity. 
In the decomposition analysis framework, energy-related CO2
emissions are classiﬁed into two categories according to emission
sources.  energy-related CO2 emissions from production sector and
energy-related CO2 emissions from household sector.  National and
regional CO2 emissions in China can be decomposed into nine kinds of
driving forces, as shown in Eq.  (1). 
Where, i denotes each region in China.  j denotes the sectors involved in
this study (j=1,2,⋯,6 for agriculture, industry, construction, service,
urban residents and rural residents).  k denotes the energy type
consumed by each sector (k= 1, 2,⋯,12 for raw coal, coke, crude oil,
gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, LPG, reﬁnery gas, other petroleum
products, natural gas and electricity). 
The variables involved in the temporal and spatial decomposition
models are deﬁned in Tables 1 and 2. 
3. 1. 2.  Temporal decomposition analysis. 
Based on additive LMDI model proposed by Ang (2005), the
aggregate changes of CO2 emissions for each region of China between
the base year 0 and the target year T are decomposed into 9 driving
forces, see Eq.  (2), i. e. , carbon intensity effect, energy intensity effect
in the production sector, energy intensity effect in the household sector,
energy structure effect, industrial structure effect, urbanization effect,
economic scale effect, population scale effect and household income
improvement effect. 
The effects of various driving forces of regional CO2 emissions
between the base year 0 and the target year T for region i are calculated
using the following equations. 
3. 1. 3.  Spatial decomposition analysis. 
Spatial decomposition analysis is a popular useful in comparing
differences in energy consumption, energy efﬁciency or CO2 emissions
among regions within a country in a particular year (Su and Ang,
2016).  This study adopts the M-R spatial decomposition analysis
model to analyze the differences of CO2 emissions among different
regions in China.  In this spatial decomposition framework, each
targeted region is chosen to compare with a reference entity given by
the arithmetic average of the entire group.  In this study, China's 30
regions are ranked according to the descending order of the CO2
emissions, and the national average is chosen as the benchmark
reference for comparison for each pair.  The differences of CO2 emissions
between the regions i and the national average (∗), denoted as ΔCtot
(Ri−R∗), can be decomposed to give. 
Notably, carbon emission factors are constant for different fossil
energy, and carbon intensity effect including ΔCi, CIare always zero in the decomposition analysis.  Therefore, this study
considers the effects of other eight kinds of driving forces of national
and regional CO2 emissions in the following analysis. 
3. 2.  Data source, processing and variables. 
The study period is from 2000 to 2015, and is divided into 4 subperiods, i. e. , 2000–2005, 2006–2008, 2009–2012 and 2013–20,015 in
the temporal decomposition analysis.  The spatial scale includes China's
30 regions, which consists of 30 provinces and municipalities in mainland3. 2. 1.  Energy consumption (E) and CO2 emissions (C). 
The data for energy consumption and CO2 emissions of each region
in mainland China are derived from China Emission Accounts and
Datasets (CEADs). 2 National energy consumption and CO2 emissions
are the aggregation of China's 30 regional to ensure data consistency. 
The data for national and regional energy consumption are from
Energy Inventories for China and its 30 regions and cities in CEADs
(Seen Table A. 1).  The amount of energy consumption is measured by
million tons of standard coal equivalent (Mtce).  Twelve types of energy
resource are included in this study, i. e. , raw coal, coke, crude oil,
gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, LPG, reﬁnery gas, other petroleum
products, natural gas and electricity. 3
CEADs also publishes the latest CO2 emission inventories for China
and its 30 regions and cities, and two approaches are used to calculate
the CO2 emissions.  apparent emission accounting approach and the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sectoral approach. 
In this study, the data for CO2 emissions of each region are from
emission inventories by IPCC sectoral approach.  CO2 emissions for fossil
fuel consumption and for industrial processes by IPCC sectoral approach
are calculated based on Energy consumption data and Emission factors,
seen Eqs.  (22) and (23). 
Where, CEij represents the CO2 emissions of different sectors and energy
' represents the adjusted energy consumption.  NCVj repretypes.  ADij
sents the net caloriﬁc value of different energy types.  EFj refers to the
emission factors.  and Oij refers to the oxygenation efﬁciency of different
sectors and energy types. 
CEt represents the carbon emissions of industrial products, ADt
represents output of each industrial product and EFt represents the
emission factors for each industrial product. 
In addition, this study considers CO2 emissions from both fossil fuel
consumption and industrial processes when conducting overview
analysis of the national and regional CO2 emissions of China in
Section 2, and focuses on CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption
in the temporal and spatial decomposition analysis in Section 4. 
Energy-related CO2 emissions at national and regional level are
shown in Table A. 2. 
3. 2. 2.  Variables in socio-economic development. 
GDP, value-added of various sectors, disposable income and population in each region used in this study are obtained from China
Statistical Yearbook (NBSC, 2000-2015).  The multiple sectors are classiﬁed into two categories.  production sector (i. e. , agriculture, industry,
construction, and service sector) and household sector (i. e. , urban and
rural household sector) in our decomposition analysis framework. 
To study the driving forces of CO2 emissions of China, the variables including energy structure, energy intensity by sector, GDP, industrialization rate, urbanization rate, population, and urban and
rural disposable income per capita are chosen in this study. 4 The
details are as follows. 
3. 2. 2. 1.  Energy intensity.  During 2000–2015, most regions experienced
an inverted U-shaped evolution trend in energy intensity.  However, energy intensity in Ningxia showed a continuing increase trend.  In 2015,
Ningxia has the highest energy intensity of 273. 56 kg ce/1000 yuan,
followed by Shanxi, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, and the energy intensity of industrial sector reached 1034. 28 kg ce/1000 yuan which was
much higher than other regions in China.  Energy intensity of Beijing in
2015 is lowest among regions.  Energy intensity by sector of China's 30
regions in 2015 are shown in Table A. 3 in Appendix. 
3. 2. 2. 2.  GDP.  The data for GDP and value-added of various sectors from
2000 to 2015 are converted to the 2000 constant price to eliminate
the effect of inﬂation.  Compared with that of 2000, China's GDP in
2015 increased by 4. 08 times.  In general, Guangdong has the largest
scale of GDP, while Ningxia has the lowest scale of GDP.  During 2000–
2015, average annual growth rate of GDP for each region exceed 10%,
in which it reached 14. 79% in Inner Mongolia.  GDP of China's 30 regions
are shown in Table A. 4 in Appendix. 
3. 2. 2. 3.  Industrialization.  Industrial sector consumes large amount of fossil energy resource, and thus emits large amount of CO2.  Value-added of
industrial sector affects CO2 emissions severely.  This study uses industrialization rate, i. e. , the ratio of industrial value-added to total GDP, to
measure the change of industrial structure.  Industrialization rate of
Heilongjiang and Tianjin are larger than other regions in China, whereas
Hainan is the lowest during 2000–2015.  Due to the development of
service sector, the share of industrial value-added in most regions
declined in recent years.  Industrialization rate of China's 30 regions
are shown in Table A. 5 in Appendix. 
3. 2. 2. 4.  Urbanization.  Urbanization is the important factor to inﬂuence
energy consumption and CO2 emissions because residential income
and energy efﬁciency would improve in the process of urbanization. 
This study employs the ratio of urban population to total population
to measure the level of urbanization.  Generally, urbanization rate of
China has been growing from 35. 50% in 2000 to 55. 44% in 2015. 
Shanghai and Beijing are the two regions with highest urbanization
rate of 88. 62% and 86. 42% in 2015, respectively.  However, urbanization
rate in Guizhou remained 41. 01% in 2015.  Urbanization rate of China's
30 regions are shown in Table A. 6 in Appendix. 
3. 2. 2. 5.  Population.  Since NBSC provides the data on year-end population
in urban and rural area, this study takes the average of population at the
beginning and end of the year.  Population in most regions increased
slowly during 2000–2015, with an average annual growth rate of
0. 58%.  However, affected by labor transfer, growth rate of population
reached 4. 33% in Tianjin, 3. 22% in Beijing and 2. 69% in Shanghai. 
Notably, population in Anhui declined during 2000–2015.  Population
of China's 30 regions are shown in Table A. 7 in Appendix. 
3. 2. 2. 6.  Disposable income per capita.  As income rises, more energy resources are consumed to support the use of electrical appliances, and
then more CO2 are emitted.  In this study, disposable income per capita
by eliminating inﬂation is used to measure the real level of income.  During 2000–2015, most regions in China showed high-speed increase in
disposable income per capita, with an average annual growth rate of
8. 85% in urban region and 8. 56% in rural region.  Shanghai and Beijing
are two regions with highest disposable income per capita of both
urban and rural residents.  However, Qinghai has lowest urban disposable income per capita and Gansu is the region with lowest rural disposable income per capita.  Urban and rural disposable income per capita of
China's 30 regions are shown in Tables A. 8 and A. 9 in Appendix. 
3. 3.  Overview of the national and regional CO2 emissions in China. 
This section analyzes the performance of China's CO2 emissions at
both national and regional levels.  First, the evolution trends of national
CO2 emissions in China during 2000–2015 are investigated, and then
the whole study period is divided into different time intervals in
considering the evolution trends of national CO2 emissions.  Second,
CO2 emissions of China's 30 regions and three big regions between
2000 and 2015 are compared. 
3. 3. 1.  National CO2 emissions. 
There has been a signiﬁcant increase in China's CO2 emissions from
3397. 62 million tons (Mt. ) in 2000 to 9403. 00 Mt.  in 2015 at an average
annual growth rate of 7. 02%.  As shown in Fig.  1a, the changes in national
CO2 emissions mainly runs through four stages.  high-speed growth
stage (2000–2005), decreasing-speed growth stage (2006–2008),
steady growth stage (2009–2012) and transition stage (2013–2015). 
During 2000–2005, growth rate of national CO2 emissions increased
from 4. 32% to 16. 90%, and national CO2 emissions showed a sharp
increase, which was deﬁned as high-speed growth stage.  However,
growth rate of national CO2 emissions declined signiﬁcantly from
2006 to 2008, and the time interval can be deﬁned as the decreasingspeed growth stage.  China experienced a steady increase in CO2
emissions during 2009–2012, and the growth rate remained between
5. 76% and 6. 65%, which was deﬁned as the steady growth stage.  During
2013–2015, growth rate of national CO2 emissions declined, and even
became the negative value of −0. 87% in 2014 and −4. 09% in 2015. 
This special stage was deﬁned as the transition stage, and was attributed
to the transformation of economic development patterns.  In short, this
division of growth stage helps to understand the evolution trends of
national CO2 emissions, and also is the basis of conducting the temporal
and spatial decomposition analysis of national and regional CO2
emissions in this study. 
Share of CO2 emissions from fossil energy consumption or process
remained largely unchanged during 2000–2015 (Fig.  1b).  During the
whole study period, coal-related CO2 emissions accounted for a substantial part of 74. 50%–79. 50% in national CO2 emissions.  The high
share of coal-related CO2 emissions was ascribed to the abundant coal
resource reserve, coal-dominated energy structure and power structure
in China (Ouyang and Lin, 2015.  Zhang Name, 2016).  Share of oil-related
CO2 emissions declined from 17. 63% to 11. 19% during 2000–2011, and
rebounded during 2011–2015.  Share of CO2 emissions from industrial
production process in national CO2 emissions were relatively small.  In
general, gas-related CO2 emissions experienced an upward trend, in
which CO2 emissions from the combustion of natural gas climbed
from 1. 30% to 3. 22% during 2000–2015. 
Fig.  1c shows the national CO2 emissions from different sectors
during 2000–2015.  CO2 emissions in the power sector and manufacturing sector accounted for approximately 40% of national CO2 emissions,
respectively, which were the two largest industrial CO2 emitters.  Transport sector was the third largest industrial CO2 emitter, and its share in
national CO2 emissions ﬂuctuated slightly between 6. 00%–6. 82% during
2000–2015.  Share of CO2 emissions from urban residents showed a
decline trend from 4. 24% in 2000 to 2. 20% 2015.  However, share of
CO2 emissions from rural residents experienced an inverted U-shaped
growth trend, increasing from 1. 52% in 2000 to 2. 96% in 2003 and
declining to 1. 78% in 2015.  Except for a few years, share of CO2
emissions from urban residents were higher than that of rural residents
during 2000–2015. 
3. 3. 2.  Regional CO2 emissions. 
CO2 emissions among China's 30 regions varied signiﬁcantly, seen in
Fig.  2.  The top ten regions in term of CO2 emissions include Shandong,
Hebei, Jiangsu, Inner Mongolia, Henan, Liaoning, Shanxi, Guangdong,
Zhejiang, and Hubei.  Sum of CO2 emissions in these ten regions, on average, accounted for 58. 65% of national CO2 emissions during 2000–
2015.  Shandong province contributed most of 8. 75% to national CO2
emissions accumulatively during 2000–2015, followed by Hebei
(7. 82%) and Jiangsu (6. 93%).  Energy-related CO2 emissions of some regions in China exceeded national energy-related CO2 emissions of
some developed countries.  For example, CO2 emissions in Shandong
(742. 32 Mt. ), Hebei (720. 77 Mt. ) and Jiangsu (647. 87 Mt. ) provinces
in 2014 were higher than that of Canada (554. 80 Mt. ) and Australia
(373. 80 Mt. ).  However, CO2 emissions in some regions, such as Qinghai
and Hainan, accounted for a small part of less than 0. 5% in national CO2
emissions. 
Such a big difference in CO2 emissions among regions lies in different
socio-economic development condition, i. e. , the levels of economic
development, industrialization, urbanization, population, and energy
resources endowment.  Regions, such as Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong,
Zhejiang emitted large amount of CO2 emissions, which were mainly
attributed the high level of economic output, industrialization and
urbanization.  Some regions, such as Inner Mongolia and Shanxi were
less developed, but consumed massive fossil energy resource and
induced large amount of CO2 emissions in developing the economy. 
That was largely because these regions were abundant in energy
resource and thus develop resource-based industrial structure.  In
addition, CO2 emissions in Hebei and Henan provinces also accounted
for a large proportion of national CO2 emissions because of the higher
level of economic output and population. 
A comparison of regional CO2 emissions in 2000 and in 2015 indicates that, CO2 emissions in most regions experienced a sharp increase
during 2000–2015.  After China's joining into World Trade Organization,
national and regional economy developed rapidly, and industrialization
and urbanization were increasingly deepening.  Consequently, huge
amount of fossil energy resource were consumed to support the rapid
economic development, and induced massive CO2 emissions of the
regions.  Resource-based regions showed most signiﬁcant increase in
CO2 emissions during 2000–2015.  CO2 emissions in Inner Mongolia,
Shaanxi and Xinjiang increased from 105. 95 Mt. , 58. 91 Mt.  and
65. 38 Mt.  in 2000 to 585. 71 Mt. , 272. 83 Mt.  and 243. 94 Mt.  in 2015,
and corresponding average annual growth rate reached 12. 07%, 10. 76%
and 9. 17%, respectively.  Coal-dominated energy structure and rapid development of resource-based industry drove to rapid increase in energy
consumption and CO2 emissions of resource-based regions.  CO2 emissions in Hainan, Fujian and Shandong also increased considerably during 2000–2015.  In contrast, CO2 emissions increased slowly in most
developed regions like Beijing, Shanghai and Taiwan, and the average
annual growth rate of CO2 emissions in these regions during
2000–2015 were below 3. 50%.  On one hand, the developed regions
had come into the post-industrial stage, and modern service industry
was the primary engine of economic development.  On the other hand,
large decline in coal consumption occurred in Beijing and Shanghai
due to the transformation of energy development patterns and the
adjustment of energy structure (Xu Name, 2016). 
When China's 30 regions are regrouped into three big regions,
i. e. , eastern region, central region and western region, CO2 emissions
at the three regions are also investigated.  The eastern region contributed most of 48. 96% to national CO2 emissions during 2000–2015, followed by central region of 33. 44% and western region of 17. 60%.  Provinces
with larger CO2 emissions are mainly located in eastern region while
provinces with lower CO2 emissions were largely in western region. 
However, differences in CO2 emissions per capita among three big
regions are relatively small, and the differences between eastern region
and western region, eastern region and central region dropped from
32. 04% and 12. 47% in 2000 to 20. 32% and 5. 45% in 2015, respectively. 
Considering the great differences in CO2 emissions among regions,
Chinses government should pay more attention to regional CO2 emissions, and thus formulate differentiated emission-reduction policies at
regional level in order to reduce China's CO2 emissions sharply. 
4.  Results. 
4. 1.  Temporal decomposition analysis. 
The temporal decomposition analysis model is employed to analyze
the underlying driving forces of national and regional energy-related
CO2 emissions during 2000–2015.  This section decomposes the changes
of CO2 emissions of each time interval (i. e. , 2000–2005, 2006–2008,
2009–2012 and 2013–20,015) to explore the main driving forces and
discover the reasons behind of the changes. 
4. 1. 1.  Temporal decomposition results of national CO2 emissions. 
During 2000–2015, national energy-related CO2 emissions increased
by 5828. 62 Mt. , a growth rate of 201. 67%.  The temporal decomposition
results (see Table 3) revealed that economic scale effect (ΔC_A) was the
dominant driving force that leads to the increase in national CO2 emissions while energy intensity effect in the production sector (ΔC_EGI)
and energy structure effect (ΔC_ES) were the main factors to reduce national CO2 emissions, which was in line with an array of previous studies, such as S.  Xu Name (2014), X.  Xu Name (2014), Zhang and Da (2015),
Wang Name (2015), Wang and Chao (2017). 
Accumulative contribution of ΔC_A reached 9195. 62 Mt.  which
accounted for 157. 77% of the change of national CO2 emissions, and
contribution of ΔC_EGI and ΔC_ES were −4098. 44 Mt.  and −
1357. 73 Mt.  which accounted for −70. 32% and −23. 29% of the change
of national CO2 emissions, respectively.  During 2000–2015, China's GDP
increased by 3. 08 times, and massive energy were consumed to support
it which induced large amount of CO2 emissions.  However, energy intensity decreased signiﬁcantly from 91. 73 kg ce/1000 yuan in 2000 to
58. 09 kg ce/1000 yuan in 2015, a growth rate of −36. 67%, which was
mainly attributed to technology progress, capital-energy substitution
and government polices (such as the phase-out and retirement of
small-scale thermal power units and the elimination of backward production capacity) (Lin and Du, 2014.  Yang and Lin, 2016).  In addition,
China has implemented strong policies to encourage gas to replace
coal consumption in the industry and household sectors, and has used
substantial subsidies to stimulate the deployment of non-fossil energy
(Yang Name, 2014.  Qi Name, 2016).  During 2000–2015, the share of
natural gas and renewable energy in energy consumption increased
from 2. 20%, 73. 0% to 5. 90%, and 12. 00%, respectively, and the coal
share decreased from 68. 50% to 64. 00% (CNBS).  The signiﬁcant
improvement of energy structure in China in the past decades played
an important role in restricting the increase in national CO2 emissions. 
Industrial structure effect (ΔC_S), population scale effect (ΔC_P)
and income improvement effect (ΔC_Y) were responsible for the increase in national CO2 emissions, and the corresponding proportion in
the national CO2 emission change during 2000–2015 were 21. 51%
(1253. 45 Mt. ), 10. 87% (633. 40 Mt. ) and 6. 48% (377. 60 Mt. ), respectively.  The improvement of disposal income and living standards in the
household sector increased fossil energy consumption for cooking,
warming and transportation.  During 2000–2015, energy consumption
in the household sector increased by 2. 00 times, leading to the rapid
increase in CO2 emissions. 
Energy intensity effect in the household sector (ΔC_EYI) contributed
to the reduction of national CO2 emissions, accounting for −3. 30% of the
change of national CO2 emissions.  This result was supported by Dai Name
(2012) and Qi Name (2016), because the spending on necessities
(including energy) decreased with the growth of income.  While
urbanization effect increased national CO2 emissions, accounting for
0. 30% of the change of national CO2 emissions.  The urbanization process
promoted CO2 emissions by infrastructure construction, the development of industrial and transport sectors, population aggregation and
the increasing residential energy consumption due to rural-to-urban
migration (Li Name, 2011.  Zi Name, 2016.  Ouyang and Lin, 2015).  However, the two effects of the improvement of both energy intensity and of
the urbanization played minor roles in the change of national CO2
emissions during 2000–2015. 
During 2000–2005, 2006–2008 and 2009–2012, China has
experienced the rapid growth of CO2 emissions, and the increase in CO2
emissions were 2372. 67 Mt. , 1544. 43 Mt. , and 2053. 92 Mt. , respectively. 
In contrast, CO2 emissions of China decreased during 2013–2015, which
was mainly attributed to the transition of economic development
accompanying with the decrease in economic growth rate, signiﬁcant improvement of energy efﬁciency and major adjustment of energy structure.  Energy utilization efﬁciency in China was greatly improved during
2008–2015, and average annual contribution of energy intensity effect including ΔC_EGI and ΔC_EYI increased signiﬁcantly from −360. 62 Mt. 
during 2009–2012 to −539. 78 Mt.  during 2013–2015.  The Chinese government took a series of measures to improve the energy utilization efﬁciency after 2005, including improving the energy efﬁciency standards
and discouraging small energy-inefﬁcient units in the power plants, establishing fuel consumption limits, implementing vehicle emissions standards in the transport sector, establishing energy-efﬁcient design
standards for commercial buildings in the service sector (Zhou Name,
2010, 2014.  S.  Xu Name, 2014.  X.  Xu Name, 2014).  However, the average
annual contribution of ΔC_A reduced from 838. 25 Mt.  during 2009–
2012 to 537. 53 Mt.  during 2013–2015.  Contributions of various driving
forces showed an inverted-U shaped growth trend during the four time
interval, and the properties of each driving factor remained unchanged
except for industrial structure effect.  China was entering the postindustrial period along with decreasing share of industrial value-added
and increasing share of value-added in service sector, ΔC_S turned from
a positive driving force during the ﬁrst three sub-periods to a negative
one (−84. 31 Mt. ) during 2013–2015. 
4. 1. 2.  Temporal decomposition results of regional CO2 emissions. 
Based on the temporal decomposition analysis model, CO2 emissions
for each region are decomposed to reveal the main driving forces of the
changes of regional CO2 emissions.  Accumulative contributions of various driving forces of CO2 emissions for each region are provided in
Fig.  3.  Although the changes of both scale and increment of CO2
emissions among regions varied sharply during 2000–2014, the
decomposition results indicated that the main driving forces of the
changes of CO2 emissions of various regions were roughly same as the
decomposition results at the national level.  Considering the increment
of CO2 emissions, contributions of various driving forces, and
emission-socioeconomic features, China's 30 regions were classiﬁed
into 5 categories as follows. 
The ﬁrst group includes ﬁve regions.  Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Anhui
and Sichuan.  These ﬁve regions share the similar socioeconomic
development characteristics (i. e. , large economic scale but low level of
industrialization and urbanization and technology, and huge amount
of population), and thus shows high level of ΔC_A, ΔC_S and ΔC_EGI,
ΔC_U and ΔC_Y compared with other regions.  Rapid industrial
development and large economic increment induced massive energy
consumption and CO2 emissions in these regions during 2000–2014. 
For example, ΔC_A reached 639. 70 Mt.  in Hebei province during
2000–2014, next to Shandong province (827. 69 Mt. ) and Jiangsu
province (650. 10 Mt. ).  Henan province showed the largest ΔC_EGI of
−256. 60 Mt.  among regions during 2000–2014, followed by Hebei
province (−243. 55 Mt. ).  Low energy efﬁciency mainly due to low
energy utilization technology left large room to improve it, which
contributed to the reduction of CO2 emissions in these regions (Han
Name, 2016).  With rapid improvement of urbanization rate and resident
income increased signiﬁcantly in Hebei and Anhui provinces.  ΔC_U in
Hebei was the largest (2. 15 Mt. ) among regions during the study period,
followed by Anhui (2. 13 Mt. ).  ΔC_P was positive in Hebei, Henan and
Liaoning, while was negative in Sichuan and Anhui. 
The second group is highly resource-based regions, including Inner
Mongolia, Shanxi, Xinjiang, Shaanxi and Ningxia.  ΔC_ES in Inner
Mongolia reached −100. 51 Mt.  during 2000–2014, accounting for
21. 65% of the total change of CO2 emissions.  This was mainly attributed
to the large-scale development and utilization of renewable energy in
the last few years (Liu Name, 2013.  Xin Name, 2015).  ΔC_EGI was relatively large in Inner Mongolia (−219. 13 Mt. ), which was attributed to
eliminate backward production facilities, construct major energysaving project etc.  (NDRC, 2011).  ΔC_S in Inner Mongolia was positive
and largest (133. 48 Mt. ) among regions.  Accumulative ΔC_EGI was positive in Xinjiang (59. 01 Mt. ) during 2000–2014 because the rapid development of industry sector in the context of Western Development
strategy increased the energy intensity of industry sector (Guo Name,
2016.  Wang Name, 2017). 
The third group includes four regions with highly developed and
large scale of economy,
i. e. , Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong and
Zhejiang.  The most outstanding feature was the large ΔC_A andin these four regions.  Shandong had largest ΔC_A of
827. 69 Mt.  and ΔC_EGI of −407. 77 Mt.  As the largest CO2 emitter
among regions, Shandong province have been focusing on improving
energy efﬁciency since 11th Five-Year planning.  Central government
and Shandong provincial government shut down large number of
thermal power units and cement enterprises with small scale or
backward production capacity, and provided ﬁnancial support and
implemented resource tax and value-added tax to promote the research
and development of new energy-saving technology.  However, because
of the large economic output and much higher growth rate of economy
the increase in CO2 emissions in Shandong during 2000–2014 reached
566. 56 Mt. , which ranked the ﬁrst among regions.  Additionally, ΔC_P
in these four regions played a greater effect on the increase in CO2
emissions compared with other regions.  The key reason for this increase
was the transformation of the surplus labor forces from economically
underdeveloped regions in the west and northwest to developed coastal regions in the east.  Especially in Guangdong province, ΔC_P reached
the maximum of 79. 17 Mt.  among regions because of the signiﬁcant
increase in population of 20. 88 million persons during 2000–2014. 
The forth group includes the four regions in China, i. e. , Beijing,
Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing.  These regions were the most
developed areas in China but had little contribution to national CO2
emissions, which was attributed high contribution of ΔC_EGI and
ΔC_ES.  Contribution of ΔC_EGI and ΔC_ES during 2000–2014 reached
−308. 68% and −246. 90% in Beijing and −160. 19%, −183. 43% in
Shanghai, respectively, which effectively restrained the growth of CO2
emissions.  Beijing and Shanghai had greater service sector, and the
average contributions of service sector to regional GDP reached
63. 08% in Beijing and 53. 38% in Shanghai.  Beijing has made great effort
to eliminate backward production capacity and industrial enterprises
and old vehicles with high pollution and energy consumption, and
introduced advanced energy-saving technology during 2000–2014.  In
addition, after the startup of “coal to clean energy” project since 2001
and the increase in share of purchased power, the coal consumption
in Beijing sharply decreased.  Except the traditional energy-saving and
emission reduction measures, Shanghai also focused on starting key
energy-saving project and building energy-saving.  ΔC_EGI and ΔC_ES
also substantially reduced CO2 emissions in Tianjin and Chongqing
during 2000–2014.  ΔC_A in these four regions were relatively small
compared with the ﬁrst three groups. 
The remaining regions belong to the last group.  These regions are located in the northwest and southwest of China, and are less undeveloped regions in China.  The change of CO2 emissions for each region in
this group was relatively small.  Less developed socio-economic development condition resulted in relatively small ΔC_A, ΔC_EGI, ΔC_EYI
and ΔC_ES.  ΔC_P in these regions was also small because the labor
force transferred from these regions to the developed regions. 
ΔC_EGI during 2013–2014 played a greater effect on the CO2 emissions than the other time intervals.  During 2013–2014, ΔC_EGI reduced
CO2 emissions in Shandong province by 96. 82 Mt.  annually, higher than
that of 55. 81 Mt.  during 2009–2012, 31. 47 Mt.  during 2006–2008, respectively.  Notably, ΔC_EGI were positive in some regions like Shandong, Hebei and Shanxi during 2000–2005, which was related to the
increasing proportion of the value-added of industry sector in GDP.  Similarly, EYI were positive in some regions during 2006–2008 due to the
increasing expenditure on energy consumption, and the average annual
EYI showed an increasing trend among regions during 2006–2014. 
However, EYI in Hebei province was positive during 2013–2014,
which was related to the increase in the expenditure on energy
consumption of rural sector. 
Contributions by time interval of various driving forces on CO2 emissions for each region are provided in Fig.  4.  In terms of the changes of
CO2 emissions at different time intervals, ΔC_ES in most regions were
positive during 2000–2005.  The key reason was that the coal consumption among regions increased signiﬁcantly, and the national average
share of coal consumption in total energy consumption increased
from 68. 50% in 2000 to 72. 40% in 2005 (China's National Bureau of
Statistics, 2000).  For example, the share of coal consumption in
Shandong and Hebei increased from 52. 61%, 78. 44% in 2000 to 66. 34%,
and 81. 03% in 2005, the effects of energy structure degradation reached
338. 84 Mt.  and 213. 14 Mt.  during 2000–2005, respectively.  However,
along with the large-scale development of renewable energy since
2006 and the deployment of a series of energy-saving and emissionreduction policies, the energy structure improved signiﬁcantly among
regions during 2006–2014.  Especially in Liaoning during 2009–2012,
energy structure effect reached the largest value of −107. 80 Mt. 
among regions. 
ΔC_S played a signiﬁcant role in promoting the increase in CO2 emissions among regions during 2000–2008.  However, with the rapid development of service sector in developed regions, ΔC_S turned to be
negative during 2009–2012.  Ultimately, ΔC_S were negative during
2013–2014 except some less developed regions, such as Inner
Mongolia, Jilin, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi and Guizhou.  Obviously, industry
sector would be the major source to regional economic development
in these less developed regions. 
ΔC_U had an inverted U-shaped evolution trends during the four
time intervals, in most regions, which was consistent with the previous
studies, such as Zi Name (2016).  After living in urban areas, the rural
households used fossil fuels instead of bioenergy for cooking and boiling
water (Parikh and Shukla, 1995), and the private transportation also developed rapidly, which required more gasoline and diesel (Jones, 2004). 
However, urbanization could also reduce residential direct energy demand by promoting the utilization of efﬁcient appliances, central
heating systems, and fuel-efﬁcient transportation (Ma, 2015.  Zang
Name, 2017).  ΔC_U in highly developed regions such as Beijing, Shanghai
and Tianjin were always negative during 2000–2014.  However, in
Jiangsu province and some less developed regions, ΔC_U was positive
and decreasing. 
ΔC_A in most regions showed a decreasing trend during the four
time intervals.  The decreasing growth rate of economy among regions
resulted from the adjustment of economic structure, and another possible reason was that China's economic growth was close to its steady
state according to Solow model (Song Name, 2011).  However, ΔC_P
was decreasing in most regions during the four time intervals.  This
was attributed to the one-child policy implemented in China, which
decreased the growth rate of population in various regions.  However,
ΔC_P in most developed regions showed a growing trend due to labor
transfer from less develop regions to the developed regions.  For
example, the average annual contribution of ΔC_P increased from
2. 9 Mt.  during 2000–2005 to 11. 18 Mt.  during 2009–2012. 
Generally, ΔC_Y was decreasing in most regions during the four time
intervals due to decreasing expenditure on fossil energy.  However, the
average annual contribution of ΔC_Y in Xinjiang increased from
0. 55 Mt.  during 2009–2012 to 0. 77 Mt.  during 2013–2014, which
indicated that the improvement of income promoted the fossil energy
consumption in household sector. 
4. 1. 3.  Temporal decomposition results of CO2 emissions in three big regions. 
As shown in Fig.  5, temporal decomposition of the changes of CO2
emissions indicate that strong similarities of contribution of variables
exist in three big regions.  Contribution degree of various variables, including direction and magnitude, between eastern region and central
region are roughly same.  In eastern and central regions, contribution
of ΔC_A during 2000–2014 are −66. 65% and −66. 66%, respectively,
and contribution of ΔC_ES are −25. 45% and −22. 57%, respectively. 
Economic growth and energy structure adjustment in western region
contributed less to national CO2 emissions than that in eastern and central regions.  However, contribution of ΔC_P in eastern region (14. 58%)
is far greater than that of central region (6. 87%) and western region
(4. 89%) because labor transfer from central region and western region
to eastern region resulted in rapid population growth in eastern region. 
ΔC_Y and ΔC_EYI in western region contributed a larger part to its CO2
emissions compared with the eastern region and central region.  In addition, absolute effects of various variables vary signiﬁcantly, and CO2
emissions and the effects of variables in eastern region are larger than
the level of central region and western region.  However,
ΔC_A, ΔC_EGI and ΔC_ES differed greatly among the three regions
during four study period.  During 2000–2005, ΔC_ES is 1246. 32 Mt.  in
eastern region, larger than that of 740. 40 Mt.  in central region and
385. 95 Mt.  in western region.  In addition, ΔC_A in eastern region
(1087. 75 Mt. ) is also greater than the level of central region
(742. 25 Mt. ) and western region (329. 18 Mt. ).  However, contribution
degrees of ΔC_A, ΔC_EGI and ΔC_ES in three regions are still similar
during the study period. 
4. 2.  Spatial decomposition analysis. 
The M-R spatial decomposition model is adopted to analyze the
differences in energy-related CO2 emissions among regions during
2000–2014.  This section decomposes the differences in energy-related
CO2 emissions between China's 30 regions, three big regions and the
national average into nine kinds of effects of driving forces.  The possible
potential of emission-reduction of various regions is evaluated. 
4. 2. 1.  Spatial decomposition results of China's 30 regions. 
CO2 emissions of China's 30 regions in 2000, 2005, 2008, 2012, and
2014 are sorted from big to small, and the corresponding group average
CO2 emissions are calculated (seen Table A. 11).  In this study, the national
average CO2 emissions are given by arithmetic average CO2 emissions of
China's 30 regions.  Then we compare the CO2 emissions of each region
with the national average CO2 emissions.  The differences of the CO2 emissions in 2000, 2005, 2008, 2012, and 2014 are decomposed into eight
driving forces (excluding ΔC_CI) by applying M-R spatial decomposition
analysis model, and the effect of each driving forces is calculated based on
Eqs.  (13)–(21).  The positive or negative value of the effects of different
factors has different meanings.  For example, economic output (GDP) is
size-dependent, positive value of economic scale effect indicates the
GDP of a region is higher than the national average, while the positive
value of energy intensity effect indicates that the region is less efﬁcient in
energy use than national average level. 
The spatial decomposition results (Fig.  5) show that ΔC_A and
ΔC_EGI were the major driving forces of the differences in CO2 emissions between the regions and the national average, while ΔC_ES and
ΔC_S were also important factors responsible for the differences in
CO2 emissions between regions and the national average.  Other factors,
such as ΔC_Y, ΔC_Y, ΔC_U and ΔC_EYI, had minor effects on the differences in regional CO2 emissions. 
Shandong, Jiangsu and Guangdong had the largest ΔC_A.  The GDP of
these three regions were highly greater than the national average level,
and thus consumed larger energy resource and emitted mount of CO2
than the average.  For example, ΔC_A in Shandong province reached
474. 03 Mt.  in 2014, which was equivalent to 106. 62% of the difference
in CO2 emissions between Shandong and the national average
(444. 60 Mt. ).  Yet GDP in regions like Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang,
Gansu, Guizhou and Shanxi were considerably smaller than national average level, which resulted in the larger and negative effect of economicThe highly resource-based regions, such as Shanxi, Inner Mongolia,
Xinjiang and Ningxia, had great higher ΔC_EGI than the national average.  Shan Name (2016) revealed that Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia
were important base of coal production in China, with many large coal
mines, and high energy production and consumption and less
developed technological level, which caused low energy efﬁciency and
thus high energy consumption and CO2 emissions in these regions.  For
example, ΔC_EGI in Shanxi province was 500. 72 Mt.  That meant that
higher energy intensity (or low energy efﬁciency) in Shanxi province
resulted in the higher CO2 emissions of 500. 72 Mt.  than the national
level.  That is, CO2 emissions in Shanxi province would reduce by
500. 72 Mt.  if the energy efﬁciency rises to the national average level. 
In contrast, energy intensity in economically developed eastern coastal
regions including Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang and Fujian
were far blew the national average level, and ΔC_EGI in these regions
were negative and sharply lower than the national average. 
ΔC_ES indicated the effect of the differences in economic structure
among regions, and it would increase if contribution of industrial (or
heavy industrial) value-added went up.  Highly developed or undeveloped regions had larger but negative ΔC_ES compared with the national
average.  The contribution of service sector on regional GDP were higher
than that of industry sector in socio-economic developed regions such
as Beijing and Shanghai, while in highly undeveloped west regions in
China agriculture sector contributed a large part to regional GDP.  For
example, ΔC_ES in Beijing was −113. 30 Mt.  in 2014, which revealed
that low carbon energy structure in Beijing reduced CO2 emissions by
113. 30 Mt.  in 2014 than the national level. 
The differences of CO2 emissions between the regions and the
national average cause by ΔC_P, ΔC_U and ΔC_Y were small.  The key
reason for this was that the CO2 emissions from household sector
accounted for a relatively small part of regional CO2 emissions. 
When investigating the trends of the differences in CO2 emissions
between among regions and the driving forces resulting in the differences, we ﬁnd the differences in both CO2 emissions and the effects of
various factors were growing during 2000–2014.  For example, the gap
of CO2 emissions between Shandong province and the national average
level increased from 76. 10 Mt.  in 2000 to 444. 60 Mt.  in 2014 while the
gap of CO2 emissions between Qinghai province and the national average level increased from −87. 99 Mt.  in 2000 to −254. 67 Mt.  in 2014. 
Due to the adjustment of industrial structure and improvement of energy efﬁciency, the energy intensity decreased from 70. 34 kg ce/1000
yuan to 31. 72 kg ce/1000 yuan, and the gap of CO2 emissions caused
by ΔC_EGI between Beijing and the national average increased from
−13. 50 Mt.  in 2000 to −66. 46 Mt.  in 2014.  This founding revealed
the increasing differences in socio-economic development (such as
economic development, energy structure and income improvement)
among China's 30 regions. 
4. 2. 2.  Performance ranking. 
In order to investigate the social-economic development status and
the potential of emission-reduction regions of China's 30 regions, this
section ranks the effects of various driving forces of each region from
big to small.  Actually, this ranking is the comparison of economic
output, energy efﬁciency or income improvement.  For example, the
smaller number of ΔC_A means the higher economic output while the
smaller number of energy intensity effect indicates the lower energy efﬁciency of the regions.  Ang (2015) also pointed out that the factors of
the regions ranked at the top of the list (such as larger positive value
of energy intensity effect or industrial structure effect of some regions)
have potential of higher energy-saving or emission-reduction if proper
measures (such as industrial structure adjustment or energy efﬁciency
improvement) are taken. 
Combing Fig.  6 and Table 5, the emission-reduction potential of
China's 30 regions in future can be evaluated and the directions of policy
implementation were also provided.  The smaller number of regions
revealed greater emission-reduction potential, and government should
take efﬁcient measures to reduce CO2 emissions of these regions.  For
example, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang ranked in the top three
in terms of ΔC_EGI in 2014, which indicated that energy efﬁciency
could be improved and CO2 emissions could also be reduced signiﬁcantly in the three regions.  In addition, some less developed regions such as
Guizhou and Hebei shows greater emission-reduction potential in
terms of ΔC_EGI.  However, Guangdong, Shandong, Heilongjiang and
Jiangsu provinces ranked in the top four regions in terms of ΔC_S,
which showed the signiﬁcant potential of emission-reduction by
optimizing the economic structure in these regions.  Chinese government should put emphasis on the quality of economic development in
high-scale economic output regions such as Shandong, Jiangsu and
Guangdong.  In addition, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Beijing ranked in the
top three in terms of ΔC_Y.  It indicated the higher energy consumption
and CO2 emissions due to the improvement of income, which left large
room to reduce the CO2 emissions by guiding the consumption of lowcarbon energy. 
4. 2. 3.  Spatial decomposition results of three big regions. 
In this study, M-R spatial decomposition method is also
employed to explore the factors responsible for the differences
among three big regions of China.  As shown in Fig.  7, ΔC_EGI was
negative in eastern region but was positive in central and western
regions, indicating that eastern region had a higher energy efﬁciency than central and western regions.  In contrast, ΔC_A was positive
in eastern region and was negative in central and western regions,
which showed the larger CO2 emissions due to economic output
in eastern region.  Obviously, ΔC_A and ΔC_EGI were the most signiﬁcant driving forces of the differences in CO2 emissions among
the three regions.  In 2014, ΔC_A resulted in a higher CO2 emissions
of 1393. 80 Mt.  in eastern region than the average, while induced a
lower CO2 emissions of 1182. 48 Mt.  in western region than the average.  In addition, effects of each driving force showed an increasing trend. 
Generally, western and central regions share the similar characteristic of leading to the lower CO2 emissions than the eastern region.  The
negative ΔC_A is the dominant driving force leading to lower CO2
emissions in central and western regions, while the positive ΔC_EGI is
an important factors increasing CO2 emissions of the two regions. 
ΔC_ES and ΔC_S also become the important driving force affecting the
differences in CO2 emissions between central, western regions and
eastern region in 2014,and it revealed the widening gap in energy
structure and industrial structure among regions. 
<Conclusion> Discussion. 
The main conclusions which emerges from the present study is that
the impact of economic output, energy intensity, energy structure and
industrial structure on national and regional CO2 emissions is quite
large.  Combined effects of these four factors determine the variations of
national and regional CO2 emissions from the perspective of temporal
and spatial dimension.  Based on the above empirical analysis in
Section 4, we make a further discussion on two issues.  (1) What are
the deep-rooted reasons of the four factors with larger effect on
China's CO2 emissions.  (2) How about the future tendency of contribution of various factors to China's CO2 emissions. 
5. 1.  Effects of key factors on China's CO2 emissions. 
Main contribution to China's CO2 emissions are from production
sectors, which accounted for approximately 95. 57% of national CO2
emissions during the whole study period.  The key factors are all
involved in production activity, which is the direct reason of the large
effects on CO2 emissions.  However, the deep-rooted reasons are as
follows. 
(1) Production activity would result in energy consumption where
energy is combusted to support the operation of machinery
equipment and is put into production as material.  Production
activity is the direct factor of energy consumption and CO2
emissions, and the differences in economic output among
China’30 regions led to the signiﬁcant differences in CO2 emissions.  Various regions of China experienced a rapid increase in
economic output, which induced the signiﬁcant increase in CO2
emissions among regions.  Therefore, production activity is the
dominated factors responsible for the variations of CO2 emissions
from the perspective of temporal and spatial dimension. 
(2) Other three factors of energy intensity, energy structure and
industrial structure, to some extent, also have a greater effect
on regional energy consumption and CO2 emissions.  Due to the
large differences in energy efﬁciency, energy structure and
industrial structure of China's 30 regions, effects of the three
factors on CO2 emissions among regions varied sharply.  Three
factors of China's 30 regions changed rapidly along with socialeconomic development during 2000–2015, and thus resulted in
large effects on CO2 emissions. 
5. 2.  The future trend of the contribution of key factors. 
The future trend of the effects of key factors are discussed, and the
main ﬁndings are as follows. 
(1) The effect of economic growth would decrease in the expected
future along with the decline in economic growth of most
regions in China.  Total CO2 emissions in regions are mainly determined by real economic output, while contribution or the increment of CO2 emissions among regions lies in growth rate of
economic output.  According to China's economic development
planning, the absolute contribution of economic scale would
decline increasingly.  However, the contribution degree or relative contribution would increase because of the rapid adjustment
of energy structure and industrial structure, which is supported
by empirical results of China's developed regions with cleanenergy-dominated energy structure and service-dominated
industrial structure in this study. 
(2) Both effect of energy intensity improvement and contribution degree would increase in the expected future.  This is mainly because
China have paid more attention to energy efﬁciency improvement
since 2008, and have strengthened the scientiﬁc research investment, introduced new energy-saving and low carbon technology
to reduce national and regional CO2 emissions.  Along with the increase of the pressure of emission-reduction due to tighter emission allowances, cleaner production technology would be widely
employed to production process.  In addition, the investment of
cleaner production technology in the early stage would play a
greater effect on emission-reduction because employees need to
spend time on understanding how to operate, maintain and
exclude small faults a new production facility when introduced. 
(3) Effect of energy structure improvement and the contribution
degree would also increase along with large-scale use of renewable energy.  Because renewable energy technology continues to
mature applications, the share of renewable energy in total
energy consumption of China increase signiﬁcantly.  The effect of
energy structure improvement would also increase in the expected future.  Considering the decreasing growth rate of China's CO2
emissions, contribution degree of energy structure effect would
increase. 
(4) Effect of industrial structure adjustment would experience
different changing trends.  Industrial structure effect at national
level and developed eastern region would decrease and become
negative in the post-industrial stage.  However, industrial structure effect in most less developed central and western regions
would continue to grow before 2020. 
6.  Conclusions and policy implications. 
6. 1.  Conclusions. 
This study explores national and regional CO2 emissions in China
using temporal decomposition analysis model and spatial decomposition analysis model.  Both the changes of national and regional CO2 emissions and the differences of CO2 emissions between China's 30 regions
and the national average during 2000–2014 are decomposed nine
kinds of driving forces in order to analyze the main driving forces of
the changes in regional CO2 emissions and the main driving forces
resulting in the differences in CO2 emissions among regions.  The main
conclusions drawn from this study are as follows. 
(1) There has been a signiﬁcant increase in national CO2 emissions
in China during 2000–2014.  National CO2 emissions increased
signiﬁcantly from 3397. 62 Mt.  in 2000 to 9803. 78 Mt.  in 2014,
with an average annual growth rate of 7. 86%.  During the
whole study period, coal-related CO2 emissions accounted for
75. 50%–79. 50% of national CO2 emissions, and its share experienced an inverted U-shaped change trend.  The power sector
and manufacturing sector are the two largest industrial CO2
emitters, accounting for approximately 40% of national CO2
emissions, respectively. 
(2) CO2 emissions in most regions have experienced a rapid increase
during 2000–2014, but there are great differences in CO2
emissions among regions.  The regions with higher CO2 emissions
share the characteristics of socio-economic development of high
economic output, abundant energy resource endowment and
large amount of populations.  However, the growth rate of CO2
emissions in highly developed regions such as Beijing and
Shanghai sharply decreased. 
(3) Economic scale effect is the dominant driving forces of the
changes of national and regional CO2 emissions, while energy intensity effect in the production sector and energy structure effect
are the major factors to reduce the CO2 emissions.  Accumulative
contribution of economic scale effect reaches 9014. 87 Mt. , which
accounts for 149. 22% of the change of national CO2 emissions,
and energy intensity effect in the production sector and energy
structure effect were −3703. 22 Mt.  and −1347. 09 Mt. , which
accounted for −61. 30% and −22. 30% of national CO2 emission
change, respectively.  Industrial structure effect, population
scale effect and income improvement effect are also responsible
for the increase in national CO2 emissions. 
Considering the amount of the changes in CO2 emissions, emissionsocioeconomic features, all regions are classiﬁed into 5 categories.  The
regions share the socio-economic development condition such as large
economic scale but low level of industrialization and urbanization,
relatively backward technical level, and thus showed high level of
economic scale effect, industrial structure effect and energy intensity
effect, urbanization effect and income improvement effect.  Energy intensity effect in production sector is relatively large in resource-based
regions.  However, the regions with highly developed and large scale
of economy had high economic scale effect and energy intensity effect. 
(4) Economic scale effect, energy intensity effect are the major
driving forces that results in difference in CO2 emissions between
the regions and the national average, and industrial structure
effect and energy structure effect are also important factors
responsible for the differences in CO2 emissions among regions. 
Income improvement effect, population scale effect, urbanization
effect and energy intensity effect in household sector play minor
effects on the differences in CO2 emissions among regions.  The
differences in both total CO2 emissions and the effects of various
factors are observed to grow during 2000–2014 due to increasing
differences in social-economic development. 
In addition,
resource-based and less developed regions in China have greater
potential in the reduction of CO2 emissions due to low level of energy utilization efﬁciency and coal-dominated energy structure. 
(5) Eastern region contributed most of 48. 96% to national CO2 emissions during 2000–2015, followed by central region of 33. 44%
and western region of 17. 60%.  Differences in CO2 emissions per
capita among three big regions are relatively small.  In addition,
strong similarities of contribution of variables exist in three big regions.  Contribution degree of various variables,
including
direction and magnitude, between eastern region and central
region are roughly same. 
6. 2.  Policy implications. 
Cooperation and differentiated emission-reduction measures should
be considered to control CO2 emissions of China's regions from the
perspective of both equity and efﬁciency.  Accordingly, the following
two policy suggestions are recommended. 
(1) More attention should be paid to central and western regions
regarding China's emission-reduction.  Most Resource-based
regions and less developed regions are located in the central
and western regions.  These regions with higher energy intensity
have developed coal-dominated energy structure and energyintensive industrial structure, and thus have great potential of
emission-reduction through improving energy efﬁciency, optimizing energy structure and industrial structure.  More importantly, marginal abatement cost in these regions is much lower
than that of the relatively developed eastern region.  Total abatement cost of China as a whole would decrease if Chinese government transfer the focus of emission-reduction from developed
eastern regions to less developed central and western regions. 
The criterion of this study in terms of responsibility sharing of
emission-reduction appears to contradict criterion of Ability to
Pay in Wu Name (2016).  However, if eastern developed regions
choose to provide less developed regions with technical support,
funds and management for emission-reduction, China would
achieve a better emission-reduction and mitigate the economic
loss.  The developed regions with conducive environment and
strong ability to conduct the scientiﬁc research should focus on
developing more energy-efﬁcient processes and products and
cost-effective renewable energy utilization technology.  Central
and western regions make full use of the advanced technology
and funds from eastern region, which not only improves energy
structure and reduces CO2 emissions, but also promotes the
development of local economy, and the improvement of industrial structure and income level in these regions.  In addition,
energy structure would be improved in eastern regions due to
the larger-scale use of clean energy supplied from central and
western regions.  Supporting policy from central and local
government is also necessary to promote the ﬂow of capital
and the transformation of new and high-tech achievements
and to regulate the investment market. 
(2) The developed regions with higher CO2 emissions, economic
output and industry-dominated economic structure should
promote widely use of advanced energy-efﬁcient and low carbon
technology.  Raising the quality and efﬁciency of economic
development in eastern regions seems to be particularly important.  Easter regions can improve the economic structure by developing high value-added processing and manufacturing
industries and modern service industries, which helps to reduce
CO2 emissions signiﬁcantly.  Economic development and
emission-reduction models in eastern regions also offers experience for central and western regions.  In addition, considering
higher income improvement effect of household sector in eastern regions, energy structure improvement and energy-saving
awareness promotion in these regions contribute to large reduction of CO2 emissions.
