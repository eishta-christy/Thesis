Many countries subsidise the production and consumption of fossil
fuels.  Most subsidies are given downstream, to reduce the cost of consuming fossil fuels (Coady Name, 2016).  While these subsidies beneﬁt
fuel consumers, at least in the short run, they also have a number of
negative effects (IEA, 2014).  First, they contribute to ﬁscal imbalances
and thus crowd out other government spending.  Second, subsidies
stimulate excessive fossil fuel consumption contributing to increased
emissions of harmful pollution such as CO2.  Finally, in the long run
low oil prices encourage the development of energy-intensive industries and discourage development of renewable technologies.
