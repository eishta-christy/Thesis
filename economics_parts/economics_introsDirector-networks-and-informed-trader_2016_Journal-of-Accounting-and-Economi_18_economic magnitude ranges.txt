Corporate directors have access to material non-public information, which makes them a potential information source for
professional traders.  Directors are, of course, required to keep sensitive material private: Delaware law recognizes a director's
duty of conﬁdentiality, and corporations have comprehensive policies in place to prevent leaks.  Investors, too, face regulatory
scrutiny and reputational costs if they use inside information in traceable manners, and these safeguards seem to be effective
in some institutional settings (Grifﬁn Name, 2012).  However, sensitive information can travel through education networks from
senior corporate ofﬁcers to mutual fund managers and sell-side analysts (Cohen Name, 2008, 2010).  This raises an important
question: to what extent do director networks transmit information that sophisticated traders are able to exploit. 
We investigate whether the breadth of directors' professional connections systematically affects the likelihood of
information leakage to sophisticated traders.  Well-connected directors interact with scores of people, and unguarded
conversations can easily reveal sensitive facts.  In addition, Larcker Name (2013) show that ﬁrms beneﬁt from more connected
boards because board connections are a conduit of information exchange.  Yet an important competitive advantage of
connected directors stems from their ability to provide insights that would otherwise be inaccessible to less connected
colleagues.  Fulﬁlling this role might require some deliberate sharing of sensitive material.  Sophisticated traders, who gather,
analyze and interpret data from multiple sources, have a comparative advantage when piecing together information about
ﬁrms with highly connected directors.  We therefore study possible information transmission from corporate directors to
sophisticated traders by examining the relation between board connectedness and the informativeness of trades made by
short sellers, option traders, and institutional investors. 
Our results indicate that these investor groups are indeed more informed when trading stocks of companies with more
connected boards.  We measure informed trading as the monthly level of short interest, the ratio of monthly option volume
to stock volume, and weekly order imbalances of institutional traders.  From BoardEx, we obtain the number of ﬁrst-degree
connections for each director, which includes links through educational institutions attended, current and previous employers,
military service and civic institutions.  To ensure that our measure of board connectedness is not driven by factors that
have been documented to affect the ﬁrm's information environment, we ﬁrst aggregate the connections of all board members
and then orthogonalize them with respect to ﬁrm size, board size, ﬁrm age, the number of analysts and institutional
ownership.  We examine portfolios sorted by board connectedness and each of the three measures of informed trading
and ﬁnd that the annualized return difference between the highest and lowest quintile of informed trading in highly connected boards is signiﬁcantly more pronounced compared to the same return difference in ﬁrms with less connected boards. 
The economic magnitude ranges from 4% for option volume and 5. 4% for short interest, to 7.
