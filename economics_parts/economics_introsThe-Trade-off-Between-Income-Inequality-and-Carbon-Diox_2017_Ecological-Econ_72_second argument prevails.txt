1.  Introduction Reducing global poverty and mitigating climate change are two major challenges facing mankind in the twenty-ﬁrst century.  Economic growth leads to absolute poverty reduction, particularly if it is not associated with rising income inequality (e. g.  Dollar and Kraay, 2002.  Bourguignon, 2003).  There is a substantial literature that investigates the relationship between income and carbon dioxide emissions (the main driver behind the increase in global surface temperature).  This literature suggests that economic growth, at least up to a certain level of economic development, increases greenhouse gases (IPCC, 2014.  Jakob et al. , 2014).  Consequently, from the perspective of a developing country, economic growth may alleviate poverty, but intensify climate problems.  A related issue is whether there is also a tradeoff between income inequality and carbon emissions, as stated by Ravallion et al.  (2000).  As we discuss below, the theoretical and empirical literature generates mixed results on this question, pointing to different mechanisms and effects (for a survey see Berthe and Elie, 2015).  Much of this literature is, however, based on econometric methods that are biased in the presence of time-varying unobserved heterogeneity, and on older data on both inequality as well as emissions.  We improve upon the existing literature in both of these respects.  A particular innovation with respect to the existing literature is that we use a group ﬁxed effects estimator (Bonhomme and Manresa, 2015) as opposed to a standard ﬁxed effects estimator.  This grouped ﬁxed effects estimator takes into account that different regions of the world adopt clean technologies at different rates or face different structural challenges and dynamics.  Furthermore, the estimator arguably deals better with endogeneity due to unobserved heterogeneity.  Finally, the within transformation associated with the standard country-based ﬁxed effects estimator would eliminate most of the variation in the Gini data, leaving only the relatively small intertemporal variation (see the literature on the debates on inequality and growth literature, e. g.  Forbes, 2000, Banerjee and Duﬂo, 2003, Scholl and Klasen, 2016).  To the best of our knowledge, only ﬁve papers are closely related to our empirical investigation of the link between per capita carbon dioxide emissions, per capita output, and inequality.  There are also related studies investigating the link between inter-country inequality and emissions (e. g.  Guo, 2013.  Coondoo and Dinda, 2008).  First, Ravallion et al.  (2000) use a pooled OLS model that interacts inequality with a third-order polynomial of income, a time trend, and population size.  The panel data set consists of 42 countries over the period from 1975 to 1992.  The authors use one (average) inequality measure per country.  They ﬁnd that there is a static tradeoff between reducing carbon emissions and reducing income inequality.  Second, Borghesi (2006) applies OLS and ﬁxed effects panel data estimators to a panel data set of 37 countries for the period 1988 to 1995.  He prefers the ﬁxed effects estimator and ﬁnds that inequality does not have an effect on emissions.  For the pooled OLS estimator, he ﬁnds a statistically signiﬁcant negative effect between income inequality and carbon dioxide emissions.  Third, Heerink et al.  (2001) use a cross-section design with 65 country observations from about 1985.  The speciﬁcation includes income, its square, and the Gini coefﬁcient.  Similar to Ravallion et al.  (2000), they ﬁnd that income inequality is negatively associated with carbon emissions per capita.  All three studies rely on the inequality measure from the data set described in Deininger and Squire (1996).  Two further studies use the University of Texas Inequality data which proxies household inequality with the between sector wage inequality in non-agricultural sectors.  Drabo (2011) ﬁnds, in a 2SLS ﬁxed effects framework using 86 countries ﬁnds that inequality increases emissions.  Gassebner et al.  (2008) use extreme bound analysis for a sample of up to 120 countries in 1960–2001 and ﬁnd that inequality is robustly associated with smaller CO2 emissions.  The use of the UTIP data, which relates to a particular aspect of industrial wage inequality, as a proxy for overall inequality is, however, controversial and can lead to biases (Scholl, 2016).  Our analysis uses expanded and improved data from Solt (2009), which is derived from the much broader, more consistent, and more reliable WIDER2 World Income Inequality Database.  This allows us to use a larger set of countries (158) than the existing literature, and observations from 1980 to 2008, which is larger and more recent than most existing studies.  Furthermore, we argue that cross-section estimates based on pooled OLS or related methods are arguably not the most appropriate tools for this analysis, and argue that the group ﬁxed effects estimator (Bonhomme and Manresa, 2015) is more suitable for the analysis.  We also compare our analysis to a standard ﬁxed effects estimator. 3 We ﬁnd that the relationship between income inequality and emissions depends on income levels.  At lower levels of incomes higher income inequality reduces emissions while at higher levels of income, the effect is reversed.  The group ﬁxed effects also generate interesting differentiated time trends linked closely to trends in energy intensity in the different groups.  The rest of the paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 reviews theoretical arguments in the existing literature, emphasizing that the relationship between income inequality and emissions is ambiguous.  Section 3 describes the panel data set.  Section 4 outlines the ﬁxed effects model for our setting, and reveals its shortcoming in the current context.  We then argue that a group ﬁxed effects estimator is more appropriate, and describe that model.  The main results and a sensitivity analysis are presented in Section 5.  Section 6 concludes.  2.  Theory.  Starting in the mid-1990′s, economists have developed several theoretical arguments to explain the relationship between economic inequality and environmental degradation.  For a full review, please see Cushing et al.  (2015) and Berthe and Elie (2015).  Here we only provide a condensed summary of this very large literature.  While some of the arguments entail a positive association, namely the “equality hypothesis” proposed by Boyce (1994), Torras and Boyce (1998) and Borghesi (2006), others argue that greater inequality could also be negatively associated to emissions (Heerink et al. , 2001.  Ravallion et al. , 2000.  Scruggs, 1998).  If the second argument prevails, there will be a tradeoff between redistribution policies and environmental quality.  Boyce (1994) proposes that greater inequality could increase environmental degradation via the impact on the rate of time preference and via a modiﬁed cost-beneﬁt analysis that considers power-weighted costs and beneﬁts.
