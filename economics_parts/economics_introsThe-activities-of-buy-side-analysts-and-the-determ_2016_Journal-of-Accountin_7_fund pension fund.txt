 Introduction Buy-side analysts play an important role in equity markets because their research directly impacts the investing decisions of portfolio managers (Cheng et al. , 2006.  Frey and Herbst, 2014.  Rebello and Wei, 2014).  These analysts usually work for an investment ﬁrm (e. g. , mutual fund, hedge fund, pension fund), and they perform their research activities exclusively for the ﬁrm that employs them.  In contrast to sell-side analysts whose stock recommendations are distributed widely to their clients and who often receive coverage in the business press, buy-side analysts' stock recommendations are not available to anyone outside their own ﬁrm.
