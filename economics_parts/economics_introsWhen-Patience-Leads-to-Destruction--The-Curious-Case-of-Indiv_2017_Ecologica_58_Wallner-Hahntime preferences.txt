Destructive ﬁshing is considered to be one of the most important
problems in marine governance (Clark Name, 2005.  Sethi Name, 2005). 
According to the United Nations Environment Program, about 25% of
ﬁsheries worldwide are in jeopardy of collapse due to destructive ﬁshing (Shakouri Name, 2010).  The threat of destructive ﬁshing, such as
the use of poison, dynamite and illegal nets, is especially devastating
for inshore ﬁsheries in tropical and developing countries where small
communities are engaged in subsistence ﬁshing (Belton and Thilsted,
2014).  The collapse or even serious degradation of local ﬁsheries due
to the use of destructive ﬁshing gears has a very negative impact on
the material well-being of these communities.  As a result, there have
been frequent attempts to persuade ﬁshers who are using destructive
gears to change their behavior, and switch to more environmentallyfriendly ﬁshing gears (Samoilys Name, 2008).  In most cases this involves
policy measures, such as gear-exchange programs or monetary incentives for resource conservation (Verheij Name, 2004).  These policies are
motivated by the assumption that a major motivation for using destructive ﬁshing gear is impatience or short-sightedness (low discount factors) and the lack of availability of high capital stocks. 
This assumption is based on standard economic models of renewable resources, going back to Hotelling (1931), which frame natural resource extraction as an intertemporal optimization problem, where
discount factors1 indicate the value given to expected future consumption.  This implies that, higher discount factors meaning higher valuation
of expected future consumption, leads to lower rates of extraction and
vice versa.  Following Farzin (1984) we refer to this as the conservation
effect.  However Farzin (1984) offers a different point of view and argues
that, for high cost of extraction, the relationship between discount factors and resource extraction is opposite to the generally held one, meaning that higher discount factors result in higher extraction levels and
vice versa.  This is based on the view, that, patient ﬁshers are able to invest more in their extraction capabilities.  We refer to this as the disinvestment effect. 
We add to this discussion by applying the underlying logic of these
models to the speciﬁc context of the adoption of destructive ﬁshing
gears in small-scale artisanal ﬁsheries.  Our main objective is to distinguish between scenarios where the policies based on the conservation
effect are justiﬁed and the conditions under which they are not justiﬁed. 
Typical policies, like livelihood diversiﬁcation or temporal closures with
income compensation, may lead to undesirable effects in a situation
when the disinvestment effect dominates the conservation effect.  We
contribute to solving this conundrum, by providing a better understanding of ﬁsher's motivation to adopt destructive gears and its relationship to individual time preferences. 
This research question is motivated by empirical research in Zanzibar which suggests that patient ﬁshermen have higher extraction level
since they can invest more in their extraction capability (see Javaid Name, 2016).  This surprising ﬁnding triggered some interesting and unanswered questions.  Does the relationship between time preferences and
extraction behavior change depending on the circumstances.  What role
do external factors play in this decision-making.  How do beliefs and
perceptions impact this relationship.  While these questions are motivated and based on empirical research in Zanzibar ﬁsheries, they are
not limited to this case.  The use of destructive ﬁshing gear is common
in other regions as well, such as different parts of East Africa (Guard
and Masaiganah, 1997.  Cinner, 2009.  Wells, 2009), Indonesia and
other parts of Southeast Asia (Cassels Name, 2005.  Burke Name, 2006),
parts of South Asia (Rajasuriya Name, 2004) along with other developing
and developed country ﬁsheries.  For the purpose of this paper we limit
ourselves to focus on the case of destructive ﬁshing gears in small scale
communities with open or shared access to the resource. 
Our model shows that the impact of individual discount factor on the
adoption of destructive ﬁshing gears is mediated by two key factors.  (i)
the nature of destructive gear i. e.  whether the destructive gear is costcutting low-proﬁt gear or whether it is high-cost high-proﬁt ﬁshing
gear, and (ii) the level of social dilemma, meaning the number of people
who share the same resource.  Additionally, we ﬁnd that individual beliefs about the actions of other resource users and future resource condition can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on whether the conservation
effect prevails or not.  Overall, our model helps in clarifying the conditions under which the above mentioned policy measures may be expected to work as intended and conditions where other alternative
policy measures should be adopted. 
2.  Background Information. 
2. 1.  Destructive Extraction Methods. 
Destructive methods are deﬁned as ﬁshing methods, gears or practices whose impact is so indiscriminate and/or irreversible that they
are universally considered destructive irrespective of the environment
in which they are used (FAO 2005–2014).  In more concrete terms,
these destructive ﬁshing gears typically have a higher propensity to
physically damage habitats like corals reefs, capture a high proportion
of juvenile ﬁsh, or target species that are crucial to sustain
(McClanahan and Mangi, 2001.  McClanahan and Mangi, 2004.  Mangi
and Roberts, 2006.  Mangi Name, 2007).  Examples of destructive gears
in small scale ﬁsheries include beach seine, ring nets, explosives/dynamites, spear-guns and poison(Jiddawi and Öhman, 2002.  Cinner, 2009). 
In small-scale ﬁsheries, destructive ﬁshing gears can range from
highly proﬁtable to those which are even less proﬁtable than the traditional gears.  Similarly, in terms of capital costs (both ﬁxed and maintenance), some destructive ﬁshing gears (such as beach seines and
dynamites) are much more expensive than traditional gears, while
others (such as spear guns or poison) are less capital intensive even
compared to most basic traditional gears.  Similar comparison can be
made between labor cost required to maintain and operate destructive
ﬁshing gears (for more details see Mangi Name (2007)).  What drives
people towards these gears is an extremely important and relatively
under-researched question.  It stands to reason that given this variation
in types of destructive gears, different ﬁshers are attracted to different
destructive gears.  Earlier studies argue that destructive gear usage is
often associated with a combination of poverty, low socio-economic
conditions and myopic behavior (Cinner, 2009.  Silva, 2006).  Similarly
others have argued that institutional and normative factors can also
play an important role in destructive gear choice (Wallner-Hahn Name,2. 2.  Destructive Fishing Methods and Time Preferences. 
In economics, time preferences refer to the relative value given to future utility as compared to present utility.  Earlier research shows that
there is a considerable degree of heterogeneity in individual time preferences, some value future consumption very highly while others do
not (Tanaka Name, 2010).
