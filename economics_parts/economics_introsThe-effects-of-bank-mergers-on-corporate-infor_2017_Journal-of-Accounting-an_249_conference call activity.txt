1.  Introduction  We provide evidence on the effects of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the U. S.  on borrowers’ voluntary disclosure of ﬁrm-speciﬁc information to public ﬁnancial markets.  The past three decades have witnessed waves of consolidations  through M&As in the U. S.  banking industry.  This trend has signiﬁcantly reduced the number of banking institutions, and a  few large banks now hold the bulk of assets.  Researchers argue that the consolidation has fundamentally altered the nature  of banks as ﬁnancial intermediaries, both directly by affecting how banks monitor and ﬁnance borrowers (e. g. , changing the  type and nature of products and services banks offer), and indirectly by affecting borrowers’ demand for products and services from alternative (public) ﬁnancial markets.  Evidence on how bank mergers affect borrowers’ disclosure adds to our  understanding of their consequences, and contributes to the growing literature that seeks to understand how ﬁrms’ incentive to produce and disseminate public information is affected by various institutional mechanisms in a country’s ﬁnancial  markets (e. g. , Ball et al. , 20 0 0.  Leuz et al. , 2003.  Bushman et al. , 2004 ).  Furthermore, to the extent that public information  is a key determinant of the development of stock markets, such evidence can shed light on the interaction between public  stock markets and bank markets ( Allen and Gale, 20 0 0.  Levine, 2005 ).   We posit that bank mergers affect borrowers’ incentive to disclose information publicly by affecting the monitoring and  ﬁnancing services provided by banks.  Prior work, however, has not reached consensus on the speciﬁc nature and degree  of the monitoring and ﬁnancing effects of bank mergers, especially for publicly listed borrowers.  Therefore, whether bank  mergers can cause economically meaningful public information spillover through increased disclosure by borrowers is ex  ante unclear and ultimately an empirical question.   On the monitoring side, mergers can change borrowers’ disclosure incentives by changing the nature and extent of bank  monitoring.  Traditional banking literature emphasizes the unique role played by banks because of their ability to produce  soft, private information about their borrowers.  This ability allows banks to serve as delegated monitors for public capital  providers who ﬁnd it diﬃcult to monitor ﬁrms for which much of the information is soft (e. g. , Diamond, 1984, 1991.  Fama,  1985 ).  Following bank mergers, borrowers’ incentive to disclose may increase or decrease depending on how mergers affect  bank monitoring.  On one hand, mergers can alter the nature of bank monitoring from being more soft information based to  being more hard information based, as mergers create more complex and hierarchical organizations that are less effective  at collecting and processing soft information but may be more eﬃcient at processing hard information (e. g. , Stein, 2002.   Berger et al. , 2005 ).  This can lead to increased public disclosure by borrowers for two reasons.  First, merged banks themselves may rely more on hard information that can be eﬃciently collected through public disclosures ( Gormley et al. , 2012 ).   Second, to the extent that banks’ comparative advantage in monitoring primarily emanates from their ability to process soft  information, public capital providers may rely less on bank monitoring after mergers and instead demand additional public  disclosure to facilitate their own monitoring efforts.  On the other hand, to the extent that mergers discipline banks plagued  by agency problems, monitoring effort may increase at banks that did not suﬃciently monitor their borrowers prior to the  mergers.  This may increase the willingness of public capital providers to delegate the monitoring role to banks, reducing  the public capital providers’ demand for public disclosure.   On the ﬁnancing side, borrowers’ disclosure can change if mergers affect their access to bank credit.  Bank mergers are  often motivated by eﬃciency gain considerations, and banks take actions and make changes in their operations to realize  these gains.  While these changes may beneﬁt the merging banks, they are not necessarily welfare improving to all borrowers  ( Karceski et al. , 2005.  Berger et al. , 1999.  DeYoung et al. , 2009 ).  Some borrowers may be adversely affected by these changes  and might experience reduced credit availability.  For example, the merged entity may re-balance and re-optimize their portfolios to achieve better risk management.  When merged banks have signiﬁcant geographic overlap, they may reduce loans  to some existing borrowers to reduce their exposure to the local area ( Amore et al. , 2013 ).  Or, following the disciplinary  acquisition of a poorly run bank, the merged entity may cut lending to borrowers who were beneﬁtting from ineﬃciently  priced cheap loans from the acquired bank.  Reduced credit availability might prompt these borrowers to increase public  disclosure to improve their access to alternative ﬁnancing sources ( Diamond and Verrecchia, 1991.  Baiman and Verrecchia,  1996 ).  At the same time, these changes may also beneﬁt some borrowers whose disclosure may decrease or remain unchanged.  Therefore, whether bank mergers can cause any meaningful public information spillover via the ﬁnancing channel  is also an empirical question.  Our analysis is based on a comprehensive sample of nearly 13,0 0 0 syndicated loan contracts where the lead lenders  are commercial banks or bank holding companies and the borrowers are publicly traded companies in the U. S.  exchanges  with ongoing lending relationships with their banks.  We use a difference-in-differences (DiD) design in which we compare  changes in the disclosure of borrowers whose banks are involved in M&As during their contract periods to contemporaneous  changes in the disclosure of borrowers whose banks are not involved in M&As.   Using the incidence of conference calls as our main measure of disclosure, we ﬁnd that borrowers signiﬁcantly increase  disclosure after their lending banks engage in M&As.  The disclosure increases are not concentrated in periods immediately  after mergers.  instead, they persist throughout post-merger periods.  These effects are robust to the inclusion of controls for  known determinants of disclosure and to alternative measures of disclosure based on earnings forecasts.   In cross-sectional analyses, we ﬁnd that the effects of bank mergers are stronger for borrowers who are more vulnerable  to disruptions in banking services following mergers.  Speciﬁcally, the disclosure increases are larger for borrowers who are  more reliant on the merging banks to ﬁnance their assets and who do not have alternative existing banking relationships.   Consistent with the monitoring channel, we also ﬁnd that disclosure increases are larger when banks perform a stronger  monitoring role (as proxied by the number of covenants in the borrowers’ existing covenants), when information about  borrowers’ operations tends to be soft (as proxied by a composite score based on borrowers’ intangible assets and R&D  expenditure), and when their banks’ pre-merger organizational structures are more suitable for soft-information monitoring  (as proxied by the number of branches operated by the banks).  Finally, consistent with the ﬁnancing channel, we ﬁnd that  the effects of mergers are stronger for borrowers when the merging banks have more correlated geographic exposures and  thus are more likely to cut lending to their existing borrowers for risk diversiﬁcation purposes.   We examine the sensitivity of our results to two alternative explanations.  The ﬁrst one is that changes in local economic  conditions coinciding with bank mergers could be driving our results.  We conduct three analyses to address this concern.   First, we show that our ﬁndings are robust to the inclusion of a comprehensive set of controls for location-level economic  conditions.  Second, we ﬁnd that our results are robust to the inclusion of state-year or MSA-year interactive dummies that  ﬂexibly absorb the effect of any time-varying local-level economic shocks.  Finally, our ﬁndings are also robust to estimating  the DiD speciﬁcation on a propensity score matched sample in which each treatment borrower (affected by bank mergers) is  matched to an economically similar control borrower (unaffected by bank mergers) from the same location.  These ﬁndings  suggest that the disclosure increase is unlikely to be driven by changes in local economic conditions.  A second alternative  explanation is that our results reﬂect the effect of poor ﬁnancial health of banks engaged in mergers.  We note that prior  studies show that bank mergers in the U. S.  have largely been driven by regulatory, technological, and competitive changes,  and most mergers involved healthy ﬁnancial institutions ( Pilloff, 2004 ).  In addition, we ﬁnd that the disclosure increase does  not vary with proxies for bank performance and also manifests when banks are in good health prior to mergers.   We also document two ﬁndings consistent with the premise that bank mergers cause disruptions in borrowers’ banking  service.  First, we ﬁnd that relative to borrowers whose banks did not engage in M&A activities, borrowers of merged banks  reduce their reliance on bank credit and increase their reliance on public bond ﬁnancing following mergers.  Second, we  document signiﬁcant negative stock price reactions to borrowers upon the announcement of their bank mergers.  Collectively,  these ﬁndings are consistent with the interpretation that the disclosure increase reﬂects borrowers’ response to disruptions  in banking services caused by mergers at their existing lending banks.   Our study contributes to the literature on bank mergers.  Merger waves over the last three decades have fundamentally  altered the nature of banks as ﬁnancial intermediaries in the U. S. , and a growing literature seeks to understand the economic consequences of this development.  Our study is the ﬁrst to explore the consequences of this change for the public  information environment in the banking market.  Our results suggest that banking consolidation prompts borrowers to increase transparency to improve access to alternative ﬁnancing sources and to meet the informational demands of capital  providers in a changed monitoring environment in which both public capital providers and banks rely more on public, hard  information for monitoring purposes.  The large number of bank mergers in the U. S.  over the last three decades suggests  that our ﬁndings can shed light on the over-time increases in voluntary disclosure by U. S.  public companies ( Bushee et al. ,  2004 ).  More generally, because the availability of public information affects the ability of stock markets to allocate resources  eﬃciently, our ﬁnding of a spillover effect from bank mergers also improves our understanding of the channels through  which ﬁnancial markets affect resource allocation in the economy, and informs the debate on bank- versus market-based  ﬁnancial systems ( Allen and Gale, 20 0 0 .  Levine, 20 05 ).  While our main focus is on the consequences for the public information environment, our ﬁndings on borrowers’ ﬁnancing changes around mergers add to our understanding of how U. S.   bank mergers affect bank credit supply to publicly listed borrowers.   Our study also contributes to recent research establishing the importance of banking relations on ﬁrms’ public information disclosure behaviors.  Lo (2014) ﬁnds that borrowers increase disclosure following deterioration in their banks’ ﬁnancial  health, consistent with the hypothesis that ﬁrms increase disclosure to facilitate access to public ﬁnancing when continued  access to bank ﬁnancing is under threat.  Vashishtha (2014) ﬁnds that borrowers reduce disclosure after covenant violations.   he concludes that reduced disclosure reﬂects a delegation of monitoring to banks by shareholders who consequently demand less disclosure.  Gormley et al.  (2012) ﬁnd an increase in timely loss recognition after foreign bank entry in India due  to these banks’ greater demand for hard, public information for screening and monitoring borrowers.  Martin and Roychowdhury (2015) ﬁnd evidence of a decrease in timely loss recognition after the initiation of trading in credit default swaps, consistent with a reduction in lenders’ monitoring incentives following this development.  Our study shares with these papers  the common theme that borrowers optimally change disclosure in response to changes in their banking relationships.   The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 develops our hypotheses.  Section 3 describes the data and sample.   Main results are presented and discussed in Section 4 .  Section 5 presents additional analyses and robustness tests, and  Section 6 concludes.   2.  Hypotheses development.  Prior work argues that bank merger waves have signiﬁcantly altered the scope and nature of banks’ operations, as well  as their ability and incentives to monitor and ﬁnance borrowers ( Berger et al. , 1999 ).  We posit that these changes can affect  borrowers’ disclosure incentives in response to changes in borrowers’ monitoring environments (the monitoring channel),  and to changes in banks’ ﬁnancing services to borrowers (the ﬁnancing channel).  In this section, we summarize the relevant  arguments.   2. 1.  The monitoring channel.  Under the monitoring channel, bank mergers can cause borrowers to increase disclosure because the banks’ monitoring  style evolves from being based primarily on soft information to being based more on hard, quantitative information.  The  traditional literature on relationship banking recognizes banks’ role as delegated monitors because of their unique ability to  access and produce soft, private information about their borrowers (e. g. , Diamond, 1984, 1991.  Fama, 1985.  James, 1987 ).   Because dispersed public capital providers rely mainly on hard, public information for monitoring, they ﬁnd it too costly  to monitor and provide capital to ﬁrms for which much of the information is soft.  As a result, for such borrowers, public  capital providers optimally delegate (at least part of) the monitoring effort to banks.  this reduces public capital providers’  own demand for public disclosure for monitoring purposes ( Ball et al. , 20 0 0.  Vashishtha, 2014 ).   Recent work argues that bank mergers could fundamentally change the nature of banks’ monitoring by altering their  organizational structures (e. g. , Stein, 2002.  Berger et al. , 2005 ).  Speciﬁcally, mergers result in larger, more complex, and  more hierarchical banking organizations that are less effective at collecting and processing soft information but may be more  eﬃcient at processing hard information.  Theoretical studies show that complex, hierarchical organizations rely less (more)  on  soft  (hard)  information  because  such  organizations  face  higher  costs  in  motivating  agents  to  produce  and  truthfully  represent soft information, as well as in accurately communicating soft information within organizations.   Several empirical studies provide evidence that banks’ organizational structure affects their relative reliance on soft versus hard information,  and consequently their lending practices.   The shift in the nature of bank monitoring could generate higher demand for public disclosures from capital providers.   The higher demand can come from banks themselves.  To the extent that much of the hard information can be eﬃciently  collected through public disclosures, after M&As, banks may reduce their costly private information collection effort s and  may instead rely more on public disclosures.  Consistent with this possibility, Gormley et al.  (2012) ﬁnd that foreign banks  demand more conservative accounting reports to facilitate their screening and monitoring effort s.  Higher demand may also  come from other external capital providers.  To the extent that banks’ comparative advantage in monitoring emanates primarily from their ability to process soft information, after M&As, public capital providers may rely less on bank monitoring  and instead demand additional public disclosure to facilitate their own monitoring effort s.   On the other hand, mergers could also affect bank monitoring in ways that could lead to a decrease in borrowers’ disclosure.  The literature on the market for corporate control argues that mergers can act as a disciplining device for ﬁrms  plagued by agency problems (e. g. , Shleifer and Vishny, 1997 ).  As a result, monitoring efforts may increase following mergers  at banks that were not suﬃciently monitoring their borrowers prior to the mergers.  This can in turn increase public capital  providers’ incentive to rely more on bank monitoring, reducing their own demand for public disclosure.   2. 2.  The ﬁnancing channel.  Under the ﬁnancing channel, public information spillovers may result if bank mergers adversely affect the availability of  credit to some borrowers who may increase disclosure in their effort to offset the consequences of reduced access to credit.   While mergers are usually motivated by eﬃciency gains, these gains may not be welfare improving for all borrowers.  For  example, in disciplinary mergers that involve the acquisition of poorly run target banks plagued by agency problems, target  banks’ borrowers may be beneﬁtting from below-cost cheap credit prior to mergers.  Following such mergers, efforts by the  new management of the merged entity may reduce or completely eliminate credit to such borrowers.   In general, actions taken by merging banks to realize eﬃciency gains may adversely affect credit availability to some  borrowers even when these borrowers are proﬁtable to banks.  For example, following the increased complexity in organizational structure and associated changes in monitoring style (e. g. , Stein, 2002 ), the merged entity may realize that it  is no longer proﬁtable to lend to borrowers whose credit relevant information tends to be soft ( Berger et al. , 2005 ), such  banks may decide to refocus their lending more on borrowers that can be more cost-effectively monitored based on hard  information and cut lending to borrowers that do not generate reliable hard information.  Mergers can also create adverse  effects on some borrowers because of risk management and portfolio optimization considerations (e. g. , Berger et al. , 1999 ).   For example, following mergers between banks with geographic overlap, the merged entity may cut lending to some existing borrowers to achieve better loan portfolio diversiﬁcation ( Amore et al. , 2013 ).  Finally, anecdotal evidence suggests that  banks may become more selective in lending after mergers, as they gain access to alternative markets and clienteles and  have more proﬁtable business opportunities to pursue than lending to existing borrowers ( Sapsford, 2004 ).   The adverse ﬁnancing effect can prompt banks’ existing borrowers to increase public disclosure for two possible reasons.   First, to the extent that reduction/discontinuation of credit supply by the merged bank is also accompanied by reduced  monitoring effort, the existing shareholders of these borrowers may increase their demand for public disclosure to facilitate  their own monitoring.  Second, borrowers may also increase public disclosure to improve their access to alternative sources  of ﬁnancing to offset the lost bank credit.  Speciﬁcally, ﬁrms with relatively easy access to public ﬁnancing (e. g. , ﬁrms with  above investment grade credit rating or large, ﬁnancially strong ﬁrms) may attempt to offset the loss of bank credit by  accessing public debt markets ( Sapsford and Sherer, 2001 ).  These ﬁrms could increase public disclosure because public disclosure is a more cost-effective way than private communications to resolve information asymmetries and improve their  terms of ﬁnancing with a dispersed set of potential, public capital providers ( Diamond and Verrecchia, 1991.  Baiman and  Verrecchia, 1996) ).  Firms with no easy access to public ﬁnancing (e. g. , those with severe information asymmetries) may resort more to private sources for alternative ﬁnancing.  When this is the case, they may rely more on private communications  to reduce information asymmetries with these investors.  However, to the extent that public disclosure can help attract the  attention of alternative private funding sources in the ﬁrst place, they may also have incentive to increase public disclosure  for this reason.   While mergers may adversely affect some borrowers’ access to bank credit, they may at the same time increase bank  credit availability to other borrowers who might beneﬁt from some of the eﬃciency gains generated from bank mergers.   These borrowers may increase their reliance on bank ﬁnancing, which leads to no change or even a decrease in public  disclosure.  Therefore, the net effect from the ﬁnancing channel can be ambiguous.   Prior research offers no direct evidence on the extent to which mergers alter banks’ monitoring style and effort.  Similarly, while prior studies ( DeYoung et al. , 2009 ) document signiﬁcant improvements in bank performance following mergers  (consistent with the presence of eﬃciency gains), the evidence is inconclusive on what changes banks implement to realize  these gains, and on the extent to which banks pass on the eﬃciency gains to customers.  The evidence is close to nonexistent  for publicly traded borrowers in the U. S. .  For example, while Berger and Udell (1996) and Erel (2011) ﬁnd lower post-merger  loan rates for small and medium businesses in the U. S. , Park and Pennacchi (2009) ﬁnd lower deposit rates in markets with  large banks, suggesting rent extraction from depositors.  Black and Strahan (2002) ﬁnd that the formation of new businesses  increases as the share of small banks decreases, consistent with the idea that banking consolidation improves ﬁnancing for  new businesses.  At the same time, Garmaise and Moskowitz (2006) ﬁnd evidence of decreased credit availability and higher  rates in areas with signiﬁcant bank mergers, and Erel (2011) ﬁnds higher post-merger loan prices when merged banks have  9 The lack of consensus on how mergers change banks’ monitoring and ﬁnancing besigniﬁcant overlap in their markets.   haviors suggests that whether mergers can have a meaningful effect on borrowers’ disclosure on average is ultimately an  empirical question.  That question is the focus of our study.   <Middle> Sample construction and description.  3. 1.  Sample construction.  We draw data from multiple sources to construct our main sample, which spans from 1999 to 2008.   To construct our base sample, we start with ﬁrms in the Compustat database for which data on bank loans are available in the Loan Pricing  Corporation’s (LPC) Dealscan database.  We then identify the lead banks for all loan contracts for these ﬁrms using the lender  information provided in the Dealscan database.  Following prior literature (e. g. , Bharath et al. , 2011 ), we identify a bank as  the lead bank if the Dealscan database indicates that it is the lead arranger.  When the lead arranger credit is missing, we  identify the lead arranger as the lender whose role has been speciﬁed as Admin Agent, Agent, Arranger or Lead Bank in the  database.   Dealscan typically reports as lead arranger the name of the institution listed on the cover page of a loan document.   As a result, regional branches or oﬃces are often listed as the lender of record.  Because these distinctions are often legal  rather than operational, we aggregate these entities into their parent institutions using the Federal Financial Institutions  Examination Council’s National Information Center (NIC) and annual reports as a source of ownership information when  necessary.   We collect information on the merger activities of lead banks using the SNL Financial Bank Mergers and Acquisitions  Database (SNL database).  SNL Financial is a private data vendor that provides comprehensive information on the M&A activities of banking institutions in the U. S. .  We hand-match the lead banks identiﬁed from loan contracts to the SNL database using bank names and geographic information, whenever available.  We verify the accuracy of the match between the Dealscan  loan data and the SNL merger data using information from NIC and press articles available on the internet.  The match results in a total of 892 mergers, staggered over 1995–2008.  Table 1 , Panel A provides the time-series distribution of merger  occurrences and the percentage of loan contracts affected by mergers.  As expected, as the industry consolidates, the number of mergers gradually declines over time.  However, the percentage of loan contracts affected by mergers stays relatively  stable at around 50%, suggesting that approximately half of the observations in our sample are affected by mergers.  The  staggered distribution of bank mergers enables us to apply the DiD design to identify the effect of mergers.   3. 2.  Measuring disclosure.  Our main measure of disclosure is based on the incidence of management conference calls.  Conference calls are a ﬂexible and rich disclosure medium that allows for the release of a wide variety of information through both quantitative and  qualitative disclosures.  Prior research shows that conference calls convey material information to outsiders ( Frankel et al. ,  1999.  Bowen et al. , 2002 ), are persistent/recurring once initiated ( Skinner, 2003 ), and can help reduce pricing ineﬃciency  ( Kimbrough, 2005 ).  In addition, the open nature of conference calls allows sophisticated analysts/investors to directly communicate with and scrutinize managers ( Mayew, 2008.  Mayew et al. , 2013 ), making it diﬃcult for managers to hide bad  news ( Hollander et al. , 2010 ).  Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that the use of conference calls reﬂects a signiﬁcant commitment by ﬁrms to create a transparent information environment.   We obtain data on conference calls from BestCalls. com from 1999 to 2008.  We measure conference call activity using  a dummy variable (CONF_CALL) for the issuance of at least one conference call during a quarter.  Since prior studies ﬁnd  no known issues with the coverage of BestCalls.
