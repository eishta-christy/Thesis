The link between competition and innovation has been a very
active topic in industrial organization.  It goes back to the indirect
debate between Arrow (1962) and Schumpeter (1942) centering
around the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis, which brieﬂy stated
says that one should expect to observe an inverse relationship
between innovation and the intensity of competition or market
structure. 
On the one hand, there are several arguments supporting the
view that possession of market power should result in greater innovative activities (Schumpeter, 1942).  First, market power may be
extendable to new products, for example, through a dominant ﬁrm’s
command over channels of distribution, and so on.  With the ability
to extend market power to new products, an incumbent monopolist should ﬁnd innovation more attractive.  Second, there may be a
need to ﬁnance innovation internally, which puts ﬁrms with market power at an advantage since these ﬁrms may have supernormal
proﬁts.  Third, ﬁrms with current market power typically have more
resources and thus are more likely to hire the most innovative people.  Of course the third argument is related to the imperfect capital
market argument underlying the second reason. 
On the other hand, there are arguments for the opposite view,
supporting the view that a monopolist can have reduced incentives to innovate.  Arrow (1962) shows that a competitor can proﬁt
more than a monopolist from innovation, and the monopolist may
be slower in replacing it with a superior product or process than a
newcomer.  This is because the ﬁrm realising monopoly proﬁts on its
current product calculates the proﬁt from innovation as the difference between its current proﬁts and the proﬁts it could realise from
the new product, whereas the competitor regards the proﬁts from
the new product as the gain.  As such, the larger current monopoly
proﬁts are, the less incentive the monopolist has to innovate.  Moreover, a monopolist may regard additional leisure as superior to
additional proﬁts.  This may be due to the lack of active competitive
forces and thus generates an x-ineﬃciency effect. 
The lively debate on the relationship between competition and
innovation in the industrial organization literature is still open and
systematically predicts a monotone relationship in either direction
between competition and innovation. 1 In clear contrast, Aghion Name
(2005) provide evidence of an inverted-U relationship between innovation and competition.  Their theoretical explanation is based on a
neo-Schumpeterian endogenous growth model (Aghion Name, 1997),
in which both technological leaders and followers in any industry can innovate, and innovations occur as a step-by-step process. 2
Innovation incentives depend upon the difference between postinnovation and pre-innovation rents of incumbent ﬁrms.  In this case,
more competition may foster innovation and growth, because it may
reduce a ﬁrm’s pre-innovation rents by more than it reduces its
post-innovation rents. 
One aspect that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been considered is the relationship between competition and innovation in a
polluting (or energy intensive) industry where R&D investment aims
to reduce the environmental footprint of production.  This is the purpose of the present paper.  In particular, we bring together the debate
on the relationship between competition and innovation with the
environmental economics debate on the optimal policy for pollution
control, concentrating on one policy instrument, an emission tax. 
Currently the main three major inﬂuences on ﬁrms’ R&D investment
are a focus on cleaner technologies, demand for renewable or sustainable energy and climate change,3 and they are further fuelled by
environmental regulation and international agreements on climate
change and the like. 4 In this context, “green” R&D can be seen as
a tool that ﬁrms can use to improve the cost imposed on them by
environmental regulation. 
We verify the presence of an inverted-U relationship between
competition and innovation in a microeconomic setting of oligopolistic competition where production is polluting and innovation results
in reducing emissions (abatement or, “green” R&D).  Given the presence of Pigouvian (emission) taxation, reducing pollution would
reduce production costs. 5 We present an n-ﬁrm oligopoly model
where ﬁrms compete in quantities and decide their investment in
“green” R&D, and where spillovers in R&D are present.  We establish
the link between competition and “green” innovation through the
variation of aggregate investment in R&D according to the number
of ﬁrms in the industry.  a greater number of ﬁrms in the industry
proxies increased competition and a concomitant reduction in market power (Sutton, 1998). 6 We show that the relationship between
competition and “green” R&D is represented by an inverted-U and
that this result is driven mainly by the presence of R&D spillovers
(appropriability problem).  The results obtained by Aghion Name
(2005) are thus conﬁrmed in a microeconomic framework where
innovation has the aim of abating polluting emissions. 
The paper is also related to the literature on organisational structure of environmental R&D (e. g. , Scott, 1996.  Chiou and Hu, 2001. 
Petrakis and Poyago-Theotoky, 2002.  Sandonís and Mariel, 2004. 
Poyago-Theotoky, 2007.  Golombek and Hoel, 2008).  With this literature, we share the assumption of R&D efforts being directed
not towards process or product enhancement, but directed towards
emission reduction of harmful pollutants.  The analysis in the paper
is close to Poyago-Theotoky (2007), who examines the issue of R&D
cooperation versus competition in a polluting industry where two
ﬁrms operate and endogenous taxation is set by a time-consistent
regulator.  Compared to Poyago-Theotoky (2007), we set aside the
R&D cooperation issue.  instead we consider an oligopoly rather
than a duopoly, and we focus on the case in which the regulator is
able to commit credibly to the setting of the environmental policy
instrument.  Finally, we assume that abatement is of the end-of-pipe
variant. 
Finally, the paper is related to the literature of innovation and
market structure.  Hausman and MacKie-Mason (1988) argued that
the actions of monopolies with regard to third-degree price discrimination, may lead to social welfare improvement due to opening
new markets, achieving economies of scale and higher eﬃciency and,
importantly, increasing net social welfare.  Geroski (1990) shows that
innovating may be a way to obtain market power, in particular he
ﬁnds that innovation increases the degree of competition in markets. 
This leads to a fall in market concentration over time and eventually
to the emergence of very few and large ﬁrms.  Therefore ﬁrms innovate with the aim to become incumbents.  Etro (2004) shows that
the innovative process is naturally connected to the persistence of
monopolies.  Their investment in research and development would
be beneﬁcial to society as they advance new technologies.  Our paper
contributes to this strand by focussing on innovation with “green”
features. 
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.  In Section 2
we present the model, in Section 3 we carry out the analysis and
establish the results and in Section 4 we provide concluding remarks. 
Proofs of propositions are in the Appendix. 
<Middle> The model. 
Consider an oligopoly market with n identical proﬁt-maximising
ﬁrms competing à la Cournot-Nash.  Firms supply a homogeneous
good, with market demand given by p = a − Q.  a is a positive constant parameter measuring the reservation price (alternatively, it is ameasure of the size of the market) and Q =
i=1 qi is total industry
output, i = 1, .  .  .  , n.  Production generates pollution, which is taxed
at the emission tax rate t, while ﬁrm i can reduce its tax burden
by undertaking environmental (“green”) R&D, zi, to reduce its emissions.  The cost function for ﬁrm i is additive separable and is given
by c (qi, zi) = cqi + cz2
i /2, where c is the unit cost of production,
a > c, andc > 0 is a parameter capturing the eﬃciency of the R&D
R&D, z(t) =t /c.  Evidently, ﬁrms respond to an increase in the
emission tax by increasing their “green” R&D.  Notice also that the
emission tax acts as an incentive for ﬁrms undertaking abatement, as
in the absence of emission taxation there would be no “green” R&D. 
Aggregate R&D is therefore. 
Clearly, total R&D increases monotonically with the number of
ﬁrms for a ﬁxed emission tax.  Hence, if taxation were exogenous, we
obtain a clear-cut Arrowian result.  Increased competition (higher n)
leads to an increase in aggregate R&D (innovation). 
In the ﬁrst stage, the regulator sets the emission tax so as to maximise social welfare, deﬁned as total surplus minus production costs,
R&D costs and environmental damages. 
Substituting the ﬁrm’s output q(t) and R&D effort, z(t) into the above
expression we obtain total welfare as a function of the emission tax. 
From the ﬁrst-order condition of Eq.  (4) we obtain the optimal
emission tax 
where b ∈ [0, 1] represents R&D spillovers, i. e.  there are spillovers
in environmental R&D in that a ﬁrm beneﬁts not only from its own
R&D effort but also from its rivals’ effort by an amount b. 9 We denote
aggregate R&D as Z =
i=1 zi and the total R&D expenditure as
cZ2/2.  Hence, ﬁrm i(cid. 5)s proﬁt is pi = pqi − c (qi, zi) − tei (qi, zi) , with
emission taxation a linear function of net emissions.  Total emissionsi=1 ei (qi, zi), and the damage function is a quadratic function of emissions, D = dE2, where d is a parameter capturing the
steepness of marginal damages or, the degree of convexity of the
damage function.  To guarantee interior solutions in what follows we
assume d > (1/2n) (see also, Petrakis and Xepapadeas (2001) and
Poyago-Theotoky (2007)).  This implies that environmental damages
are not insigniﬁcant for the economy. 
In the sequel we consider the case where the regulator precommits to the level of environmental policy, i. e. , the emission tax.  In
particular, we examine a three-stage game where.  in stage one, the
regulator sets the emission tax so as to maximise social welfare,
in stage two, ﬁrms invest in “green” R&D and in stage three market competition occurs. 10 The equilibrium solution concept is perfect
subgame equilibrium with backward induction. 
3.  Analysis and results. 
3. 1.  Derivation of equilibrium. 
In the last stage, the market competition stage, ﬁrm i chooses
output to maximise proﬁts
where t is the tax per unit of emissions and q−i =
j(cid. 3)=iqj is the
total output of its rivals, taken by ﬁrm i as given.  From the ﬁrstorder condition, a − 2qi − q−i − c − t = 0, and by symmetry (i. e. 
q1 = q2 = . . .  = qn ≡ q) we obtain per-ﬁrm equilibrium output. 
where, for notational simplicity we set m = a − c, and m measures
market size.  Notice that the equilibrium output does not depend on
abatement directly, but it is affected by it through taxation.  with output decreasing in the emission tax and the number of ﬁrms, ceteris
paribus.  The associated proﬁt is then this. 
In the second stage, ﬁrm i chooses “green” R&D (abatement effort) to
maximize proﬁts (Eq.  (2)), taking as given its rivals’ aggregate abatement effort.  From the relevant ﬁrst-order condition, t − czi = 0, and
by symmetry (z1 = z2 = .  .  .  = zn ≡ z) we obtain the equilibrium
by substituting Eqs.  (5), (6) and (7), into Eqs.  (2) and (3). 
3. 2.  Comparative statics. 
In this section, we examine how the equilibrium values react
to changes in the parameters.  n (intensity of competition), c
(eﬃciency/diﬃculty of innovation), b (degree of spillovers) and d
(severity of environmental damage). 
We proceed by summarising our ﬁndings in the following propositions (proofs are relegated in the Appendix). 
Proposition 1 (EFFECT OF d).  The optimal emission tax t
in the severity of environmental damage d. 
∗ is increasing
That the emission tax is increasing in the severity of environmental damages is entirely expected.  Indeed the emission tax is the only
policy tool to address a number of market failures.  the environmental externality distortion, the output market distortion associated
with imperfect competition, the innovation/abatement distortion
and the appropriability problem (knowledge-public good distortion)
associated with the R&D spillover.  Thus the higher the damages
the higher the emission tax, ceteris paribus, as it is addressing the
environmental externality. 
Proposition 2 (EFFECT OF n).  The effect of the number of ﬁrms n on the
optimal emission tax t is described as follows,
there exists a threshold value for n, ˆn2,
I For d > max
such that the emission tax is increasing (decreasing) as n ≶ ˆn2,
II For d ∈
(cid. 16)
there exists a threshold value for n,
ˆn3, such that the emission tax is increasing (decreasing) as n ≶ ˆn3,
there exists a threshold value for n,
ˆn4, such that the emission tax is increasing (decreasing) as n ≶ ˆn4. 
The threshold values ˆni (dni) are given by the solution to 1/(
, the emission tax is decreasing in n. 
Proposition 2, illustrated in Fig.  1, provides a full characterisation
of the effect of the number of ﬁrms on the emission tax. 12 Parts I,
II and III identify a ‘small/large’ number oligopoly effect in relation
to the extent of damages.  when n < ˆni (‘small’-numbers oligopoly),
the emission tax is increasing in n so as to bring about more abatement but also to address the output market distortion while for
n > ˆni (‘large’-numbers oligopoly) the emission tax is decreasing in n
as competition becomes more intense, partly easing the output and
innovation distortions so that a lower emission tax can be justiﬁed.  In
part IV, the emission tax is decreasing due to damages being insignificant (small d), as with more ﬁrms conducting R&D there is less need
for incentivising abatement. 
Proposition 3 (EFFECT OF c ).  The optimal emission tax t
(i) increasing in R&D eﬃciency, c, for d ≥ d+(0,(cid. 21)c), and decreasing in c when c ≥(cid. 21)c
(ii) for d ∈1, the emission tax is increasing in c when c ∈1 +b (n(n + 1) − 2) +c =
(cid. 22)
4n + 5 + 2b [n(3n + 1) − 4] + b2 [n(n + 1) − 2]
4n [1 + b (n − 1)]c > 1/(2n) > 0 , and
(cid. 21)c = − 2dn (n + 1) [1 +b (n − 1)](1 + b (n − 1)) (2dn − 1) +(cid. 5)XWhen environmental damage d is relatively large, R&D is more
important in reducing emissions, so to incentivise ﬁrms to engage in
emission reduction the emission tax is increasing (part (i)).  For small
damages, the emission tax is increasing for relatively easy R&D, but
decreasing when R&D is more diﬃcult, still providing incentives for
abatement (part (ii)). 
Proposition 4 (EFFECT OF b ).  The effect of the spillover, b, on the
optimal emission tax t
∗ is described as follows. (n)/∂b ≤ 0,
S1 For d ≥ max{db0, 1/(2n)} the emission tax is decreasing in the
S2 For d ∈ (max{db1, 1/(2n)}, db0), ∂t
∗(n)/∂b (cid. 3) 0 for all b (cid. 4) b+
S3 For d ∈ (1/(2n), db1), the emission tax is increasing in the
spillover, b, ∂t
with b+ ∈ (0, 1],spillover, b, ∂t
(n)/∂b > 0,
(Proposition 2) and captures the effect of the emission tax.  The effect
on aggregate innovation can be decomposed into a positive direct
effect (ﬁrst term in brackets) and a non-monotonic indirect effect
(second term in brackets) which is further re-enforced by n. 
In a similar manner we obtain,
Therefore the non-monotonicity in the variation of t with respect
to c (from Proposition 3) explains these variations of equilibrium
innovation and output.  Next we observe that.  Proposition 4 is illustrated in Fig.  2, drawn in the space (c, d).  Its
properties are invariant in n. 
Proposition 4 provides a complete characterisation of the effect
of the spillover on the emission tax.  In area S1 a higher spillover is
associated with a reduction in the emission tax as the appropriability
problem is exacerbated and hence points to a lower tax and a lower
incentive to innovate.  In area S3, the opposite occurs which appears
counter-intuitive.  however, in this area R&D is more diﬃcult (higher
c) and damages are small (low d) so than an increase in the emission tax is needed to provide the necessary incentive for abatement. 
Area S2 is intermediate between areas S1 and S3 where the direction
of the change in the emission tax depends on the magnitude of the
spillover. 
Regarding the comparative statics of individual ﬁrm innovation,
ﬁrm output, and aggregate innovation notice that these can be
expressed as functions of the emission tax. 
It is evident that the behaviour of individual innovation is determined by the effect of n on the tax and therefore is non-monotonic
(from Proposition 2).  The effect on individual output is also comprised of two effects, a negative direct effect (ﬁrst term), which
is the standard result arising from increased competition, and an
indirect effect (second term) which can be negative or positive,
where from Proposition 4 and the non-monotonicity in the variations
of t, we can put in evidence the well known effects of the appropriability problem of knowledge (in particular, Proposition 4, partFinally, we consider the comparative statics properties of individual emissions. 
Proposition 5.  Individual equilibrium emissions are. 
(i) decreasing in the number of ﬁrms,
(ii) decreasing in spillovers,
(iii) increasing in R&D eﬃciency,
(iv) decreasing in the severity of environmental damage. 
Parts (ii) and (iv) are a direct consequence of the effects identiﬁed
in Proposition 4 (S1 and S2) and Proposition 1 above.  Parts (i) and
(iii) are more complex as they combine the non-monotonic effect of
the changes in the emission tax and the direct and indirect effects
associated with changes in R&D and output.  It appears that in part
(i) the output direct effect is dominating while in part (iii) the R&D
direct effect dominates. 
3. 3.  Competition and “green” innovation
We now turn to the main research question, i. e. , the relationship
between competition and “green” innovation.  Recall that we proxy
the intensity of competition by the number of ﬁrms in the market,
n.  In order to highlight the role played by R&D spillovers, we consider ﬁrst the case where they are absent, i. e. , b = 0.  In this instance
aggregate R&D is,
showing a positive relationship between innovation and n, that is, a
clear-cut Arrowian result.  We thus state. 
Lemma 1.  In the absence of R&D spillovers there is a positive relationship between competition and “green” innovation. 13
Next we consider the case where R&D spillovers are present, b ∈
(0, 1].  To obtain fully analytical results, we evaluate the shape of the
aggregate R&D function.  The main result of the paper is given in the
next Proposition. 
Proposition 6 (COMPETITION AND “GREEN” INNOVATION). given d in the presence of positive R&D spillovers, b ∈ (0, 1], the aggre(n) is concave and single peaked.  A suﬃcient
gate “green” innovation Z
condition for its maximum to occur at n ≥ 2 is b ∈ (0, min{(1+c)/5, 1}]. Proposition 6, together with Lemma 1, points out that the
inverted-U relationship is driven by the presence of spillovers.
