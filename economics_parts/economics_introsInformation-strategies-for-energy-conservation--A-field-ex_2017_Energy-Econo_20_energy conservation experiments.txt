Strategies that provide information about the environmental impact
of activities are increasingly seen as an effective way to encourage conservation behavior (Evans Name, 2009).  The environmental impact of
everyday activities is often invisible to consumers who cannot gauge
the impact of their actions.  Information strategies that aim to correct
this information asymmetry are increasingly common (Foulon Name,
2002.  Kennedy Name, 1994).  These include mercury and air pollution
advisories (Cutter and Neidell, 2009.  Shimshack and Ward, 2010. 
Shimshack Name, 2007.  Zivin and Neidell, 2009).  mandatory and
voluntary corporate disclosure (Bennear and Olmstead, 2008.  Delmas
Name, 2010.  Evans Name, 2009.  Khanna, 2001.  Konar and Cohen, 1997. 
Lyon and Maxwell, 2007.  Powers Name, 2011) and ecolabels (Hallstein
and Villas-Boas, 2013.  Teisl Name, 2002).  Such strategies are based on
the principle that more and better information about the environmental
impact of activities will encourage consumers to conserve. 
Electricity conservation has been an especially active context
for the deployment of information strategies.  Electricity and heat generation accounts for over 40% of greenhouse gases across the world
(International Energy Agency, 2014) and effective conservation programs could contribute to signiÔ¨Åcant environmental improvements.  A
large number of energy conservation experiments have been conducted using various information strategies to reduce energy use
