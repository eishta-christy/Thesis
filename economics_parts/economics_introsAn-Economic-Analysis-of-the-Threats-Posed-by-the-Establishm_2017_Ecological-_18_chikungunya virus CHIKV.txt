 1.  Introduction Aedes albopictus is the most invasive mosquito in the world (Medlock et al. , 2012).  It is an aggressive biter, active all-day long (Caglioti et al. , 2013) and feeds on humans and a variety of other vertebrate hosts.  It is relatively long lived and lays its desiccation resistant eggs in natural and artiﬁcial containers (Charrel et al. , 2007.  Pardigon, 2009).  Originally of Asian origin, it is now widely distributed across Europe, Africa, the Americas and the Paciﬁc (Tsetsarkin et al. , 2007).  It has recently colonized the islands of the Torres Strait (Ritchie et al. , 2006) where a limited control program costs over AU$1 M per annum (Muzari, 2015).  Ae.  albopictus is a vector of more than 20 arboviruses, is recognised as a secondary vector of dengue (Bonizzoni et al. , 2014.  Gratz, 2004.  Lambrechts et al. , 2010) and is the major vector of many recent chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreaks including the La Reunion epidemic (200,000 cases and 203 deaths.  Renault et al.
