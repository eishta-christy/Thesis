 1.  Introduction Studies have shown that gold extraction and processing can signiﬁcantly degrade natural environments (including soil and sediments, water, and air quality) and, with that, human health and livelihoods (Hilson, 2000.  Akpalu and Parks, 2007.  Obiri, 2007.  Leder et al. , 2012.  Saldarriaga-Isaza et al. , 2013.  Ako et al. , 2014.  Ansa-Asare et al. , 2015).  The pollution mainly occurs during gold extraction and processing, which includes carbon-in-leach, heap leaching with cyanide, biological oxidation and roasting (Hilson, 2002.  Leder et al. , 2012).  However, the existing laws in developing countries fail to effectively regulate the gold mining industries leading to excessive environmental degradation (Hilson, 2000).  Thus, in gold-rich countries in Africa, gold miners, both large- and small-scale, routinely discharge toxic chemicals such as mercury (typically used by small scale miners), cyanide and arsenic and their harmful compounds into water bodies, exposing workers and residents to a range of health risks including lower respiratory tract infections, cardiovascular diseases (Franchini and Mannucci, 2007, 2009, and Franchini and Mannucci, 2012.  Mergler et al. , 2007.  Banchirigah, 2008.  Obiri et al. , 2010), skin infections, and cancerous infections (Amegbey and Adimado, 2003.  Adei et al. , 2011.  Obiri et al. , 2010). 1 A recent review of arsenic concentration in surface and underground water, for example, found mining as a major cause of high concentration of the hazardous substance in several African countries (Ahoulé et al. , 2015).  Some of the environmental and human damage can be irreversible (see e. g. , Naicker et al. , 2003.  Stephens and Ahern, 2001).  In Ghana, for example, several studies have documented heaped waste materials at mining sites, which have resulted in the release of toxic chemicals into the environment (see e. g. , Akabzaa et al. , 2005.  Essumang et al. , 2007.  Yidana et al. , 2007.  and Armah et al. , 2010).  The Council on Ethics of the Norwegian ‘Government Pension Fund Global’ carried out a detailed survey on mining pollution at the oldest gold mining town (Obuasi) and found evidence of severe environmental and health damage due to high level of concentration of arsenic, cyanide and heavy metals (e. g.  cadmium, manganese, lead and copper) in water bodies (Leder et al. , 2012).  An earlier study also cited eight cases of cyanide spillage within a decade and a half (Amegbey and Adimado, 2003), which prompted the Ghana's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to remark that the nation is likely to experience water stress in less than a decade (Banchirigah, 2008).  In addition to water pollution, the use of heavy machinery in extracting the ore, coupled with the surface mining techniques commonly employed by miners in developing countries, generates substantial dust which can cause or exacerbate respiratory disorders (Ayine, 2001.  ILO, 2005.
