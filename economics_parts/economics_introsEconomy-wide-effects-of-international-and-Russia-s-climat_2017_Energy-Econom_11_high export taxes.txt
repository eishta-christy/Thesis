 1.  Introduction At the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, the parties agreed on an ambitious target to limit the increase in global mean temperature to 1. 5–2. 0 °C.  Among other countries, Russia proposed a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and has submitted a pledge to the United Nations (UN), which proposes a 25–30% reduction in Russia's GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 (Carbon Brief, 2015).  At present, Russia is one of the world's largest producers of GHG emissions.  Russia's share of global GHG emissions accounted for approximately 5% in 2012 (WRI, 2012).  In 2014, Russia's GHG emissions without land use, land-use change and forestry were nearly 30% below the 1990 level (UNFCCC, 2016).  This implies that Russia would need a stricter climate policy to prevent any increase in It is likely that Russia might not need any “standard” climate policy instrument, such as a carbon tax or an emission trading system, to achieve a substantial reduction in GHG emissions.  This is because, similar to many other economies, the Russian economy is distorted by preexisting subsidies imposed on domestic energy consumption.  For example, Russia imposes high export taxes on crude oil, oil products, and natural gas (Roskazna, 2015).  Furthermore, domestic gas prices are regulated in Russia, and they remain substantially lower than export netback prices (Gazprom, 2015).
