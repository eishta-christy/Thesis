 1.  Introduction  This paper examines whether and when the information environment of peer ﬁrms in  an industry affects the cost of capital for other ﬁrms in the industry.  We predict and ﬁnd  that the peer information environment is negatively associated with a ﬁrm’s cost of capital  when there is less publicly available ﬁrm-speciﬁc information and this negative association  shrinks as the amount of ﬁrm-speciﬁc information increases.  This paper provides evidence  that information about peer-ﬁrms has externalities on the cost of capital for related ﬁrms  and that these externalities are time-varying.   We examine whether the information environment of peer ﬁrms (henceforth, peer information) affects the cost of capital  for related ﬁrms in an industry and whether the importance of this effect depends on the amount of information available  directly from the related ﬁrm (henceforth, ﬁrm information).  Speciﬁcally, we hypothesize that peer information has a larger  economic effect on a ﬁrm’s cost of capital when ﬁrm information is scarce, and that these externalities reduce when the  amount of ﬁrm information increases and substitutes for peer information.  Recent research ﬁnds evidence that a ﬁrm’s disclosure has important economic consequences for its peers.  For example, a ﬁrm’s disclosure inﬂuences peer ﬁrms’ (i)  stock prices, (ii) stock liquidity, and (iii) investment decisions (e.
