 1.  Introduction Vehicles are a major source of pollution in most countries.  In Canada, for instance, light duty vehicles generated 82 million tonnes of greenhouse gases, approximately 12% of the country’s total emissions (Canada, 2015).  Vehicles also produce other pollutants that adversely affect human health and well-being.  These including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter among others.  Pollution from cars and trucks is often viewed as the archetypal economic externality.  the costs associated with emissions accrue to society but are not fully borne privately by drivers.  Reducing transportation-related gasoline consumption has, unsurprisingly, become a focus of policy makers.  An expanding array of policies have targeted vehicular emissions in Canada (Antweiler and Gulati, 2013).  Several provinces have offered rebates for the purchase of fuel eﬃcient vehicles such as hybrid-electric or electric vehicles (Chandra, 2010).  Ontario and the federal government used a system of taxes and rebates based on fuel economy (Rivers et al. , 2017.  Sallee and Slemrod, 2012).  British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec apply a carbon price as a disincentive on the consumption of fossil fuels (Antweiler and Gulati, 2016.  Rivers et al. , 2015), and similar carbon prices are required across all provinces by 2018 under the Pan-Canadian Framework on Green Growth and Climate Change.  The federal government has provided a tax credit to encourage commuting by public transport rather than private vehicle (Rivers and Plumptre, 2016.  Chandler, 2014) and recently adopted new vehicle greenhouse gas intensity regulations requiring manufacturers to achieve speciﬁc targets for ﬂeet-wide emissions per kilometre. 1 The optimal stringency of each of these programs depends, at least to some degree, on the responsiveness of the fuel economy of vehicles to the price of gasoline.  Policy makers therefore require reliable estimates of key elasticities relating to the choice of and use of the vehicle stock in response to gasoline prices and other policies.  Yet, despite the breadth of attempts to address externalities from automobile usage, little is known about how gasoline prices actually inﬂuence consumer decision-making with respect to new vehicle fuel economy.  We estimate the elasticity of new vehicle fuel eﬃciency with respect to gasoline price by exploiting a rich dataset covering gasoline prices, vehicle registrations, vehicle fuel economy, and demographic variables at the neighborhood level in 42 Canadian cities from 2000 to 2010.  Our data and econometric models enable us to credibly control for unobserved time-varying and cross-sectional variables that may otherwise bias estimates of the elasticity.
