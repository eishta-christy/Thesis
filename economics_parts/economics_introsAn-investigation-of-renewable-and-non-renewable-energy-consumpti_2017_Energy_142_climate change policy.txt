 1.  Introduction The study of the economic growth and energy consumption nexus allows for testing of four hypotheses with strong implications for growth and energy policy.  (1) the feedback hypothesis (which indicates a bidirectional causation between the two variables).  (2) the growth hypothesis (or a unidirectional causation ﬂowing from energy to economic growth).  (3) the conservative hypothesis (or a unidirectional causation ﬂowing from economic growth to energy).  or (4) the neutrality hypothesis (no causation).  Hypothesis (2) advances the view that energy consumption promotes economic growth.  It is also widely believed that demand for energy is propelled by economic growth, giving rise to hypothesis (3).  The complementarity between energy and economic growth, as portrayed in (2) and (3), has given rise to hypothesis (1).  Hypotheses (1) and (2) posit a connection between energy policy and economic growth.  Acceptance of these hypotheses discourages restrictive energy policies, but calls for policies that promote energy efﬁciency.  The prevalence of hypotheses (3) or (4) emphasises a disconnection between energy policies and economic growth and gives a green light to energy conservation policies (Narayan, 2016). 1 While a plethora of studies examine this nexus for total energy consumption, there is an emerging strand that examines the four hypotheses explicitly for total renewables and/or non-renewables for one or more individual countries, or a panel of countries, by their level of economic development or region (see, Tiba et al. , 2016.  Bhattacharya et al. , 2016.  Chang et al. , 2015.  Salim et al. , 2014.  Pao et al. , 2014.  Marques and Fuinhas, 2012.  Apergis and Payne, 2011a, 2011b, 2010a.  Apergis et al. , 2010.  and Sardosky, 2009).  Some also examine the traditional energy consumption and economic growth nexus for different energy mixes of renewables and non-renewables (see Bloch et al. , 2015.  Long et al. , 2015.  Pao and Fu, 2013.  Marques and Fuinhas, 2012.  and Yildirim et al. , 2012).  We summarise these studies in Table 1.  By mainly using cointegration/VECM/VAR/Granger causality tests for developing and developed nations, this group of studies clariﬁes policy directions along the lines of long-term growth and energy by renewable and non-renewable energy.  While this literature shows evidence that is mixed, for both renewables and non-renewables, majority tend to ﬁnd support for the feedback hypothesis (see Table 1).  Of the 28 previous studies surveyed, for renewables, the majority (57%) show evidence in support of the feedback effect in the long run (Apergis and Payne 2010a,b, 2011a,b, 2012.  Apergis et al. , 2010.  Apergis and Danuletiu, 2014.  Chang et al. , 2015.  Salim et al.  2014.  Tiba et al. , 2016.  Tugcu et al. , 2012.  Pao and Fu, 2013.  Lin and Moubarak, 2014.  Sebri and Ben-Salha, 2014.  Bloch et al. , 2015.  Omri et al. , 2015).  Only nine out of 28 studies consider short-term causality and all nine show evidence in favour of the feedback effect in the short-run (Sardosky, 2009.  Apergis and Payne 2010a,b, 2011a,b, 2012.  Pao et al. , 2014.  Sebri and Ben-Salha, 2014.  and Shahbaz et al. , 2015).  Evidence that renewable energy leads economic growth is found in 18% of the studies in the longrun (Pao et al. , 2014.  Bhattacharya et al. , 2016.  Yildirim et al. , 2012.  Chang et al. , 2015.  Shahbaz et al. , 2015.  Omri et al. , 2015).  Evidence that economic growth causes higher demand for renewable energy is found in 18% of the studies (Sardosky, 2009.  Menyah and Wolde-Rufael, 2010.  Long et al. , 2015.  Omri et al. , 2015.  and Mbarek et al. , 2017).  Neutrality between renewable energy consumption and economic growth is supported in 11% of the studies (Marques and Fuinhas, 2012.  Pao and Fu, 2015.  Chang et al. , 2015).  Of the 12 studies that examine the link between non-renewable energy consumption and economic growth, majority (67%) show the same feedback effect in the long run (Apergis and Payne, 2011a.  Pao et al. , 2014.  Salim et al.  2014.  Pao and Fu, 2013, 2015.  Shahbaz et al. , 2015.  Bloch et al. , 2015.  Long et al. , 2015).  The evidence of the growth hypothesis is prevalent in 25% of the studies (Tugcu et al. , 2012.  Bhattacharya et al. , 2016) in the long run and one study, Pao et al. , 2014, in the short run.  Evidence of the conservative hypothesis is not found, but the neutrality hypothesis is found in Tugcu et al.  (2012).  In this study, we re-examine the four hypotheses outlined above for renewable and non-renewable energy consumption per capita. 2 The point of difference between this study and the extant literature is that we distinguish between residential and industrial users of renewable and non-renewable energy.  This distinction recognises the varying energy source mix which we explain below.  We ﬁnd that the disparity in the energy type mix between the two user groups becomes more apparent when we classify the users of energy by their level of development.  It can therefore be argued that the link between energy and economic growth will depend on the level of development, the users, and the energy mix.  The four hypotheses are tested for countries categorised into four income groups.  high income (HI), upper middle income (UMI), and low and lower middle income (LLMI).  Several of the abovementioned panel-based studies examine the four hypotheses on the basis of the level of development of the country, although most of these studies only examine a developed country panel (Apergis and Payne 2010a.  Salim, et al. , 2014.  and Chang et al. , 2015) or developed and developing panels (see Apergis and Payne 2011a.  Apergis et al.  2010.  Omri et al. , 2015).  Tiba et al.  (2016) is the only study that examines the energygrowth nexus for two out of four income groups (see Table 3 below) normally used to classify countries, i. e.  high income and middle income countries.  Such a division is important as across these income groups the nature of changes occurring with respect to the use of renewables and non-renewables, is signiﬁcantly different.  The International Energy Agency (IEA, 2006.  2015) notes that in the United States and the European Union, expansion of renewable energy occurs largely at the expense of aging fossil-fuelled capacity.  In China, India, and many other developing countries, expansion of renewable capacity goes hand-in-hand with efforts to expand energy supply from other sources, to keep up with rapidly increasing demand.  So far, only one study has shed some light on the association between economic growth and renewable and non-renewable industrial energy consumption (see Doytch and Narayan, 2016). 3 Doytch and Narayan (2016) examine the one-way link going from economic growth to total industrial energy consumption for high, middle and low and lower middle income groups – in effect only testing the conservative hypothesis.  Their GMM estimations, which also factor in for sectoral FDI, suggest that real GDP per capita growth positively and signiﬁcantly inﬂuences industrial energy consumption (renewable and non-renewable).  Our study follows the same testing procedure, but focuses on the bilateral relationship for this category of energy consumption (industrial) as well as residential renewables and non-renewables.  In doing so, our study is one of the few to explore the short-term association between renewable (and non-renewable) energy consumption and economic growth.  The link between industrial energy consumption and economic growth is one that can be contemplated without much difﬁculty using the growth theory.  For instance, industrial energy use by both labour and capital produces goods and services.  However, the theoretical underpinning for the relationship between residential energy consumption and economic growth is unknown.  Empirical evidence on hypotheses (1) to (4) for total residential (and industrial) energy consumption is also rather thin. 4 Nonetheless residential energy users are seen by policymakers as key target groups for energy conservation policies.  “Residential energy conservation is a key component of contemporary energy and climate change policy in the US and elsewhere” (Suter and Shammin, 2013.  551).
