 1.  Introduction Oil ranks among the most volatile non-agricultural commodities in the world and this volatility has increased in recent years due mainly to the recent global ﬁnancial crises, the surge in production of shale oil and the change in OPEC's policy from the quota mechanism to the market share maximization.  Oil prices dropped from $147/barrel in July 2008 to $32/barrel in March 2009 due particularly to the global ﬁnancial crisis of 2008–2009 and then climbed to more than $100/barrel in the ﬁrst quarter of 2011, rising in-line with the global economic recovery.  They dropped again in 2015 to under $50/barrel, where they have stayed, as a result of Saudi Arabia's decision seeking a greater market share as well as the increases in shale oil production.  In January 2016, the U. S.  oil prices plunged below $27/barrel for the ﬁrst time since 2003 due to a rise in global oil inventories, concurrently with traders also worried that the crude supply glut could linger.  Therefore, the oil volatility shocks are a major source of instability for the world economy, and they particularly impact the future economic health of oil-exporting countries that depend on oil exports for most of their revenues.  Under these circumstances, these countries have had to dip into their foreign reserves and thereby have seen their credit ratings drop signiﬁcantly, while the premiums on their credit default swaps (CDS) have soared because these credit derivatives generally measure the expected credit risk, fear, default, greed and future economic performance of countries (Hammoudeh et al. , 2013a, 2013b.  Hammoudeh and Sari, 2011).  A CDS contract is the most common type of credit derivatives that offers protection against adverse credit events.  The market price of a CDS (called a CDS premium or a spread) reﬂects the risk of the underlying credit asset.  A CDS index is a highly liquid, standardized credit security that trades at a very small bid-ask spread.  CDSs can thus be efﬁcient in processing information on evolving risks in the economies.  For a sovereign CDS, a credit event is equivalent to a debt-issuing country defaulting on its debt payment commitments (Broto and Pérez-Quirós, 2015).  The magnitude of the credit spreads gauges the degree of the default risk exposure of the country, where a widening of a CDS spread in response to certain oil events indicates an increase in the level of credit risk and vice versa.  The CDSs for the oil-exporting countries have widened differently in reaction to the drops in oil prices, but they are expected to narrow when those prices surge.  It is widely accepted that oil prices play a major role in determining economic activity in many economies, particularly those of the oil exporters.  In this sense, it has been well documented that oil price volatility shocks have a substantial impact on industrial activity, stock and credit markets performance and economic growth, even though the effects differ considerably across countries and industries.  For example, negative oil price shocks generally lead to an economic slowdown in net oil-exporting countries and have differential impacts on capital market participants, while the effect on economic growth tends to be beneﬁcial for net oil-importing countries.  The recent Eurozone sovereign debt crisis has renewed the debate on the sovereign CDS market.  The perceived risk and dramatic jumps in the sovereign spreads during the crisis, the recent collapse of oil prices since June 2014 and the ensuing elevation in economic uncertainty have motivated us to investigate the impact of oil market uncertainty on sovereign CDS spreads for a group of diverse oil-exporting countries.  The oil-exporting countries included in this study are Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE), which make up most of the GCC bloc, as well as Brazil, Norway, Russia, Mexico, and Venezuela which are important oil producers and exporters.  These countries are selected based on data availability for their CDS spreads.  These diverse oil exporters are different in terms of their relative dependency on oil revenues, amounts of foreign reserves, sizes of foreign debt-to-GDP and levels of credit ratings.  The primary objectives of this paper are twofold.  First, to examine the impact of the oil market uncertainty (proxied by the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index known as the OVX index) on the sovereign credit spreads (proxied by sovereign CDS spreads) of the four GCC and other ﬁve major oil-exporting countries.  Second, to discern the differences in the responses of the sovereign CDS spreads of the different oil exporters to the implied oil volatility shocks since important lessons can be learned from those differences.  The study is conducted by a time-varying approach based on the modiﬁed bootstrap-rolling window procedure in order to study the directional predictability between oil uncertainty and sovereign credit risk for those oil-exporting countries over different time periods, particularly during the times when oil volatility follows rising and falling trends.  To check the robustness of our estimations, we use the quantile dependence measure through the cross-quantilogram approach to detect dependence across the entire range of quantiles or market conditions.  We examine the order of integration of the time series variables by using the Narayan and Popp (2010) unit root test, which accounts for the presence of two structural breaks that the classical Augmented Dickey and Fuller (1979) and the Phillips and Perron (1988) unit root tests cannot.  The presence of structural breaks in the data renders linear or full sample estimates of the implied oil volatility and the sovereign CDS spreads unreliable.  Therefore, because structural changes exist in the oil markets and the countries that depend on them, an analysis that employs the rolling window approach reﬂects more directional predictability between the variables than the linearUsing the daily data from January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2016, our empirical results can be summarized as follows.  (i) There is a signiﬁcant directional predictability from oil uncertainty to CDSs for Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Norway, particularly during the 2014–2015 oil price collapse which could be due to their governments' active ﬁscal stabilization policies.  (ii) A signiﬁcant directional predictability is also found for the foreign exchange reserves poor Mexico mostly during the 2014 oil collapse, and for the likewise Venezuela during the 2011–2013 rising volatility.  (iii) No directional predictability is found in the case of Brazil, probably muted by the country's signiﬁcant political risks. 1 The alarming results for the foreign reserves-poor Mexico and Venezuela may ﬂash a red ﬂag for the foreign reserves-rich GCC countries if such countries run out of their large foreign assets, which are currently depleting their reserves.  This study differs from, and adds to, the related literature on sovereign CDS spread dynamics in several ways.  First, it investigates the directional predictability from the oil market uncertainty to sovereign credit spreads for important oil-exporting countries across different rolling windows based on a time-varying framework in the presence of structural breaks.  This has not been researched before in the literature.  Second, it examines whether the sovereign CDS spreads of these oil-rich countries are more (less) exposed and in varying degrees to the effects of oil market uncertainty, which have been adversely impacted by recent oil price shocks.  Third, our recent sample period (January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2016) allows us to investigate the CDS impact of the recent collapse of oil prices and also contains both low and high volatility subperiods, leading one to discern how diverse oil market uncertainty is transmitted to those sovereign CDS spreads.  Finally, we compare the results between the GCC and the other oil-exporting countries under different market conditions to discern whether lessons can be learned for the future from foreign reserves-poor oil producing countries.  The countries under consideration differ regarding their oil reserves, foreign reserves, population, labour markets, and exchange rate mechanisms among other ﬁnancial and economic speciﬁcations.  The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 reviews the related literature.  Section 3 discusses the empirical model.  Section 4 describes the data and presents preliminary statistics.  Section 5 analyzes the empirical results.  Section 6 gives concluding comments.  2.  Literature review.  The growing importance of both private and sovereign CDS markets has led to the opening of different lines of theoretical and empirical studies.  Many of these studies have investigated the relationship between private CDS spreads and stock market conditions (e. g. , Bystrom, 2006.  Zhang et al. , 2009.  Naifar, 2012, among others) and with bond markets (e. g. , Zhu, 2006.  Wagner, 2008, among others).  Other empirical studies argue that ﬁnancial and economic uncertainty factors should matter for the dynamics of CDS spreads, particularly around and in the wake of the two recent global ﬁnancial crises (e. g. , Sum, 2012.  Antonakakis et al. , 2013.  Li et al. , 2015.  Ko and Lee, 2015.  Wisniewski and Lambe, 2015, among others).  More recently, some empirical studies focus on the impact of oil prices on private CDS spreads.  Da-Fonseca et al.  (2016) examine the relationship between the CDS spreads for the energy market and oil futures price dynamics during the period from 2004 to 2013.  These studies ﬁnd that the relationship between CDS spreads and energy prices is stronger during volatile periods which had strengthened after the 2008–2009 global ﬁnancial crisis.  Lahiani et al.  (2016) investigate the transmission process from oil prices to the sector CDS index spreads for the banking, ﬁnancial services and insurance sectors in the United States from 2004 to 2014.  They ﬁnd no relationship for the short run dynamics between oil prices and the CDS spreads of the banking and ﬁnancial service sectors.  Another strand of the recent empirical CDS literature focuses on the sovereign CDS spreads.  Longstaff et al.  (2011) ﬁnd a link between sovereign CDS spreads and global risk factors.  They conclude that the sovereign CDS spreads can be explained by the U. S.  equity market returns, equity volatility, and bond market risk premia.  Moreover, Ang and Longstaff (2013) show that the systemic risk component of the sovereign CDS spreads is inﬂuenced by global ﬁnancial factors and that there is no relationship with macroeconomic variables.  The studies on sovereign CDSs during and after the recent European sovereign debt crisis focus mainly on the joint dynamics between the sovereign and bank CDS markets (e. g. , Alter and Schuler, 2012.  Dieckmann and Plank, 2012, among others) and the relationship between sovereign risk and spillovers of the ﬁnancial contagion (e. g. , Kalbaska and Gatkowski, 2012, among others).  Despite the increasing shift to researching the sovereign CDS markets, most of the literature is focused on the determinants of sovereign CDS spreads, spillovers and contagion and the relationship with global ﬁnancial and economic uncertainty factors.  Additionally, most of the empirical studies focus mainly on the European area market and a few emerging markets.  The aim of the current study, which considers the recent collapse of oil prices in its sample period, is to shift the investigation to the GCC and other more diverse oil-exporting countries, which has not been researched before, to analyze the directional predictability from the oil market uncertainty to the sovereign CDS markets and draw lessons for the future based on the results of the foreign reserve-rich oil exporting countries.  Further, we deepen the analysis of the strength of the directional dependence during different market conditions by using a timevarying methodology based on the rolling-window causality approach.  We also seek to detect red ﬂags from one group of oil-producing countries that can provide insights into another oil-producing group during different market conditions.  <Middle> Methodology.  Both symmetric (Toda and Yamamoto, 1995) and asymmetric (Hatemi-j, 2012) causality approaches are not free from criticism.  For instance, Shukur and Mantalos (1997) demonstrate that the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) causality test has low explanatory and power properties, and thus misleading causality results for small and medium sample sizes.  Furthermore, Tang (2013) points out that the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) and Hatemi-j (2012) causality approaches are unable to capture the time-varying causality features as these rely on full sample estimates.  To accommodate structural breaks and shifts in parameters, we use the Hurn et al.  (2015) and Shi et al.  (2016) rolling-window causality methods, and also the cross-quantilogram approach as a robustness check.  Hurn et al.  (2015) and Shi et al.  (2016) show that the rollingwindow approach yields the best results in comparison with the forward and recursive rolling approaches for stationary and possibly integrated systems, respectively.  Shi et al.  (2016) also examine the lag-augmented VAR (LA-VAR) rolling-window approach following Toda and Yamamoto (1995).  To examine the directional dependence from oil volatility to sovereign CDS spreads, we apply the bootstrapped rolling window predictability procedure to overcome the above highlighted issues.  Zapata and Rambaldi (1997) note that the test is more convenient and provides efﬁcient results not only for larger samples but also for small samples due to its good size and explanatory power properties.  Furthermore, Mantalos (2000) proves that the bootstrap test exhibits the highest accuracy in all estimates, regardless of the cointegration properties.  These pioneering ﬁndings motivate our choice of the bootstrap Granger causality test, which relies on the following bivariate VAR(p) speciﬁcation.  where εt=(ε1t,ε2t)′ is a zero-mean independent white noise process with the nonsingular covariance matrix ∑.  For a simplistic representation, we separate yt into two sub vectors, the ﬁrst one is related to the CDS spreads of GCC and other oil-exporting countries (y1t), and thesecond one is related to the OVX index (y2t).  Then we rewrite Eq.  (1) in the following form.  where, ϕij(L)=∑k=1 p ϕij,kLk,i,j=1,2 and L is the lag operator deﬁned as Lkxt= xt −k. 2 In this setting, we test the null hypothesis that the OVX does not Granger-cause the CDS spread by imposing the zero restrictions ϕ12,i=0 for i=1,2,…,p.  To overcome the issue of structural instability resulting from structural breaks, we employ the rolling and recursive rolling window Granger causality approaches.  The structural changes may be the cause of the shift in parameters that seems to alter the direction of the dependence between the variables.  For the rolling window approach, we ﬁx the rolling window size, and then the directional dependence is determined for each subsample, and the ﬁxed rolling window moves forward until the last sample's observation is reached.  The recursive rolling approach estimates the test statistics for a backwardexpanding sample sequence.  For each observation of interest (f ∈ [ f0, 1]), the Wald statistics are computed for the backward expanding sample sequence.  As indicated above, the end point of the sample sequence is ﬁxed at f.  However, the starting point of the samples extends backward from (f – f0), which is the minimum sample size to accommodate the regression, to 0.  The Wald statistic obtained for each subsample regression is denoted by Wf2 (f1), and the sup-Wald statistic is deﬁned as this.  Let fe and ff denote the origination and termination points in the directional relationship, respectively.  These points are estimated as the ﬁrst chronological observation that respectively exceeds or falls below the critical value.  In a single switch case, the dating rules are given by the following crossing times where cv and scv are the corresponding critical values of the Wf and SWf statistics, respectively.  Now, suppose there are multiple switches in the sample period.  We denote the origination and terminations of the ith directional dependence by fie and fif for successive episodes i = 1, 2, …, I.  The estimations of the dates associated with the ﬁrst episode (i. e. , f1e and f1f) are exactly the same as those for the single switch case.  For i ≥ 2, fie and fif are estimated as follows.  Further, following Shi et al.  (2016), we consider both the standard test statistics and the heteroskedastic-consistent versions of the tests.  The heteroskedastic-consistent subsample Wald statistic is denoted by this.  The simulation results of Hurn et al.  (2015) suggest that the rolling window approach has the most severe size distortion but also has the highest correct detection rate.  In a single direction scenario, the performance of the recursive rolling approach is relatively balanced - both the test size and correct detection rates are satisfactory.  Nevertheless, in a case where there are bi-directional episodes in the sample period, the recursive rolling algorithm has difﬁculty detecting the second shorter episode, whereas the performance of the rolling window approach is relatively better.  We utilize the framework of Hurn et al.  (2015) and determine the optimal lag length by employing the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each estimation window.  Notably, the Wald statistic based on the LA-VAR model follows a standard chi-squared distribution (Toda and Yamamoto, 1995).  However, we rather prefer to use the bootstrap Wald test approach to better approximate the ﬁnite sample distribution (see for example Balcilar et al. , 2010).  4.  Data description.  We use the implied volatility index of the WTI crude oil price, and the oil-exporters' sovereign CDS spreads to detect the casual links going from the oil market uncertainty to the sovereign credit risk of the GCC and the other oil-exporting countries.  The CBOE Crude oil ETF volatility index (OVX) measures the market's expectations of the 30-day volatility of crude oil prices by applying the VIX methodology to the United States Oil Fund options spanning a broad range of strikeThe index is calculated from the market prices of the out-of-themoney calls and puts without the use of any pricing models.  The volatility used to price options not only includes the consensus of the market regarding future volatility but is also more accurate and contains a premium for fear.  Therefore, this index is more suitable in our context than the realized or historical volatility measures that are less informative on the implied volatility, and do not account for fear.  The sovereign credit risk is the risk of a government becoming unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations, and we have proxied this credit risk by using the spreads of sovereign credit default swaps.  In our sample, we have included major oil-exporting GCC countries.  Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE), as well as ﬁve other oil-exporting countries.  Brazil, Mexico, Norway, Russia and Venezuela.  The selection of these countries is based on the CDS data availability for the period under consideration, which is not possible for other oil-exporting countries such as Algeria, Libya, Nigeria, Angola, etc.  The weekly data totaling 392 observations cover the period January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2016. 3 All the data of our study are sourced from DataStream.  The descriptive statistics of the data series are shown in Table 1.  The variables are transformed into the natural logarithmic form.  Notably, this table indicates that the CDS spreads of the exchange reservespoor and minor oil producer Bahrain are on average more than double any of those of the other GCC member countries.  On the other hand, Qatar has the lowest average CDS spreads among the GCC countries, most likely due to its abundant exports of natural gas which complement its oil revenue, its huge relative foreign reserves and its prudent ﬁscal measures.  For the other ﬁve oil-exporting countries, the foreign exchange-poor and politically unstable Venezuela has an alarming CDS spread, while Norway which has the greatest sovereign wealth fund in the world and relatively more diversiﬁed economy has the lowest.  The Jarque-Bera test rejects the null hypothesis of normality at the 1% level of signiﬁcance, conﬁrming the non-normality of the series under consideration, which is all supported by the measures of skewness and kurtosis.  Fig.  1 displays the time trend of the OVX index and the sovereign CDS spreads in the natural logarithmic form for the four GCC and the other ﬁve oil-exporting countries, respectively.  A rising trend in the OVX and credit spreads is noted during 2010–2011 and from 2015 onward.  The ﬁrst date corresponds to the European sovereign debt crisis, while the second one reﬂects the heart of the recent collapse of the oil prices.  <Conclusion> Empirical results and discussion.  5. 1.  Unit root testing.  The standard unit root tests lack power in the presence of structural breaks in the series.  The oil market is known to have structural breaks due to the business cycle and the geopolitical risk.  The CDS market should also exhibit structural breaks as it picks up shocks in the oil market and the macroeconomy.  The presence of those breaks has implications for the validity of the unit root tests.  To account for those breaks and to ensure the robustness of the results, we employ the ADF-type unit root test proposed by Narayan and Popp (2010), since it allows for two structural breaks in both the levels and slopes of the series.  This test does not require an a priori knowledge of the timing of possible structural breaks because the break dates are endogenously determined within the model.  Another distinctive feature of this test is that the breaks are allowed under the null and alternative hypotheses.  Since the Narayan and Popp (2010) unit root test has already been widely employed in the economic and ﬁnancial literature, we do not reproduce the technical details of this test.  The results of the Narayan and Popp (2010) unit root test are summarized in Table 2.
