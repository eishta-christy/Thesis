Accruals are fundamental to ﬁnancial reporting and are the underlying innovation of accounting.  While a long line of prior
research notes that accruals are likely to be a function of fundamental economic forces, little is known empirically or theoretically
about how economic factors impact the level of a ﬁrm's accruals (e. g. , Dechow Name, 1995; Bernard and Skinner, 1996; Dechow Name, 2010; Gerakos, 2012; Owens Name, 2013).  Further, prior research generally disaggregates accruals at time tþ1 into discretionary and non-discretionary components based on ﬁnancial information observed at time tþ1; therefore, the research has
provided little guidance for forming expectations of accruals based on ex ante ﬁrm characteristics.  In this study, we consider
accruals as a form of investment and examine whether theoretical predictions from a real options-based investment framework
provide insights for forming expectations of accruals based on ex ante economic factors. 
Prior research in accounting suggests that accruals at least partially reﬂect deliberate investment choices by the ﬁrm
(Fairﬁeld Name, 2003; Zhang, 2007; Dechow Name, 2008; Wu Name, 2010; Bushman Name, 2011; Allen Name, 2013; Momente
Name, 2013; Arif and Lee, 2014).  In addition, a large literature in economics and ﬁnance adopts a real options approach to
investment decision-making and suggests a negative relation between investment and volatility (e. g. , Bernanke, 1983;
McDonald and Siegel, 1986; Ingersoll and Ross, 1992; Dixit and Pindyck, 1994; Schwartz and Trigeorgis, 2004; Grenadier and
Malenko, 2010). 2 The intuition for the expected negative relation between investment and volatility is as follows.  Investment is costly, and sunk costs cannot be recovered.  Therefore, when ﬁrms make investment decisions, they trade off the
returns earned from investing today against the beneﬁt from delaying investment to the future, when information or
business conditions may be better.  Taking into account the beneﬁt of postponing investment – known as the “option to
wait” – means that since higher volatility increases the value of the option to wait, higher volatility dampens investment
because ﬁrms prefer to “wait and see” instead of investing immediately.  Thus, higher (lower) volatility is associated with
lower (higher) investment.  Adopting the investment perspective of accruals, our ﬁrst hypothesis is that a ﬁrm's level of
accruals is negatively associated with volatility. 
We note, however, that this prediction from the real options framework may not directly apply to accruals.  For example,
models of optimal inventory suggest that managers have incentives to avoid inventory shortages and therefore increase
inventory levels as demand volatility rises (e. g. , Petruzzi and Dada, 1999; Cachon and Terwiesch, 2013).  This research
therefore suggests a positive relation between investment in ﬁnished goods inventory and volatility.  Despite this potentially
countervailing force, we adopt the investment perspective and rely on the real options framework to predict a negative
relation between the level of a ﬁrm's net working capital accruals and volatility. 
Second, we investigate the role of ﬁnancial distress in shaping the relation between accruals and volatility.  Eisdorfer
(2008) models the investment decisions of ﬁnancially distressed ﬁrms using a real options framework and ﬁnds that
ﬁnancial distress weakens the negative effect of volatility on investment.  This is because shareholders of distressed ﬁrms
have an incentive to invest when volatility is higher since they enjoy the beneﬁts if things go well, while bondholders bear
the costs if things go badly.  Accordingly, we predict that the negative association between the level of working capital
accruals and volatility is less pronounced for distressed ﬁrms. 
Third, we exploit the real options framework to form predictions regarding the relation between the length of the
operating cycle and the association between accruals and volatility.  The operating cycle measures the average time between
the disbursement of cash to produce a product and the receipt of cash from the sale of the product (Dechow, 1994);
therefore, ﬁrms with a longer operating cycle have greater exposure to changing business conditions and a wider range of
possible accrual investment outcomes.  This suggests that the option to wait is more valuable for ﬁrms with a longer
operating cycle.  Thus, we hypothesize that the sensitivity of net working capital accruals to volatility is stronger for ﬁrms
with a longer operating cycle. 
Fourth, we investigate whether the asset and liability components of net working capital accruals have differing sensitivities to volatility.  We predict that volatility not only negatively affects current asset accruals but also current liability
accruals, given that liabilities partially ﬁnance investments and thus positively co-vary with investment by nature.  However,
we expect current asset accruals to be more sensitive to volatility than current liability accruals since investment decisions
have ﬁrst-order implications for asset accruals but affect liability accruals only to the extent that managers use liabilities
instead of internally generated cash ﬂows or equity issuances to ﬁnance the investment. 
To empirically test our predictions, we examine the relation between year-ahead working capital accruals and expected
volatility.  We highlight that our approach is distinct from prior accounting literature that disaggregates accruals into discretionary and non-discretionary components (e. g. , Healy, 1985; DeAngelo, 1986; Jones, 1991; Dechow Name, 1995).  Speciﬁcally, while the prior earnings management literature models total working capital accruals in year tþ1 as a function of
explanatory variables which are also measured in year tþ1 (e. g.  Healy, 1985; DeAngelo, 1986; Jones, 1991; Dechow Name,
1995), we model accruals in year tþ1 as a function of characteristics in year t.  Further, we view accruals as a form of
investment, rather than as a component of proﬁtability.  As such, our model is grounded in the real options-based investment framework, in which measures of the ﬁrm's characteristics and economic environment (such as expected volatility,
ﬁrm size, market-to-book, leverage, and cash ﬂows) are used as inputs into investment decisions (e. g.  Hayashi, 1982; Dixit
and Pindyck ,1994; Gilchrist and Himmelberg, 1995; Eisdorfer, 2008). 
Our empirical analysis begins by replicating the ﬁnding in Eisdorfer (2008) that there is a signiﬁcant negative relation between
year-ahead capital expenditures and expected volatility for a sample of manufacturing ﬁrms.  We then extend the analysis to net
working capital accruals and ﬁnd a robust negative relation between year-ahead net working capital accruals and expected volatility
in this manufacturing ﬁrm sample.  Next, we broaden the sample to all non-ﬁnancial and non-utility ﬁrms and ﬁnd, consistent with
the economic theory, that higher expected volatility has a dampening effect on year-ahead net working capital investment.  In
addition, consistent with our predictions, we ﬁnd that the association between year-ahead net working capital accruals and expected
volatility is less pronounced for ﬁrms in ﬁnancial distress and more pronounced for ﬁrms with a longer operating cycle. 
We then decompose year-ahead net working capital accruals into its asset and liability components and examine the relation of
each component with expected volatility.  Consistent with our expectations, we ﬁnd that both current asset and current liability
accruals are negatively associated with expected volatility.  Moreover, asset accruals are more sensitive to expected volatility than
liability accruals, giving rise to the overall negative relation between net working capital accruals and expected volatility. 
We provide two types of robustness tests.  First, we note that our dependent variable (i. e. , year-ahead accruals) is affected not
only by expected volatility but also by expected demand.  Thus, as a robustness test, we include additional controls for expected
demand as of the end of year t – including the consensus analyst forecast of year-ahead sales, the median consensus analyst
forecast of year-ahead sales for the industry, and prior 12-month stock returns – and continue to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant negative
relation between year-ahead accruals and expected volatility.  Second, we acknowledge that year-ahead accruals also contain an
unexpected component that may be affected by unexpected demand in year tþ1.  While our primary speciﬁcation controls for
unexpected demand with year-ahead stock returns, we explore its robustness to additional controls for unexpected demand –
including the year-ahead change in sales, year-ahead employee growth, and the year-ahead change in the consensus analyst sales
forecast – and ﬁnd that our results are robust to the inclusion of these additional controls. 
Finally, we examine the implications of the investment perspective of accruals and the real options-based investment
framework for earnings management research.  We note that the primary aim of our study is not to develop a new accrualbased earnings management proxy; however, we provide evidence that the residuals from an investment-based expected
accrual model have discriminating ability for identifying ﬁrms that just meet or beat earnings expectations.  In fact, the
residuals from the investment-based expected accrual model appear to have more discriminating ability for identifying
ﬁrms that meet or beat expectations than those from the commonly-employed performance-adjusted modiﬁed Jones
model.  This result is particularly striking given that our expected accrual model is based on information known ex ante,
whereas the performance-adjusted modiﬁed Jones model is based on information only known in year tþ1. 
Our study provides important contributions to the literature.  Understanding the properties of accruals is among the chief
goals of ﬁnancial accounting research.  Dechow Name (2010), DeFond (2010) and Ball (2013) and others express concern that
there is little theory to guide researchers in understanding the economic factors that shape the level of a ﬁrm's accruals.  We
draw on real options-based investment theory and document that expected volatility has a pervasive effect on year-ahead
accruals.  Further, we show that the investment-based theory applies more strongly for ﬁrms not facing ﬁnancial distress and
for ﬁrms with a longer operating cycle.  Accordingly, we provide insight into the ex ante economic characteristics that shape
a ﬁrm's level of accruals and therefore provide guidance for forming expectations of accruals. 
Our ﬁndings also contribute to the economics and ﬁnance literature studying the factors that shape investment.  This
literature has focused on ﬁrms’ capital expenditure decisions and has not considered the predictions for accrual-based
investment.  We believe that examining how the investment theories apply to capital expenditures versus accruals, both
similarly and differentially, can provide greater insights into the investment policies of ﬁrms. 
The paper proceeds as follows.  Section 2 presents the background and hypothesis development.  Section 3 presents
variable deﬁnitions and descriptive statistics.  Section 4 presents empirical results, and Section 5 concludes this paper. 
2.  Hypotheses development. 
Real-world investment decisions tend to share three features, which collectively motivate real option-based investment
theory (Dixit, 1992).  First, ﬁrms cannot perfectly forecast the future because the business environment has ongoing
uncertainty and information arrives gradually.  Second, investment is costly and difﬁcult to reverse due to frictions such as
sunk costs, i. e.  investment tends to be at least partially “irreversible”.  Third, an investment opportunity does not generally
disappear if no investment is made immediately, i. e.  ﬁrms generally have the option to postpone investment to the future. 
Under the real options-based investment framework, a manager's decision to invest involves a tradeoff between
investing immediately or instead postponing investment to the future.  On the one hand, the beneﬁt of immediate investment is that the ﬁrm is able to start enjoying returns from the investment.  On the other hand, the beneﬁt of waiting is that
the manager can gain more information about the value of the investment and take advantage of any improvements in
business conditions that occur in the meantime.  This beneﬁt of waiting introduces an opportunity cost to investing today.  At
the point when the beneﬁts of waiting equal the costs of waiting, investment occurs.  When volatility is higher, the beneﬁt of
waiting (commonly referred to in the literature as the “option to wait”) is higher, and ﬁrms become more cautious in their
investment behavior because they prefer to “wait and see” what happens in the future. 3 Motivated by this framework, a
large theoretical literature predicts a negative relation between investment and volatility (e. g.  Bernanke, 1983; McDonald
and Siegel, 1986; Ingersoll and Ross, 1992; Dixit and Pindyck, 1994; Schwartz and Trigeorgis, 2004; Grenadier and Malenko,
2010), and the empirical evidence generally supports this prediction (e. g.  Pindyck and Solimano, 1993; Leahy and Whited,
1996; Guiso and Parigi, 1999; Bond and Cummins, 2004; Eisdorfer, 2008; Badertscher Name, 2013). 4
We adopt the investment perspective of accruals in this paper.  Fairﬁeld Name (2003) note that accruals are not only a
component of proﬁtability but also a component of investment.  Zhang (2007) and Dechow Name (2008) support the
investment role of accruals and conclude that the accrual anomaly documented by Sloan (1996) is primarily attributable to
the role of accruals as a form of investment.  In addition, investment in the form of accruals reﬂects the three features that
motivate real options-based investment theory.  First, ﬁrms cannot perfectly forecast the payoff from working capital
accruals.  Second, working capital accruals are at least partially irreversible. 5 Third, ﬁrms generally have at least some control
over the timing of working capital accruals.  For example, ﬁrms can postpone working capital investment via managing the
timing of inventory purchases and/or the extension of credit to customers.  Therefore, to the extent that accruals are shaped
by investment decisions, we expect the predictions of real options-based investment theory to apply to working capital
accruals. 
We note, however, that there are potentially countervailing features of accruals that may weaken the descriptive
power of the real options-based investment theory for accruals.  First, accruals can be viewed as a secondary outcome of
the earnings process that is aimed at resolving the timing issues associated with the use of cash ﬂows as a performance
metric (Dechow, 1994).  This suggests that accruals are shaped by the accounting standards that pertain to each speciﬁc
accrual (Healy and Wahlen, 1999).  Second, accruals can also be viewed as the component of proﬁtability that involves
relatively greater subjectivity.  Thus, accruals may be subject to unintentional mismeasurement (Richardson Name, 2005)
and/or intentional manipulation (Sloan, 1996; Xie, 2001; Dechow Name, 2010).  In fact, Zang (2012) ﬁnds that ﬁrms engage
in income-increasing accrual-based earnings management when they have more accounting ﬂexibility, suggesting that
they might also engage in income-increasing earnings management during periods of greater volatility. 6 Third, research
on optimal inventory levels indirectly suggests a positive relation between accruals and volatility.  Speciﬁcally, models of
optimal inventory suggest that managers have incentives to avoid inventory shortages, or stock-outs, and therefore
increase ﬁnished goods inventory levels as demand volatility rises (e. g. , Petruzzi and Dada, 1999; Cachon and Terwiesch,In short, even if accruals are partially shaped by investment decisions, the simultaneous inﬂuence of diverse forces on
accruals may obscure any negative relation between net working capital accruals and volatility as predicted by the real
options theory. 8 Despite this caveat, we adopt the investment perspective of accruals and rely on the real options framework
to predict a negative relation between accruals and volatility. 9 This leads to our ﬁrst hypothesis:
H1.  The level of working capital accruals is negatively associated with volatility. 
Second, we hypothesize that ﬁnancial distress plays a role in shaping the relation between accruals and volatility. 
Eisdorfer (2008) models the investment decisions of ﬁnancially distressed ﬁrms using a real options framework and ﬁnds
that ﬁnancial distress weakens the negative effect of volatility on investment.  The intuition is that because shareholders of
distressed ﬁrms enjoy the beneﬁts if things go well while bondholders bear the costs if things go badly, the asset substitution problem (Galai and Masulis, 1976; Jensen and Meckling, 1976) leads to an incentive for shareholders to invest when
volatility is higher.  This leads to our second hypothesis:
H2.  The negative association between the level of working capital accruals and volatility is less pronounced for ﬁrms facing
ﬁnancial distress. 
Our third hypothesis predicts an increasing sensitivity of accruals to volatility as the ﬁrm's operating cycle lengthens.  The
operating cycle measures the average time between the disbursement of cash to produce a product and the receipt of cash
from the sale of the product (Dechow, 1994).  A ﬁrm with a longer operating cycle has greater exposure to changing business
conditions.  More speciﬁcally, a longer operating cycle leads to a wider range of possible investment outcomes, which makes
the option to wait more valuable.  Thus, we predict volatility to have a stronger dampening effect on working capital accruals
in ﬁrms with a longer operating cycle. 10
There are, however, reasonable arguments for why the negative relation between accruals and volatility may be weaker
for ﬁrms with a longer operating cycle.  Zang (2012) suggests that greater ﬂexibility leads to income-increasing accrualbased earnings management, and, consistent with this notion, documents a positive relation between the level of abnormal
accruals and the length of the ﬁrm's operating cycle.  Given that higher volatility and a longer operating cycle may lead to
greater ﬂexibility and more opportunities for income-increasing earnings management, her ﬁndings suggest that the
negative relation between accruals and volatility may be weaker for ﬁrms with a longer operating cycle.  Despite this reasonable argument for the null hypothesis, we present our third hypothesis based on our theoretical economic framework as
follows:
H3.  The negative association between the level of working capital accruals and volatility is more pronounced for ﬁrms with
a longer operating cycle. 
Our fourth hypothesis focuses on the differential sensitivities of the asset and liability components of net working capital
accruals to volatility.  While we expect liabilities to be negatively associated with volatility because liabilities partially
ﬁnance investments and thus naturally positively co-vary with the factors that shape investment, we predict the asset
component of net working capital accruals to have a more pronounced negative sensitivity to volatility than the liability
component of net working capital accruals.  This is because investment decisions have ﬁrst-order implications for asset
accruals but affect liabilities only to the extent that managers use liabilities instead of internally generated cash ﬂows or
equity issuances for ﬁnancing investment.  Thus, we expect assets to co-vary with volatility more strongly than liabilities. 
This leads to our fourth hypothesis:
H4.  The asset component of net working capital accruals is more sensitive to volatility than the liability component. 
Finally, we predict that the investment perspective of accruals and the real options-based investment framework is
useful for identifying ﬁrms that manage earnings through accruals.  Speciﬁcally, accruals that are not explained by the
investment perspective and real options-based framework are more likely to be associated with earnings management. 
Therefore, we predict that unexpected accruals – deﬁned as the residual from our investment-based accrual model –
provide information about earnings management.  This leads to our ﬁfth hypothesis:
H5.  Unexpected accruals from the investment-based accrual model are associated with earnings management. 
<Middle> Variable deﬁnitions, sample, and descriptive statistics. 
3. 1.  Model and variable deﬁnitions. 
Our analyses begin with a replication of the model in Eisdorfer (2008) to examine the relation between year-ahead
working capital accruals and expected volatility and, for comparison to the prior ﬁnance literature, the relation between
year-ahead capital expenditures and expected volatility.  Speciﬁcally, we estimate the following regression model,
which follows the model in Eisdorfer (2008).  The dependent variable is the ﬁrm's year-ahead (i. e. , year tþ1) capital
expenditures scaled by beginning assets (Capital Expenditures) and the primary variable of interest is the expected industry
volatility as of the end of year t (Expected Industry Volatility). 
Consistent with prior ﬁnance research (e. g. , Eisdorfer, 2008), Expected Industry Volatility is estimated with a generalized
autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model using all daily data available in year t. 11 We note that industry
expected volatility is intended to capture the volatility faced by the ﬁrm's industry.  Our regression model also follows
Eisdorfer (2008) with respect to control variables that capture the ﬁrm's size, market-to-book ratio, leverage, and cash ﬂows
at the end of year t.  In addition, consistent with Eisdorfer (2008), we control for the state of the economy in the year of the
investment using three macroeconomic variables measured in year tþ1: a recessionary period indicator, the default spread,
and the interest rate.  These variables have the added beneﬁt of controlling for unexpected macroeconomic changes in year
tþ1, which may affect unexpected investment during that year. 
As a ﬁrst test of the relation between year-ahead accruals and expected volatility (H1), we substitute year-ahead net
working capital accruals into Eq.  (1) in place of capital expenditures as the dependent variable. 
The dependent variable, Working Capital Accruals, is year-ahead (i. e. , year tþ1) operating accruals before depreciation for
the ﬁrm.  More speciﬁcally, Working Capital Accruals is deﬁned as year-ahead growth in operating working capital (other
than tax liabilities) scaled by beginning total assets.  This deﬁnition of accruals is consistent with prior research (Sloan, 1996;
Fairﬁeld Name, 2003). 12
We also examine the relation between year-ahead net working capital accruals (capital expenditures) and expected ﬁrm
volatility (Expected Volatility).  Expected Volatility is calculated similarly to Expected Industry Volatility using daily ﬁrm-speciﬁc
stock returns (in lieu of daily industry stock returns) available as of the end of year t. 13 Speciﬁcally, we apply a GARCH (1,1)
model to the entire series of daily ﬁrm-speciﬁc stock returns in year t, requiring at least 200 daily return observations. 14 To
test for a relation between accruals (capital expenditures) and expected ﬁrm volatility, we use a similar regression model as
Eq.  (2) (Eq.  (1)) but with Expected Volatility as the explanatory variable of interest.  For brevity, we only denote the working
capital accrual version of this model. 
While the Eisdorfer (2008) model provides the foundation for our real options-based investment model, it is
particularly important (given our focus) to control for the unexpected component of accruals in year tþ1.  That is,
we note that our dependent variable (i. e. , year-ahead accruals) includes an expected component as well as an
unexpected component that is likely associated with unexpected demand.  As such, we augment Eqs.  (2) and (3) with a
proxy for unexpected demand: stock returns in year tþ1.  In addition, we incorporate year ﬁxed effects to control
for any omitted macroeconomic forces that may inﬂuence unexpected accruals.  These additions lead to the following
equation,
where Expected Volatility is either expected ﬁrm volatility (Expected Volatility) or expected industry volatility (Expected
Industry Volatility). 
To test whether the relation between expected volatility and year-ahead accruals is less pronounced for ﬁrms facing
ﬁnancial distress (H2), we augment Eq.  (4) with a distress indicator variable (Distress) and an interaction term between
Distress and Expected Volatility.  We deﬁne distressed ﬁrms (i. e. , Distress¼1) as those with an Altman's Z-score below 1. 81 in
year t.  As an alternative test, we also estimate Eq.  (4) separately for healthy ﬁrms and distressed ﬁrms and test for a
difference in the Expected Volatility coefﬁcients. 
We take a similar approach to test hypothesis H3 that the relation between expected volatility and year-ahead accruals is
more pronounced for ﬁrms with a longer operating cycle.  That is, we augment Eq.  (4) with an operating cycle ranking
variable (OpCycle) and an interaction term between OpCycle and Expected Volatility.  We deﬁne OpCycle as the scaled quintile
ranking of the ﬁrm's operating cycle length as deﬁned in Dechow (1994). 15 We also estimate Eq.  (4) separately for each
operating cycle quintile. 
In our tests regarding the ability of the investment-based framework to identify ﬁrms that manage earnings, we compare
the ability of the investment-based expected accrual model to the ability of the widely-used performance-adjusted modiﬁed
Jones model to identify ﬁrms that meet or beat analyst forecasts.  We calculate ‘expected’ and ‘unexpected’ accruals by
decomposing year-ahead Working Capital Accruals into its ﬁtted values and residual values, respectively, from our
investment-based accrual model.  Speciﬁcally, we estimate Eq.  (4) augmented with Distress and OpCycle and their interactions with Expected Volatility.  We estimate the model using annual, cross-sectional regressions within two digit SIC codes
excluding the year-ahead (i. e. , year tþ1) control variables – Returns, Recession Indicator, Default Spread, and Interest Rate –
and the year ﬁxed effects.  For clarity, this results in the following regression equation. 
We apply a similar procedure using the performance-adjusted modiﬁed Jones model to partition total net working
accruals into ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ components using the following equation. 
We deﬁne the variables used in model (6) as follows: 1/AT is one divided by year t total assets; Δsales is the year tþ1
change in sales scaled by year t total assets; PPE is the ending year tþ1 balance of property, plant and equipment scaled by
year t total assets; and ROA is the year tþ1 operating income after depreciation divided by year t total assets. 
Eq.  (6) is a common variant of the modiﬁed Jones (1991) model; however, we use working capital accruals (i. e. , operating
accruals excluding depreciation expense) in lieu of total accruals (including depreciation and longer-term accruals).  The
model includes ﬁrm size, growth in sales less growth in accounts receivable, and property, plant and equipment (Dechow
Name, 1995).  The model also controls for ﬁrm performance (Kothari Name, 2005).  It is important to note that the explanatory
variables in the performance-adjusted modiﬁed Jones model (Eq.  (6)) are only observable in year tþ1, whereas the
explanatory variables in the investment-based model (Eq.  (5)) are observable in year t. 
3. 2.  Sample and descriptive statistics. 
Table 1 provides the details of our sample selection.  Our sample begins with all observations on Compustat from 1964 to
2013 with 12 months of trading data, which leads to 172,822 ﬁrm-year observations.  We delete 5,327 observations that are
not U. S.  corporations or that have other than ordinary common stock.  We exclude 18,148 ﬁnancial and utility ﬁrms (SIC
49XX; 60XX-69XX).  In addition, we exclude 10,317 (7,567) observations that do not have data to calculate Capital Expenditures, Working Capital Accruals, and lagged total assets (the control variables and ZSCORE).  We delete 1,239 observations
with less than ﬁve ﬁrm observations for the industry (two-digit SIC) and year.
