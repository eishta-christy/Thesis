 1.  Introduction  Competition for CEO talent has increased over the past few decades.  As described in Frydman and Jenter (2010) and  Murphy (2013) , ﬁrms now regularly hire outsiders as CEOs instead of internal candidates, competing with other ﬁrms or  poaching their CEOs, aided by compensation consultants and executive placement ﬁrms that create a market for CEOs and  make compensation packages easier to compare.   What effects does such competition for CEO talent have.  How does it affect the compensation contracts that ﬁrms and  CEOs sign, the incentive power of those contracts, and the value that ﬁrms and CEOs create.  The aim of this paper is  to analyze the effects of introducing competition in a setting with realistic informational frictions, in order to understand  how these frictions and the forces of competition jointly determine the outcome.  We show that the ascent of competition  increases the incentive power of CEO compensation contracts.  This mitigates ineﬃciencies from low-powered incentive contracts that arise when ﬁrms do not compete, but it also introduces new ineﬃciencies caused by excessively high-powered  incentive compensation.  Which setup generates larger ineﬃciencies depends on the informational frictions.   We incorporate the following informational frictions in our model.  Firms are uncertain whether a CEO has high or low  talent.  they cannot observe a CEO’s decisions.  a CEO can misreport her performance.  and the long-term ﬁrm value is a noisy  measure of how much value a CEO added.  We are particularly interested in the role of misreporting in our results.
