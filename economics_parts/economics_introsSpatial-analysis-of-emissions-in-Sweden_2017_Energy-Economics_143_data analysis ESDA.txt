 1.  Introduction The nexus between environmental quality (e. g.  pollution) and economic development has received much focus for many decades.  The main objective of this paper is to empirically investigate the pollution and income relationship across all Swedish municipalities from a spatial econometric perspective.  Our approach is motivated by recent but growing literature emphasizing the importance of the spatial dimension on this link and the implications of ignoring it (e. g.  Burnett et al. , 2013a, 2013b).  The emissions and income nexus is often modelled within the framework of the so-called environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, which posits an inverted U-shaped relationship between emissions and income, a curvature likely explained by technological progress and changes in preferences from income growth.  The EKC literature is replete with empirical modelling of different environmental quality indicators.  The evidence for many pollutants can however be best described as mixed.  Grossman and Krueger (1991, 1993, 1995) were among the ﬁrst authors to empirically examine the EKC hypothesis.  In their papers, Grossman and Krueger found the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between air quality (SO2 emission and “smoke”) and economic growth (per capita GDP).  The inverted U-shaped relationship implied that the two pollutants' concentration increased at lower per capita income levels but decreased with GDP growth at higher levels of income after a certain trajectory.  Selden and Song (1994) corroborated Grossman and Krueger (1991) after considering four air pollutants (suspended particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide) and per capita GDP1 relationship.  The EKC literature is associated with several criticisms (see Stern, 2004.  Kijima et al. , 2010.  Kaika and Zervas, 2013 for EKC survey).  Criticisms of the EKC have centered among others on poor econometric applications, limited single country studies using long historical time series data, lack of theoretical insights/foundation, neglect of leakage of dirty production from developed to developing countries (e. g.  Stern, 2002.  Dinda, 2004).  However, this paper focuses on only one but important incipient criticism.  It relates to biased and inconsistent EKC estimates arising from model misspeciﬁcation due to omission of spatial interaction effects in emissions data if signiﬁcantly present (e. g.  Rupasingha et al. , 2004.  Maddison, 2006.  Burnett et al. , 2013a, 2013b.  Aklin, 2016).  Failure to capture spatial interactions in the data, if signiﬁcantly present, might bias the estimated results which might affect policy inferences.  It is in regard to this criticism and the need for a detailed within country study that this paper derives its motivation.  Utilizing advances in geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial econometrics in applied settings, we model the pollution-income relationship for the following emissions.  carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM2. 5 and PM10) and total suspended particulates (TSP).  Even though selection of these emissions is not guided by any formal criteria, we have reason to believe their importance in the Swedish environmental policy/code is not in doubt.  CO2 emissions continue to be one of the major components of greenhouse gases (GHGs) locally and globally which contributes signiﬁcantly to climate change.  In Sweden, CO2 emissions are based on use of different classes of fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and oil products.  Emissions from transportation are considered a major source of concern in Sweden.  The other pollutants are also important sources driving air quality in Sweden and feature prominently in all reports of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and other environmental agencies (see e. g.  Gustafsson and Kindbom, 2014.  SEPA, 2016).  SO2 emissions from road trafﬁc, shipping and heating from industrial and other sources are still a major concern even though emission levels have been reducing in the last two decades or so.  Indeed particulates, CO and the other emissions have been established to impact adversely on human health, mortality and related effects besides generally worsening air quality in a particular area (e. g.  Henschel et al. , 2013.  Caiazzo et al. , 2013).  Guided by the spatial nature of emissions, we tested for spatial effects and estimated a spatial Durbin model (SDM) to capture this potential spillover in order to correctly analyze the EKC for the selected emissions.  Spatial effects could operate in our setting through many channels.  Spatial correlation could occur because neighbouring municipalities might share similar economic/business activities, pollution cycles and some meteorological (natural) attributes such as direction and average speed of the wind, precipitation, relative atmospheric humidity, transportation and spatially correlated unobservables (or omitted variables) that drive pollution levels.  Other channels could arise through strategic interaction between municipalities' emissions targets (policy), cooperation in air quality monitoring and control, transportation linkages among others.  While some of these variables are difﬁcult to measure and were not available to us, we believe, and it has been shown in the literature, that air pollution levels are likely to be spatially correlated.  We fully utilize the potential beneﬁts from an empirical model speciﬁcation that is able to capture the impact of emission levels not only in adjacent municipalities on own emissions but also how spillover in economic activities could affect neighbouring pollution levels.  The modelling is undertaken in all 290 municipalities for the period 2005–2013.  We ﬁnd evidence in support of the EKC for CO2, SO2, NOX, PM2. 5, PM10, TSP and potentially CO in the presence of signiﬁcant spatial spillovers.  Our contribution to the literature is twofold.  First, we contribute to the relatively small but growing EKC in-country literature for several emissions from a spatial perspective.  Secondly, ﬁndings hold promise for public policy coordination considerations as far as pollution control in Sweden is concerned.  Understanding the dynamics of geographical distribution of emission sources can effectively aid mitigation policies as well as inﬂuencing economic activities (Zhao et al. ,The remainder of the paper proceeds according to the following structure.  Section 2 discusses related literature.  Details of the empirical spatial econometric models as well as data issues are covered in Section 3.  Section 4 presents the empirics and discussion of the results.  We conclude in Section 5 with some brief remarks.  2.  Related literature.  In this section, a brief survey of the EKC literature as it relates to this paper is undertaken.  Following the initial inﬂuential work by Grossman and Krueger (1991, 1993, 1995) and Selden and Song (1994), studies on the pollution-income nexus have grown substantially.  Many studies since these seminal papers have modelled the EKC hypothesis by regressing either air or water quality on income per capita (e. g.  Stern and Common, 2001.  Stern, 2002).  Other papers have motivated inclusion of covariates beside income to avert the omitted variable bias problem associated with some studies.  Variables such as population density, social capital (e. g.  trust), average years of education, income inequality among other demographic, economic and related variables have been controlled for (see e. g.  Selden and Song, 1994.  Grossman and Krueger, 1995.  Carson et al. , 1997).  Grossman and Krueger (1995) failed to ﬁnd evidence to the effect that environmental quality decreases steadily with economic growth.  The new evidence was that economic growth induces an initial environmental deterioration followed by a subsequent phase of improvement.  They ﬁnd the turning points for most pollutants in their study to be US$8000 per capita income.  Millimet et al.  (2003) on the other hand considered both the standard parametric framework as well as a ﬂexible semi-parametric alternative to test for the EKC hypothesis for U. S.  state-level SO2 and NOx.  They ﬁnd overwhelming evidence to reject the parametric approach.  Paudel et al.  (2005) also estimated parametric and semi-parametric models to test the EKC for Louisiana in the U. S.  The parametric model showed turning points within $10,241–$12,993, $6636–$13,877 and $6467–$12,758 for nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and dissolved oxygen (DO), respectively.  Lindmark (2002) emphasized the need for further studies of the EKC from a historical perspective and consideration of the EKC framework as a special case of structural analyses for Sweden.  Similar theme and approach runs through the few Swedish studies on the EKC for CO2 and SO2 (Kriström, 2000.  Kander and Lindmark, 2004.  Kriström and Lundgren, 2005.  Johansson and Kriström, 2007).  Giving further impetus to the income distribution argument in the EKC, Brännlund and Ghalwash (2008) on the other hand analyzed the pollution and income nexus at the Swedish household level for CO2, SO2 and NOX.  All the Swedish cases pointed toward a conﬁrmation of the EKC hypothesis for the emissions considered.  Given the aggregated time series nature and focus of the above studies, there was no possibility to consider spatial effects in their estimations.  Despite exponential growth in the EKC literature, there is no uniform consensus from the empirics to conﬁrm the EKC stylized facts, at least for some emissions indicators.  Perman and Stern (2003) tested the EKC hypothesis on a panel data for sulfur emissions and GDP for 74 countries.  They ﬁnd sulfur emissions to be a convex function of income, casting doubt on the general applicability of the hypothesized nexus.  The conclusion was that the EKC is quite a problematic concept, at least for sulfur emissions. 2 Copeland and Taylor's (2004) statement summarizes the difﬁculties associated with the general applicability of the EKC, “…our review of both the theoretical and empirical literature work on the EKC leads us to be skeptical about the existence of a simple and predictable relationship between pollution and per capita income”.  Finally, the growing recognition of modelling the EKC for different emissions in both spatial and temporal contexts has led to the growth in a new strand of empirical work, at least over the last decade.  These studies typically look for and analyze spatial patterns or clusters in pollution data using GIS and spatial statistical tools.  Consequently, the EKC is then estimated via spatial error (SEM), spatial lag (SAR), spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAC/SARAR) or spatial Durbin (SDM) models using cross-sectional or panel data.  The idea of the spatial modelling framework is to relax the assumption of independence between cross-sections/geographic units (e. g.  locations) often invoked in non-spatial econometric models.  Rupasingha et al.  (2004) and Maddison (2006) were among a few to have motivated a shift from traditional EKC models to include spatial extensions.  They found signiﬁcant spatial correlation exist in many pollutants thus casting doubt on the reliability of non-spatial estimates.  Since these evidences, subsequent analysts have become more careful to at least test for spatial effects and modelled pollutants using variant spatial econometric models if signiﬁcant effects are found (see Burnett et al. , 2013a, 2013b.  Georgiev and Mihaylov, 2015.  Hao et al. , 2016.  Liu et al. , 2017).  Among more recent studies, Aklin (2016) examined the pollution (CO2 emissions) diffusion and trade nexus using a global database.  The pollution haven hypothesis was then tested with an EKC speciﬁcation where spatial effects was found to signiﬁcantly drive this phenomenon.  Our paper is situated within this class of studies.  <Middle> Methodology, estimation strategy and data.  3. 1.  Tests for spatial dependence.  As a ﬁrst step, we test for spatial autocorrelation in the individual emissions data.  We apply two tests - the classical global Moran's I3 and Geary's C(Moran, 1948.  Geary, 1954).  The two global measures of spatial dependence of a series are strongly linked, but the detection test based on Moran's I statistic is suggested to be more robust and powerful than the Geary's C (Dubé and Legros, 2014).  Anselin (1995) has shown that Moran's I statistic is more robust against the form of the spatial weight matrix utilized.  The tests are global in the sense that it is a spatial dependence measure that describes the overall spatial relationship across all municipalities.  Further, we undertake exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) to detect spatial regimes in the emissions data.  Localized version of Moran's I test for spatial autocorrelation, which measures the extent to which high and low values are clustered together is utilized.
