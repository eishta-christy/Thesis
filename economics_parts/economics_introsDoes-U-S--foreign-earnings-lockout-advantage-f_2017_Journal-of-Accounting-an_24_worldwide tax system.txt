 
Various business and political leaders in the United States have expressed concerns that the U. S.  system of taxing multinationals effectively subsidizes foreign takeovers ( White, 2014 ; Hatch, 2014 ).  Prior research on mergers and acquisitions 
(M&A) demonstrates how variation in tax rates ( Scholes and Wolfson, 1990, Arulampalam Name, 2010 ) and in tax systems 
( Huizinga and Voget, 2009 ; Feld Name, 2016 ) impact the market for corporate control.  As a result, ﬁrms under a worldwide 
tax system are tax-disadvantaged acquirers .  Furthering this line of inquiry, we posit that ﬁrms under a worldwide tax system 
are also tax-favored targets of foreign acquirers.  We ﬁnd that U. S.  ﬁrms with locked-out earnings are tax-favored to foreign 
acquirers (or equivalently tax-disfavored to U. S.  acquirers).  
Foreign earnings “lockout” results when ﬁrms avoid or delay foreign earnings repatriation.  Under the U. S.  worldwide tax 
system, taxes owing to the U. S.  government on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries are deferred until those earnings are 
repatriated to the U. S.  Consequently, ﬁrms’ repatriation decisions are sensitive to the level of repatriation taxes ( Desai et 
al. , 2001; Hines and Hubbard, 1990 ) and tax incentives lead to higher overseas cash holdings ( Foley Name, 2007 ).  Hanlon 
Name (2015) and Edwards Name (2016) demonstrate that ﬁrms use “trapped cash” to make suboptimal foreign investments, 
increasing total lockout.  A foreign acquirer may be able to free a target’s foreign subsidiaries’ locked-out earnings from the 
U. S.  worldwide tax system using “out-from-under” strategies, utilizing trapped cash elsewhere and liquidating suboptimal 
foreign investments so the proceeds may be more eﬃciently redeployed.  
To test this hypothesized relation between tax lockout in target U.
