 1.  Introduction The Transmission Network Expansion Planning Problem (TNEPP) is a classical problem in power electrical engineering and basically the problem consists in ﬁnding new transmission lines for an adequate operation over a planning horizon.  Traditionally, the problem was solved as a separate problem from the generation planning problem1, even though in the early days most electrical systems operated with a vertical structure and there was a central planner that somehow gave the conditions to coordinate the investment decisions in transmission and generation.  At the end of the 1970s competition was introduced in several electric utilities2.  In this competitive setting, no central planner is in charge of investments.  Instead, ﬁrst, generation companies decide their new capacity in function of their expected beneﬁts in the market.  Then, the transmission company decides the transmission capacity needed to transmit the energy from the new generators.  In mathematical terms, this interaction can be modeled by multilevel optimization problems.  In the specialized literature several multilevel models have been proposed.  an important remark is that the models implicitly assume that the opportunity cost of transmission capacity is determined by the price difference at the line endpoints 4.  This paper recognizes that the opportunity cost of transmission capacity not only depends on the difference of marginal costs at line endpoints, but also on the location of new generators.  Due to this, economic externalities arise when investment decisions are decentralized, so that the decentralized result does not lead to a Pareto optimal solution.  A good example of externalities in real power systems is the Peruvian case.  Before 2014, the Peruvian network consisted of two large areas (North and South) connected through a long transmission line (220 kV, 612 km).  The Southern area imports electricity from the North.  Moreover, the South has a large source of gas known as Camisea Gas and a gas pipeline was built in 2004 in order to deliver gas to the North.  After the entrance of the pipeline, many generation companies decided to invest in new capacity only in the North.  however, electricity demand in the South grew and no generation capacity was built there.  Due to this, a new transmission line (500 kV, 1000 km) between the North and South was placed in service in the year 2014.  Moreover, another line (500 kV, 1000 km) between the North and South is been constructed and will be placed in service by the year 2017.  Badly placed generators introduced negative externalities in the transmission planning.  Obviously, if generation companies had invested in the South, no transmission lines would have been needed.  In this context, we discuss how separating generation expansion from transmission planning can cause negative externalities to the transmission planning problem.  The organization of the paper is as follows.  in Section 2, we discuss how externalities can affect the TNEPP using a basic model.  in Section 3, we formulate a centralized multistage model for ﬁnding simultaneous optimal generation and transmission capacity.  The model is based on previous work of van der Weijde and Hobbs (2012) and O’Neill et al.  (2013).  The main purpose of the model is to show examples of externalities.  In Section 4, we present case studies for the 24-bus test system and the Peruvian system.  Finally, in Section 5 we present the conclusions of the article.  2.  A discussion about transmission capacity opportunity cost and externalities.  Some articles5 implicitly assume that the opportunity cost of transmission capacity is determined only by the price difference at the line endpoints.
