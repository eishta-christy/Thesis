 1.  Introduction The nexus between environmental quality (e. g.  pollution) and economic development has received much focus for many decades.  The main objective of this paper is to empirically investigate the pollution and income relationship across all Swedish municipalities from a spatial econometric perspective.  Our approach is motivated by recent but growing literature emphasizing the importance of the spatial dimension on this link and the implications of ignoring it (e. g.  Burnett et al. , 2013a, 2013b).  The emissions and income nexus is often modelled within the framework of the so-called environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, which posits an inverted U-shaped relationship between emissions and income, a curvature likely explained by technological progress and changes in preferences from income growth.  The EKC literature is replete with empirical modelling of different environmental quality indicators.  The evidence for many pollutants can however be best described as mixed.  Grossman and Krueger (1991, 1993, 1995) were among the ﬁrst authors to empirically examine the EKC hypothesis.  In their papers, Grossman and Krueger found the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between air quality (SO2 emission and “smoke”) and economic growth (per capita GDP).  The inverted U-shaped relationship implied that the two pollutants' concentration increased at lower per capita income levels but decreased with GDP growth at higher levels of income after a certain trajectory.  Selden and Song (1994) corroborated Grossman and Krueger (1991) after considering four air pollutants (suspended particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide) and per capita GDP1 relationship.  The EKC literature is associated with several criticisms (see Stern, 2004.  Kijima et al. , 2010.  Kaika and Zervas, 2013 for EKC survey).  Criticisms of the EKC have centered among others on poor econometric applications, limited single country studies using long historical time series data, lack of theoretical insights/foundation, neglect of leakage of dirty production from developed to developing countries (e. g.
