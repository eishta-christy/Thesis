There is an ongoing debate about the role of oil and gold in hedging
equity portfolios, which has become topical since the ﬁnancial crisis and
the subsequent ﬂuctuations in the prices of these assets.  In the literature, the role of oil and gold as hedges is not universally accepted, and
it seems to depend on geopolitical, economic, as well as other idiosyncratic factors.  This topic is of particular interest for oil-exporting countries, which are usually rich in these assets.  However, most of the
literature has focused on developed countries (Baur and McDermott,
2010; Hood and Malik, 2013; Choi and Hammoudeh, 2010; Creti Name,
2013; Ciner Name, 2013), while developing countries have only recently
started receiving further attention (Basher and Sadorsky, 2016).  Using
data from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries1 from January
2004 to May 2016, this paper employs a dynamic conditional correlation model (DCC-GARCH) to ﬁrst examine the shock transmissions
between the equity markets and the two commodities, and then
evaluate the hedging opportunities arising from including crude oil
and gold in equity portfolios.  Our paper is the ﬁrst to consider the
dynamic relationships between oil, gold and equities in the GCC countries, therefore further contributing to the debate. 
Examining the interconnectedness between oil, gold and equities is
of great importance for GCC countries, as they are net exporters of oil,
while they hold gold reserves to secure against US dollar ﬂuctuations,
which is the trading currency for both commodities.  At the same time,
GCC countries hold about 1. 3% of the world's gold reserves, hence our
study may also be of interest to local monetary authorities. 2 Finally,
given the absence of a derivatives market for GCC stocks, traditionally
used for hedging, it is important for GCC investors to ﬁnd alternative
risk management options. 
In light of the above, this paper examines the interconnectedness between the GCC exchanges and oil and gold, as well as the usefulness of
the two commodities in hedging GCC-based equity portfolios.  The
period considered, which spans from January 2004 to May 2016, is
rich in events, as it begins with the post-Iraqi war era, and covers the
ﬁnancial crisis, the historic peak of gold prices in 2010 and the
subsequent fall, as well as the recent oil crisis which began in June
2014.  During the ﬁnancial crisis, the price of oil fell signiﬁcantly, but
the rising price of gold balanced the negative effects of the crisis; in
fact, the GCC countries experienced signiﬁcant economic growth during
that period, despite the slowdown in the global economy.  The recent
crises in the gold and oil markets, though, led to a substantial revenue
slowdown for GCC oil exporters, while central bank reserves were also
affected negatively.  This adds to the on-going political turbulence in
the Middle East, which creates more investment uncertainty, and therefore makes the topic in hand an interesting case to examine. 
Our study contributes to the growing literature in energy ﬁnance,
that includes studies such as Arouri and Nguyen (2010), Baur and
McDermott (2010), Choi and Hammoudeh (2010), Filis Name (2011),
Arouri Name (2011), Awartani and Maghyereh (2013), Awartani Name
(2013), Ciner Name (2013), Creti Name (2013), Guesmi and Fattoum
(2014), Hoang Name (2015), Basher and Sadorsky (2016).  Most of
these studies examine the dynamic correlations between oil and equities, while only a few studies consider additional commodities, such as
Mensi Name (2013, 2015). 
We estimate return and volatility spillovers using the dynamic conditional correlation, general autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity
(DCC-GARCH) model of Engle (2002).  For the returns equation, we use
a VAR speciﬁcation that endogenously accounts for structural breaks,
while we follow the multivariate GARCH approach of Ling and McAleer
(2003) to model volatility.  The DCCs between GCC equities and the
two commodities are then used to compute dynamic hedge ratios and
portfolio weights. 
Our results reveal signiﬁcant return and volatility transmissions
from oil to equities, highlighting the link between oil production and
corporate cash ﬂows in GCC economies, whereas the inﬂuence of gold
on equities appears insigniﬁcant and negligible.  In the opposite direction, we do not ﬁnd convincing evidence that the GCC stock markets
can inﬂuence the two commodity markets, which we attribute to the
relatively small capitalisation of the exchanges.  Our analysis of dynamic
correlations and dynamic hedge ratios indicates that, although the two
commodities are cheap hedges, and in contrast to previous studies, they
cannot be considered as good ones due to their weak dynamic correlations with equities.  We therefore conclude that oil and gold can instead
be used for portfolio diversiﬁcation, which is an important result for
GCC equity holders, given that the local exchanges list relatively few
corporations from a narrow selection of sectors. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a
contextual background about the GCC stock markets; Section 3 reviews
the relevant literature; Section 3 analyses the empirical methods
followed; Section 4 presents the data used in this study; Section 5
discusses the empirical ﬁndings, while Section 5 concludes the paper. 
2.  The GCC stock markets. 
The GCC was established on 11 November 1981, and it includes six
countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. 
GCC countries are important players in the global oil market, as that
they possess 47% of veriﬁed oil reserves and they produce 23. 7% of
crude oil.  Saudi Arabia is the second largest crude oil producer in the
world, producing on average 13% of crude oil.  The contributions for
the rest GCC countries are 3. 6% for Kuwait, 1. 3% for Oman, 1. 9% for
Qatar, and 3. 9% for UAE.  Bahrain is the smallest producer with an average output of 50 thousand barrels a day (0. 06%). 3 As reported in Table 1,
oil revenues contribute signiﬁcantly to the economic and business
p. 162).  Note that the maximum foreign ownership in an Omani can range up to 100% in
the free zones.  Foreign ownership in certain countries, such as Saudi Arabia, is restricted
to GCC nationals. 
activities of the region, as they range from 15% of GDP in Bahrain to
53% of GDP in Kuwait.  Table 1 also shows that one of the main contributions of oil is through the trade balance, since fuel exports account from
42. 5% of total merchandise value in UAE up to 89. 1% in Kuwait. 
These indicators suggest that corporate cash ﬂows and economic
output can be very sensitive to oil price ﬂuctuations.  Moreover, companies which are directly related to oil production, occupy a considerable
proportion of the total capitalisation of the equity indices of the GCC
stock exchanges, with the exception of the Kuwaiti market which is
dominated by ﬁnancial services.  However, oil and gas in the bloc are
produced by national companies and therefore the proportion of the energy sector that is represented in stock exchanges is not necessarily
high.  For instance, Saudi Arabia lists only four traded companies
which comprise b2% of the total traded capital in the market. 4
Corporate cash ﬂows can be also indirectly related to oil price ﬂuctuations, given the heavy dependence of the region on oil.  Khandelwal
Name (2016) explain that this dependence may be channelled through
the supply chain for companies for which oil comprises a signiﬁcant
proportion of their variable costs, or through the close links of ﬁnancial
services with the oil industry in the region.  Moreover, given that oil
revenues are the main source of government funding,5 ﬁscal spending,
which in turn is channelled to a great extent to the private sector,
effectively depends on oil ﬂuctuations. 
Saudi Arabia is the leading exchange in the bloc in terms of size,
years of operation and liquidity, as implied by the turnover ratio
(Table 1).  The smallest and least liquid market is Bahrain, while the
Omani stock market is also relatively illiquid.  Moreover, compared to
other major emerging markets, GCC exchanges are small and less liquid,
while their capitalisation accounts for 0. 8% of global capitalization. 
Despite the recent modernisation efforts, GCC stock markets suffer
from several structural and regulatory deﬁciencies, which, combined
with the political uncertainty in the area, create a challenging corporate
environment.  GCC markets are segmented with signiﬁcant restrictions
on capital mobility and foreign ownership (Table 1), especially when
compared to other developed and emerging economies.  Moreover,
there are structural weaknesses in supervision, corporate governance,
and reporting standards, creating issues in terms of the transparency
and reliability of information.  In addition to this, the participation of institutional investors is relatively small, which has been argued to be a
contributing factor to noise trading.  Finally, the number of listed companies and sectors is small, limiting the breadth of options for diversiﬁcation (sector breadth). 
3.  Literature review. 
The literature on the links between oil, gold and equities is rich and
offers various interpretations about the shock transmission mechanisms
between these assets.  Oil prices have been shown to have predictive
power for stocks, especially in developed countries (Driesprong Name,
2008), while they are commonly cited in the literature to adversely inﬂuence stock prices.  Oil price ﬂuctuations alter production costs (Arouri
and Nguyen, 2010), and they therefore affect corporate cash ﬂows and
ﬁrm proﬁtability, which is then reﬂected on stock prices (Jones and
Kaul, 1996).  Indirect effects are also important as oil prices traditionally
correlate negatively with real economic activity (Mork Name, 1994),
while empirical evidence seems to support this claim (Nandha and
Faff, 2008). 6 For example, increasing oil prices can reduce disposable income, increase precautionary savings, and, therefore, reduce consumption demand overall (Edelstein and Kilian, 2009).  At the same time,
due to the fact that oil and capital are complements, the rising production costs can also lead to reduced output and cost-push inﬂation
(Berndt and Wood, 1979).  In addition, oil price volatility can introduce
uncertainty in all sectors of the economy (Ferderer, 1996), negatively affecting ﬁrm investments (Henriques and Sadorsky, 2011).  Finally, reallocation effects can also explain the negative correlation between the two
assets, as capital and labour may migrate to sectors that are less exposed
to a crisis (Hamilton, 1988).  In fact, the indirect effects can be severe if
the economy depends heavily on oil, as Khandelwal Name (2016) show
for GCC countries.  However, oil prices can be also driven by aggregate demand factors during the expansion phase of the business cycle, and
therefore a positive association may be observed with stock prices as
ﬁrms enjoy greater proﬁtability and growth (Park and Ratti, 2008). 7
The nature of the relationship of equities with gold is quite different
compared to oil, as gold is a competing asset for stocks, given that a
fraction of total demand for gold relates to investment.  Gold, being a
precious metal, is a store of value, therefore serving as a hedge against
inﬂation (Jastram, 1977; Jaffe, 1989; Ghosh Name, 2004).  In fact, in the
presence of structural breaks, the role of gold as an inﬂation hedge
appears more signiﬁcant (Worthington and Pahlavani, 2007).  However,
Hoang Name (2016) ﬁnd that gold is an inﬂation hedge in the short run
for the UK, USA and India, but not for China, Japan and France. 8 Gold has
been also thought traditionally to serve as a hedge against stock price
ﬂuctuations during crisis periods (that is, a safe haven), a ﬁnding
which is mostly conﬁrmed for developed countries.  Baur and
McDermott (2010) investigate this relationship from 1979 to 2009
and ﬁnd that gold is both a hedge and a safe haven for European and
with the US dollar, but not for Australia, Canada, Japan and BRICS countries.  Chua Name (1990) and Baur and Lucey (2010) provide further
supporting evidence on the safe haven status of gold.  Hood and Malik
(2013), on the contrary, ﬁnd evidence that gold can serve as a hedge
in the US stock market, but its performance as a safe haven is weak. 9
Oil and gold are also cited to be positively correlated, as they are both
traded in US dollars.  In particular, a falling dollar would lead to an
increase in the nominal dollar price of oil and gold (to maintain their
real value), which has been conﬁrmed by Capie Name (2005) and
Reboredo (2013b) for gold.  Zhang and Wei (2010) and Reboredo
(2013a) ﬁnd a positive link between the two commodities which they
attribute to their common dependency with the US dollar; however,
Reboredo (2013a) also ﬁnds that gold can act as a safe haven against
oil price ﬂuctuations.  Hammoudeh and Yuan (2008), ﬁnd that past
positive oil shocks tend to reduce current gold volatility, therefore having a calming effect on gold, which appears signiﬁcant in oil producing
countries. 
Apart from the return and volatility spillovers between oil, gold and
equities, the literature has also examined dynamic correlations and
hedging opportunities.  Filis Name (2011), consider both oil-importing
and oil-exporting countries and ﬁnd that dynamic correlations between
oil and equities increase with demand-side shocks, while they do not
ﬁnd evidence that oil can serve as a safe haven.  Choi and Hammoudeh
(2010), who examine the dynamic correlations between Brent oil,
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil, copper, gold, silver and the S&P
500 index, ﬁnd increasing correlations between WTI oil and gold since
2003, but decreasing correlations between S&P 500 returns and all commodities.  Creti Name (2013) ﬁnd increasing, and more volatile dynamic
correlations between the S&P 500 returns and 25 commodities after
the ﬁnancial crisis, except for gold, which appears negatively correlated
with the stock market.  Ciner Name (2013), who focus on stocks, bonds,
gold, oil and exchange rates in the US and the UK during the period
1990 to 2010, ﬁnd weak dependency between oil and stocks, with the
exception of crisis periods, where this relationship becomes negative. 
They also ﬁnd a weak relationship between gold and stocks, which
they attribute to the increasing instrumentation of gold through
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), and, hence, the re-evaluation of the
role of gold as a safe haven by investors. 
The studies which are closest to ours are by Mensi Name (2015) and
Basher and Sadorsky (2016).  Mensi Name (2015) ﬁnd a positive association between Saudi equities and oil, and a negative association with
gold; however, only tail dependence is considered, rather than
dynamic correlations and volatility transmissions across GCC markets. 
Basher and Sadorsky (2016) examine the links between oil and gold
9 We would like to thank one of the anonymous reviewers who indicated that, due to
the small capitalization of the GCC countries, it would be unlikely to evidence signiﬁcant
spillovers from equities to gold.  Indeed, there is little or non-existing evidence in the literature that stock market ﬂuctuations could have an impact on the gold market, especially if
the focus is on small exchanges, such as in GCC countries.  Two exceptions that we found
concern large exchanges.  For example, Miyazaki and Hamori (2013) observe return spillovers from US stocks to gold after the ﬁnancial crisis, which they describe as a “ﬂight-toquality” effect.  Similar results are reported by Choudry Name (2015) who applied nonlinear
causality tests to the UK, US and Japanese stock exchanges and found bidirectional causality in returns and volatility between equities and gold.  However, it is also interesting to
note that Bekaert Name (2014) show that the country origin of the ﬁnancial crisis did not
play an important role in the contagion of the crisis to other countries.  Instead, they found
evidence in support of the “wake-up call” hypothesis, according to which crises induce investors to reconsider their investment positions and risk exposures, even in the absence of
trade and banking links.  The implication is that, even though GCC countries hold a small
fraction of global stock capitalisation, it would be unwise to exclude the possibility of contagion to other markets, originating from GCC. 
and emerging country equities, represented by the MSCI emerging market index. 10 Their results indicate that oil is the best asset to hedge
emerging market stock prices. 11 However, no safe conclusions can be
drawn about individual countries in the area due to aggregation in to
a single market index.  In light of the above, there is a gap in the literature in examining the dynamic correlations and dynamic hedge ratios
between oil, gold and equities of GCC countries. 
<Middle> Methodology. 
This section presents the modelling approach used in our paper.  We
ﬁrst provide details about the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC)
GARCH model that estimates volatility spillovers and conditional correlations, which we use to examine for interdependencies among GCC
stock markets, oil and gold.  Then, we show how hedge ratios and optimal weights can be calculated for two-asset portfolios, using the results
from DCC-GARCH. 
Since the seminal works of Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1986), there
is a voluminous literature that models the volatility of univariate
ﬁnancial time series with the (G)ARCH family of models.  To account
for interlinkages and spillovers between ﬁnancial assets or markets,
multivariate GARCH models have been proposed, where the conditional
mean equation is modelled through a vector autoregressive (VAR) process and the covariance matrix has a dynamic structure.  The challenge
with MGARCH lies in modelling the time-varying conditional covariance matrix and therefore various parametrisations have been
proposed.  In the generalized VEC formulation, outlined in Bollerslev
Name (1988), the conditional volatility is parametrized as a linear
function of lagged squared errors and cross products of errors and
lagged values of conditional variances.  To guarantee positive deﬁniteness of the covariance matrix, Engle and Kroner (1995) propose the
BEKK model which is a special case of the VEC model.  The difﬁculty
with these models lies in the large number of parameters to be estimated even after the imposition of restrictions, explaining why these
models are rarely used when the number of series exceeds three.  Factor
models, proposed by Engle Name (1990) and Bollerslev and Engle
(1993), have been employed to circumvent this difﬁculty, though by
assuming the same dynamic structure on all the elements of the conditional variance matrix, hence reducing the number of estimated
parameters. 
Another group of models that is useful in the context of information
transmission is the conditional correlation models.  The individual conditional variance in these models is ﬁrst estimated and then the
conditional correlation matrix is built on the basis of the chosen speciﬁcation.  The constant conditional correlation model of Bollerslev (1990),
known as CCC-GARCH, assumes that the conditional correlations are
time invariant.  The DCC-GARCH by Engle (2002) is an extension that
allows for the conditional correlation matrix to be time-varying and
therefore allows for past innovations in one market to inﬂuence the
conditional volatility in other markets. 12
In this paper, we estimate volatility transmission and dynamic
correlations using a DCC-GARCH (1,1) speciﬁcation.  For the returns
equation, we use a VAR model that endogenously accounts for structural breaks, while we follow the multivariate GARCH approach of Ling and
McAleer (2003) in modelling the volatility equation, the difference of
which with the model of Engle (2002) is explained below.  This multivariate GARCH speciﬁcations with dynamic conditional correlation
framework allows us to model the (conditional) volatility dynamics
and conditional correlations between GCC equities and the two
commodities. 
The DCCs between GCC equities and the two commodities are
subsequently used to compute the dynamic hedge ratios and the
optimal portfolio weights.  This approach is applied by, among others,
Sadorsky (2012, 2014) and Basher and Sadorsky (2016) to study the
volatility dynamics between emerging market stock prices and
commodity prices, and appears to be ﬂexible and efﬁcient in studying
time-varying correlations and volatility spillover effects. 
Let rt be a k×1 vector containing the returns at time t on.  The conditional mean equation is speciﬁed by the following
k=3 assets, and in particular the stock market, crude oil,
where c=(cs,co,cg)′ is a k× 1 vector of constant terms; Ψ and Ξ are
time-invariant k×k matrices of coefﬁcients with elements,
dently and identically distributed errors.  From the above speciﬁcation,
testing for return spillovers is equivalent to testing ψij=0, ∀i≠j. 
In the volatility speciﬁcation, Ht is a symmetric k×k conditional
variance-covariance matrix, which includes the time-varying conditional
volatilities on the main diagonal, [Ht]i=j=hii,t, and the time-varying conditional covariances on the off-diagonal elements, [Ht]i≠j=hij,t.  Following
Engle (2002), Ht can be written as Ht=DtRtDt, where Dt ¼ diagf
is a diagonal k×k matrix of time-varying conditional volatilities, Rt is a
symmetric k×k matrix of time-varying conditional correlations with
elements [Rt]ij=ρij,t, so that hij. 
We follow Ling and McAleer (2003) and obtain the elements of Dt
from a multivariate GARCH speciﬁcation.  Their approach to modelling
the conditional variances allows for measuring the volatility spillovers
between assets.  Deﬁne as ht the vector of conditional volatilities included in the principal diagonal of Ht.  The conditional variances are speciﬁed
as follows,
where γ=(γs,γo,γg) is a k ×1 vector of constant terms; A and B are
k×k matrices of estimated ARCH and GARCH coefﬁcients, respectively,
with elements [A]ij=αij,[B]ij=βij, where i,j={s,o,g}. 13 For i=j, αij represent own conditional ARCH effects which measure short-term persistence, whereas βij represent own GARCH effects which measure longterm persistence or volatility clustering.  The mean reverting condition,
0 bαij+βijb1, for i=j is required to ensure that a long run equilibrium
in conditional volatility is established.  For i≠j, the αij and βij coefﬁcients
capture volatility spillovers between assets.  In particular, αij measures
the shock spillovers from asset j on the conditional volatility of asset i,
while βij measures past volatility spillovers from asset j on the conditional volatility of asset i. 
Given the conditional variances in Eq.  (2), the time-varying conditional correlation matrix Rt in the DCC model takes the following form,
where Qt is a k×k symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix, given by,
where Q is the unconditional covariance matrix of the standardized
residuals εt, θ1and θ2 are nonnegative scalar coefﬁcients with a sum of
less than unity that account for past inﬂuences on the current conditional covariances, while the elements of [Qt]ij=qij,t can be interpreted as
the dynamic conditional covariances between assets i and j.  The
parameters of the DCC model are obtained using the quasi-maximum
likelihood (QML) algorithm of Bollerslev and Wooldridge (1992). 14
The conditional correlation coefﬁcient ρij,t can be then computed. 
The conditional volatility estimates are then used to compute
optimal hedge ratios, which can be considered as the proportion of risk
of asset i that can be hedged away by taking a short position in instrument (asset) j, while minimising the variance of the formed portfolio. 15
Following Kroner and Sultan (1993), the hedge ratio between asset i
(long position) and asset j (short position), can be computed. 
To obtain dynamic hedge ratios, we follow Sadorsky (2012, 2014) and
Basher and Sadorsky (2016) who employ a rolling window analysis with
out-of-sample forecasts.  The hedge ratios are commonly interpreted as
the dollar amount of the short position that needs to be taken in the
hedge to cover one dollar of the short position in the asset under consideration.  Hence, an instrument is a cheap hedge for another asset when the
associated hedge ratio is close to zero. 17 Following the deﬁnitions in Baur
and McDermott (2010), we also characterise an asset as a strong (weak)
hedge, if it is negatively correlated (uncorrelated) with another asset. 
Similarly, the status of strong (weak) safe haven can be given to an asset
when negative (low) correlations are observed only during ﬁnancial
crises.  We therefore deﬁne an instrument as a good hedge, if is both a
cheap and strong hedge, while a bad hedge is an instrument that is an
expensive and weak hedge. 
Similarly, the conditional volatilities from the model can be used to
construct optimal portfolio weights as in Kroner and Ng (1998),
while the weight of asset j in is computed as 1−wij,t
is the weight of asset i in a one-dollar portfolio at time t,
5.  Data description and preliminary statistics. 
We use daily data on GCC stock market indices, Brent crude oil prices
(dollars per barrel) and gold prices (dollars per ounce) from 2nd
January 2004 to 31st May 2016, obtained from Thomson Reuters. 
Datastream (a total of 3239 daily observations).  Daily returns are used
to capture the short-lived effects of volatility spillovers which would
otherwise appear weak in longer horizons (Kim Name, 2005). 18 Daily
frequency is therefore more suitable for estimating volatility spillovers
(Mensi Name, 2015), while it is often preferred in similar recent studies
(Mollick and Assefa, 2013; Nazlioglu Name, 2013; Basher and Sadorsky,
2016).  Stock returns are calculated using the log ratio of the closing
prices as rt=ln(pt/pt−1). 
Fig.  1 presents the price-return plots for oil, gold and the GCC stock
indices.  The primary axes correspond to the price levels and the
secondary axes to returns, while the titles above each graph are selfexplanatory.  We observe that all assets have an increasing trend during
the ﬁrst year of the study, reaching a peak in 2007, after which a sharp
decline is observed as the effects of the ﬁnancial crisis have started
showing up.  Apart from the fast declining oil and stock prices, volatility
was also high during that period as can be seen from the returns graph. 
However, Saudi Arabia had just exited a stock exchange crisis in 2006
and the negative effects were moderate during the ﬁnancial crisis
compared to the other GCC countries. 
After 2009 a tranquil period follows which is interrupted by the recent decline in oil prices, accompanied by high volatility in oil returns
indicating strong asymmetry, which was also manifested across the
GCC stock exchanges to a varying degree.  The momentum of gold prices
is maintained throughout the ﬁnancial crisis, consistent with the view
that gold can serve as a safe haven in volatile periods.  The continuous
price increase of gold stops in 2011, while a moderate leverage effect
is also observed.  The volatility spike in 2013, when the price of gold
sharply declined in one week, does not link to any abnormal price
variation in oil or equities, though.  The oil crisis has been reﬂected in
stock price variations to varying degrees in the GCC stock exchanges,
though this is not true for gold. 
The descriptive statistics of the return series for the stock indices and
the two commodities are presented in Table 2.  Gold exhibits the highest
average daily returns of 0. 032%, while oil is the riskiest asset in terms of
standard deviation.  The risk and return relationships seems to differ
across exchanges and commodities, indicating the varying degrees of
relative risk and indicating a potential for risk reduction by combining
the various assets in portfolios.  All asset returns are non-normal and
have shapes which differ to some extent.  It seems, though, that the
returns for all assets have negative skewness with the exception of oil
returns that do not seem to be skewed.  An interesting observation is
that the Qatari stock exchange exhibits positive skewness, which
suggests a considerably different behaviour than the neighbouring exchanges.  Moreover, the fact that all distributions are leptokurtic, with
the exception of oil (3. 550), indicates that the distributions have fat
tails, pointing to the existence of conditional heteroscedasticity.  The
table also reports the Ljung–Box portmanteau statistic for a 20-day
period and we ﬁnd evidence of serial correlation for all assets. 
Table 2 also reports the correlation coefﬁcients for each exchange
with oil and gold, as well as the correlation coefﬁcient between the
two commodities.  The low correlation, on average, between stock
exchange returns and the commodities implies that hedging opportunities may be limited, though diversiﬁcation opportunities may be available during certain times.  However, the simple correlation analysis
cannot be safely utilised, given the time varying nature of volatilities
and covariances of asset returns, which is dealt with in the next section. 
In order to test for structural breaks we conduct a unit root test that
accounts for multiple breaks in the series as in Lee and Strazicich (2003)
and Lee Name (2012), and report our ﬁndings in Table 3.  We ﬁnd breaks
for the stock exchanges and oil around the peak of the international ﬁnancial crisis in the end of 2008, with the exception of Saudi Arabia
which lags behind by a quarter, presumably due the fact that Saudi
Arabia had just exited another ﬁnancial crisis.  On the contrary, the
structural break for gold is manifested in late September 2011, which
coincides with the reversal of the price momentum of gold, which
ended up in a steady decline of its price until the beginning of 2016.  Although it is difﬁcult to pin down the underlying causes of this reversal,
as gold has no well-deﬁned fundamental value, it could be speculated
that this is related to the declining uncertainty in ﬁnancial markets as
the effects of the ﬁnancial crisis had been fading away.  Moreover, the reversal coincides with the gold sell-out by the Central Bank of Cyprus to
deal with its ﬁnancial crisis, the bearish Goldman-Sachs prediction of
the gold prices, and the algorithmic trading against gold by many commodity ETFs.  These primary observations are indications that oil and
GCC equities react to similar events whereas gold does not follow
these patterns. 
6.  Empirical results. 
This section discusses the empirical results of our study.  We ﬁrst
present the results from the DCC-GARCH models and then we compute
hedge ratios and optimal weights resulting from including oil and gold
in the GCC equity portfolios. 
6. 1.  Return and volatility spillovers. 
The results of the multivariate DCC-GARCH model for all GCC countries are presented in Table 4 below.  Panel A reveals moderate, though
signiﬁcant, positive autocorrelations for all indices (ψss), positive but insigniﬁcant autocorrelations for oil (ψoo), with two exceptions at the 10%
level, while for gold the inﬂuence of past returns seem to have a negative but insigniﬁcant effect on current returns (ψgg).  As expected, oil
returns have positive spillovers on stock indices (ψso), supporting the
view that corporate cash ﬂows are directly or indirectly affected by oil
prices (Jones and Kaul, 1996; Arouri and Nguyen, 2010).  Moreover,
the effect of past gold returns on current stock returns appear marginally negative, though insigniﬁcant, indicating that investors do not necessarily consider gold price ﬂuctuations when investing on GCC equities. 
In the opposite direction, we found insigniﬁcant spillovers of past
stock returns on the returns of oil (ψos) and gold (ψgs).  This suggests
that past ﬁnancial shocks in the GCC stock markets do not inﬂuence
the investment behaviour of commodity traders, which can be justiﬁed
by the relatively small proportion of GCC stock markets in the global
capitalisation (0. 8% for all indices). 
Considering the relationship between the two commodities, we ﬁnd
signiﬁcant return spillovers in both directions, which is attributed in the
literature to their common dependence on the US dollar (Capie Name,
2005; Reboredo, 2013b; Zhang and Wei, 2010).  A surprising ﬁnding is
that, although the effect of past oil returns on gold (ψgo) is positive
and signiﬁcant, the sign is negative in the opposite direction (ψog). 
One possible explanation is that gold has served as a hedge against inﬂation and as a safe haven for developed countries during the ﬁnancial crisis (Baur and McDermott, 2010; Hoang Name, 2016).  Moreover, the halt
in momentum of gold price was not necessarily related to the oil market, and therefore the estimated parameters ψgo and ψog may have
been picking up different impacts.  Our structural break tests provide
support for the latter explanation, as the break in oil returns had no signiﬁcant impact on gold (ξgo), whereas the structural break for gold,
apart from the negative effects on its own returns (ξgg), had also had a
negative and signiﬁcant inﬂuence on oil returns (ξog), implying a change
in the relationship between the two assets. 
Regarding other structural breaks, we ﬁnd that the ﬁnancial crisis
has had a signiﬁcant negative impact on stock returns (ξss), but a
signiﬁcant positive impact on oil returns (ξoo), indicating that there
may be hedging opportunities for investors.
