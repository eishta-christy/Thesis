Environmentally extended input-output analysis has been widely
used to estimate production- and consumption-based emissions in
many countries (Peters, 2008.  Hertwich and Peters, 2009.  IPCC, 2014),
and in Japan a national emission inventory has been provided to the
public every ﬁve years (NIES, 2016).  A major advantage of using environmental energy input-output analysis is that product supply-chain
networks can be easily modelled and environmentally and ecologically
important sectors and paths can be identiﬁed from the network
