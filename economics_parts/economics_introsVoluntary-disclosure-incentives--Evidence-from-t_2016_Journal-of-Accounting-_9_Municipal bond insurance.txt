Limited regulatory oversight and weak public ﬁnancial disclosure in the municipal bond market provide a novel context
for studying the conﬂicting roles of market and political forces in driving disclosure decisions.  From a market perspective,
low borrowing costs minimize resources consumed by interest payments and maximize resources that can be devoted to
political priorities.  Therefore, municipal ofﬁcials are incented to use disclosure to reduce the cost of capital, to the extent the
beneﬁt exceeds the cost of publishing and disseminating the information.  From a political perspective, municipal ofﬁcials
operate under a democratic system in which voters rely on the limited information available to them to make electoral
decisions.  Therefore, reputational damage from disclosing negative information to voters may inhibit disclosure. 
To better understand the trade-off between minimizing the cost of capital through transparency, minimizing expected
reputational costs by suppressing negative information, and minimizing administrative costs, I identify several events that
alter the cost-beneﬁt tradeoff.  Because these events affect only a subset of municipal bond issues, unaffected issues create a
natural control group. 
First, I identify a ubiquitous, externally imposed escalation of credit risk: the abatement of municipal bond insurance. 
Municipal bond insurance was historically prevalent in the municipal bond market because it reduces the cost of capital for
issuers.  During the ﬁnancial crisis, municipal bond insurers suffered large losses related to subprime mortgage exposure,
leading to credit downgrades for all of the bond insurers.
