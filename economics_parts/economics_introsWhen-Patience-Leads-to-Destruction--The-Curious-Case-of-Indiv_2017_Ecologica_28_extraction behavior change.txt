 1.  Introduction Destructive ﬁshing is considered to be one of the most important problems in marine governance (Clark et al. , 2005.  Sethi et al. , 2005).  According to the United Nations Environment Program, about 25% of ﬁsheries worldwide are in jeopardy of collapse due to destructive ﬁshing (Shakouri et al. , 2010).  The threat of destructive ﬁshing, such as the use of poison, dynamite and illegal nets, is especially devastating for inshore ﬁsheries in tropical and developing countries where small communities are engaged in subsistence ﬁshing (Belton and Thilsted, 2014).  The collapse or even serious degradation of local ﬁsheries due to the use of destructive ﬁshing gears has a very negative impact on the material well-being of these communities.  As a result, there have been frequent attempts to persuade ﬁshers who are using destructive gears to change their behavior, and switch to more environmentallyfriendly ﬁshing gears (Samoilys et al. , 2008).  In most cases this involves policy measures, such as gear-exchange programs or monetary incentives for resource conservation (Verheij et al. , 2004).  These policies are motivated by the assumption that a major motivation for using destructive ﬁshing gear is impatience or short-sightedness (low discount factors) and the lack of availability of high capital stocks.  This assumption is based on standard economic models of renewable resources, going back to Hotelling (1931), which frame natural resource extraction as an intertemporal optimization problem, where discount factors1 indicate the value given to expected future consumption.  This implies that, higher discount factors meaning higher valuation of expected future consumption, leads to lower rates of extraction and vice versa.  Following Farzin (1984) we refer to this as the conservation effect.  However Farzin (1984) offers a different point of view and argues that, for high cost of extraction, the relationship between discount factors and resource extraction is opposite to the generally held one, meaning that higher discount factors result in higher extraction levels and vice versa.  This is based on the view, that, patient ﬁshers are able to invest more in their extraction capabilities.  We refer to this as the disinvestment effect.  We add to this discussion by applying the underlying logic of these models to the speciﬁc context of the adoption of destructive ﬁshing gears in small-scale artisanal ﬁsheries.  Our main objective is to distinguish between scenarios where the policies based on the conservation effect are justiﬁed and the conditions under which they are not justiﬁed.  Typical policies, like livelihood diversiﬁcation or temporal closures with income compensation, may lead to undesirable effects in a situation when the disinvestment effect dominates the conservation effect.  We contribute to solving this conundrum, by providing a better understanding of ﬁsher's motivation to adopt destructive gears and its relationship to individual time preferences.  This research question is motivated by empirical research in Zanzibar which suggests that patient ﬁshermen have higher extraction level since they can invest more in their extraction capability (see Javaid et al. , 2016).  This surprising ﬁnding triggered some interesting and unanswered questions.  Does the relationship between time preferences and extraction behavior change depending on the circumstances.  What role do external factors play in this decision-making.
