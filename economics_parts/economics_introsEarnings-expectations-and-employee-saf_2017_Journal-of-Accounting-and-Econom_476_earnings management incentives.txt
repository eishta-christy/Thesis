Introduction Accounting research has long shown that managers face pressure to meet earnings benchmarks and that they react to this pressure by manipulating accruals and real activities when their firm is at risk of missing benchmarks (e. g. , Dechow et al.  2010, §5. 5).  Survey evidence suggests that, in order to meet benchmarks, managers prefer taking real actions over manipulating accruals (Graham et al. , 2005).  Empirical studies provide strong evidence for real activities management (e. g.  Roychowdhury, 2006.  Cohen et al. , 2008).  Importantly, real activities management is difficult for investors to detect in the short run (Kothari et al. , 2016) but potentially has negative consequences for firms’ long-run performance (e. g. , Bhojraj et al. , 2009.  Cohen and Zarowin, 2010).  In this study, we provide evidence of a previously undocumented consequence of real activities management to meet earnings benchmarks – compromises in workplace safety.  In particular, we show that benchmark beating is associated with higher workplace injuries and that the strength of this association varies with employee workloads and discretionary expenses that include safety-related expenditures.  Earnings benchmarks can relate to workplace safety in at least two ways.  First, if managers believe that the firm may miss expectations under the ordinary course of business, they may increase employees’ workloads or pressure them to work faster.  In response, employees can compromise safety by overexerting themselves or by circumventing safety procedures that slow the flow of work.  Second, managers may cut explicit and implicit safety costs, such as the costs of maintaining equipment and training employees, in their attempts to report higher earnings.  Along these lines, Graham et al.  (2005) report that some CFOs admit to cutting maintenance spending in order to meet earnings benchmarks.  To the extent managers take such actions, workplace safety will deteriorate when firms struggle to meet expectations.  We examine whether firms suspected of managing earnings to meet expectations exhibit higher workplace injury rates than other firms.  We follow prior research on earnings management and define firms that meet or just beat expectations as suspect firms (e. g. , Burgstahler and Dichev, 1997.  Degeorge et al. , 1999).  Using establishment-level (e. g. , store or factory) injury data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for the 2002–2011 period, we find that about one in every 24 employees is injured in firms that meet or just beat analyst earnings forecasts, compared to about one in 27 in firms that miss or comfortably beat forecasts.  In multivariate analyses, where we control for a variety of establishmentand firm-level characteristics as well as establishment (or firm) and year fixed effects to account for unobservable factors, we find that the association between benchmark beating and injury rates remains statistically and economically significant.  For example, controlling for other factors, injury rates are five to fifteen percent higher in periods where a firm meets or just beats analyst forecasts than in other periods.  We provide evidence that the relation between benchmark beating and workplace safety likely stems from two types of real actions that managers take.  high workloads and cuts to safety-related expenditures.  We utilize production per employee and revenue per employee as measures of employee workloads, and abnormal discretionary expenses per employee to gauge cuts to safety-related expenditures.  We find that injury rates are more strongly associated with production per employee in firms that meet or just beat forecasts.  We also find evidence that injury rates are higher when firms that meet or just beat forecasts have abnormally low per-employee discretionary expenditures. 1 Taken together, the evidence suggests that both pressure to increase worker productivity and cuts to safety-related expenditures contribute to the relation between benchmark beating and workplace safety.  We use three settings to examine cross-sectional variation in the relation between benchmark beating and workplace safety.  First, we find that the relation is weaker in industries with high union membership.  This is consistent with unions’ aim to ensure reasonable workloads, work speed, and safety (Kaufman, 2005).  It is also consistent with the findings in the literature that, compared to non-union workers, union workers are less likely to perceive that taking risks is a part of their job (Gillen et al. , 2002), and unionization leads to fewer workplace injuries (Morantz, 2013).  Consistent with unions’ goal of workplace safety, our evidence suggests that unions mitigate the extent to which pressure to meet earnings expectations translates into reduced safety.  Second, we find a weaker relation between benchmark beating and workplace safety when workers’ compensation insurance premiums are more sensitive to injury claims.  Workers’ compensation insurance is a state-mandated program and its premiums are primarily determined by state requirements.  Insurance premiums depend, in part, on a multiplier based on the employer's workplace safety record.  A given change in the multiplier thus has a greater dollar impact on premiums when the baseline insurance premium is higher.  We test and find that the association between benchmark beating and workplace safety is weaker in establishments that are located in states where each additional injury has a higher impact on workers’ compensation premium.  Third, we utilize government contracting as an incentive for keeping safer work environments.  Government contracts typically include terms that prohibit bids from firms deemed to have unsafe work environments.  Consistent with the government contractors’ heightened focus on safety, we find that the relation between benchmark beating and workplace safety is weaker for firms that do more business with the government.  In our main analyses, we focus on analyst forecasts as our measure of earnings expectations since prior research indicates that meeting analyst forecasts is a more important benchmark than meeting prior year's earnings or avoiding losses (Dechow et al. , 2003), and that the market perceives missing analyst forecasts as a more negative signal than a decrease in yearover-year earnings (Brown and Caylor, 2005).  In additional tests, we replicate our primary analyses for the zero-earnings and zero-earnings-change benchmarks.  We find higher injury rates in suspect firm-years identified by zero-earningschanges, but not for zero-earnings.  This may be because after the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002, the zeroearnings discontinuity, and to a lesser extent discontinuity around prior year's earnings, have dissipated whereas the discontinuity around analyst forecasts remain (Gilliam et al. , 2015).  Our study is related to the literature studying the forms and consequences of earnings management via real activities.  Extant research finds that managers cut research and development (e. g. , Baber et al. , 1991), advertising (e. g. , Cohen et al. , 2010), selling, administrative and general expenditures, and engage in over-production (e. g. , Roychowdhury, 2006) in order to meet earnings benchmarks, and that such activities potentially negatively affect a firm's long-run operating performance (e. g. , Bhojraj et al. , 2009.  Cohen and Zarowin, 2010).  Our study adds to this literature by documenting a novel and potentially opaque consequence of managing earnings via real activities – compromises in workplace safety.  Our findings highlight that costs of real activities management can accrue not only in monetary terms but also in terms of employee health.  The effects we document may represent the “tip of the iceberg” in terms of the overall employee health since OSHA collects data on only relatively serious and physical injuries/illnesses such as those that require hospitalization, days away from work, or job transfers.  Additionally, in the light of recent findings that investors face greater difficulty in detecting earnings management via real activities (Kothari et al. , 2016), our results suggest that timely disclosures about workplace safety can serve as signals to investors of certain forms of real activities management.  While some firms are considering providing such disclosures (e. g. , Silverman, 2016), these disclosures are typically not available to investors on a timely basis and in a systematic manner.  We also contribute to the literature on workplace safety and firms’ financial condition.  Cohn and Wardlaw (2016) predict and find that workplace injury rates are associated with high leverage and with negative cash flow shocks.  In a study of the operational performance of restaurant chains in Florida, Bernstein, and Sheen (2016) find that restaurants become safer and cleaner following private equity buyouts.  We focus on managerial attention to earnings targets and find that it diminishes managers’ focus on workplace safety.  Also related to our study, Rose (1990) finds a link between the safety of airline customers and the overall financial health of airlines, and Matsa (2011) finds that in the supermarket industry, competition increases service quality.  Unlike Rose (1990) and Matsa (2011), we focus on employee safety rather than service/product quality, and earnings benchmarks rather than the overall financial health of the firm.  Prior studies also find that accidents and absences are associated with high capacity and labor utilization (See survey by Pouliakas and Theodossiou (2013)).  The stronger association we document between production per employee and injury rates in suspect firm-years relative to nonsuspect firm-years is consistent with an association between workplace safety and high labor utilization.  Our findings do not speak to the magnitude of net welfare effects of compromises in workplace safety on firms or employees.  The socially optimal injury rate likely exceeds zero, and such compromises could overall be desirable if the benefits exceed the costs.  Nevertheless, the negative impact of such compromises on employee health represents a cost for the firms to the extent that it results in higher wage demands, fines, litigation, increased insurance premiums, and negative publicity, and a cost to employees in the form of pain, lost wages, and, in extreme cases, death.  2.  Background.  2. 1.  Safety regulation and incentives for workplace safety.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates workplace safety for most private sector employers in the United States.  Exceptions include employers subject to safety regulation from other federal agencies, such as the Mine Safety and Health Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration.  OSHA promulgates standards including equipment safety, communication of hazards, and training programs. 2 It also regulates compliance by investigating worksites and employee complaints (Kniesner and Leeth, 2014).  From a regulatory perspective, OSHA faces a risk reduction mandate rather than a cost-versus-benefit mandate (Viscusi 1996a, 1996b).  In 2010, companies spent between $52 and $66 billion complying with OSHA regulations (Kniesner and Leeth, 2014), which amounts to between four and five percent of the $1351 billion domestic corporate profits in 2010 per the U. S.  Bureau of Economic Analysis.  This excludes indirect costs, such as the impact of safety measures on the speed of workflow.  Estimates of costs of OSHA regulations per life saved range from $100,000 for respiratory protection, to $78 billion for the regulation of formaldehyde (Viscusi, 2007, Table 2, in 2002 dollars). 3 Company incentives for safety stem from the costs of regulatory noncompliance, such as litigation, workers’ compensation premiums, and wage demands, and from the impact of safety on future revenues, investor/public perceptions, and the ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  OSHA enforces safety regulations by making regular inspections and investigating worker complaints.  Penalties for noncompliance range from citations and fines, which tend to be small, to jail time and court-ordered shutdown for extreme violations (Kniesner and Leeth, 2014).  Injury/illness frequency and severity is also used as a key input in the calculation of workers’ compensation insurance premiums.  According to the Liberty Mutual Workplace Safety Index, businesses’ total direct workers’ compensation costs– insurance, claims, and claims processing – for the top ten injury types amounted to $59. 58 billion in 2014.  Additionally, companies can face wage differentials to compensate employees for injury and illness risk (Wei, 2007.  Viscusi, 2010), and injuries can impede firms’ ability to win contracts that explicitly specify a minimum acceptable safety record as a prequalification condition. 4 For example, the U. S.  Army evaluates bidders’ safety practices in the pre-award phase and can disqualify bidders due to poor workplace safety (e. g. , U. S.  Army, 2012, §4).  Workplace safety can also influence a firm's market value through its effect on public and investor perceptions.  The frequency of injuries/illnesses is informative about operational risks and the likelihood of major accidents, but is not disclosed in a timely manner. ,5,6 Anecdotal evidence also suggests that investors request additional timely disclosures about workplace safety following major accidents that draw media attention (e. g.  Tait 2010.  Coetzee and Van Staden, 2011). 7 Relatedly, in two separate field studies, Longsteeth and Rosenbloom (1973) and Spicer (1978) find that institutional investors and bankers consider social responsibility disclosures in investment decisions.  In a more recent empirical work, Albuquerque et al.  (2015) show that firms with better corporate social responsibility ratings, which incorporates employee safety and rights, experience higher valuations.  Consistent with an impact of employee safety on firm valuation, some firms (e. g. , American Electric Power) use employee safety as an input in the calculation of executive compensation.  Workplace safety also affects employers via its impacts on employers’ ability to attract skilled workers and on employees’ demands for compensation.  Employees with high risk tolerance and low skills self-select into inherently riskier occupations (Hwang et al. , 1992.  DeLeire and Levy, 2004.  Orrenius and Zavodny, 2009).  While employees demand higher pay for riskier occupations (Thaler and Rosen, 1976.  Viscusi, 1978), risk-tolerant employees demand relatively low incremental pay as compensation for risk (Viscusi and Hersch 2001).  The latter result is intuitive because, conditional on having to pay a wage premium for workplace hazards, employers will find the premium less costly for risk-tolerant employees.  While employees can potentially pass some of the anticipated costs to employers via demands for higher wages, and pass ex post costs to employers via litigation or insurance, prior research provides evidence that employees and their families still bear significant costs of injuries.  In addition to deaths or permanent severe disabilities, which perhaps no compensation can cover, studies find that workers who had temporary injuries experience significant earnings losses in the years following injuries (Boden and Galizzi, 1999.  Boden, 2005) and are more likely to be contacted by collection agencies (Keogh et al. , 2000).  Galizzi and Zagorsky (2009) track 9186 employees from 1985 to 2000 and find that employees who spent time away from work due to workplace injuries have dramatically lower wealth and consumption.  Higher injury rates are also associated with lower job satisfaction and higher turnover intent (e. g.  Danna and Griffin, 1999.  McCaughey et al. , 2013).  2. 2.  The OSHA Data Initiative (ODI).  Under the OSHA Data Initiative Program (ODI), which was active from 1996 through 2011, OSHA surveyed private-sector establishments to obtain data on reportable work-related injuries and acute illnesses attributable to work-related activities that occurred during the prior year. 8 An establishment corresponds to a distinct physical location, such as an individual factory or store. 9 In addition to injury and illness data, the survey contains a unique identifier for each establishment and information about the establishment's name, location, number of employees, number of hours worked, and variables indicating unusual events, such as shutdowns, strikes, and natural disasters.  Each year OSHA surveys approximately 80,000 private-sector establishments.  All establishments under OSHA jurisdiction with 11 or more employees are required to keep records of injuries and illnesses unless OSHA exempts the industry due to a past history of low accident rates.  The survey covers primarily larger establishments (typically 40 or more employees) from industries that OSHA classifies as high-hazard, which we list in Appendix B.  Appendix B also lists the industries that OSHA deems low-hazard and exempt from ODI.  The sample selection is designed to ensure that each establishment in the potential data collection universe is surveyed at least once during a three-year cycle.  OSHA uses random sampling method to choose establishments, but establishments that had high injury rates or failed to respond in the prior year are more likely to be surveyed again.  ODI data become publicly available about two years after the year for which safety data are recorded.  OSHA does not give advance notice to establishments that must submit data for the survey, and all covered establishments must have the data ready for the event that they are included in the survey population.  OSHA enforces accurate data collection via audits and fines for detected failure to comply with recordkeeping requirements (See, for example, OSHA Directive 00–1 (CPL2)).  Nevertheless, there could be some degree of underreporting of incidents.  A summary of the 1996 to 1998 audits indicate that about 20% of establishments had recordkeeping errors, to which OSHA responded in 2001 with revised guidelines and practices to improve the recordkeeping (Federal Register number 66. 5916-6135).  <Middle> Research design.  We conduct our analysis using establishment-level data from the ODI survey.  Our dependent variable is the count of injuries, and we accordingly use a count model to estimate the relation between employee safety and the pressure to meet earnings benchmarks.  Based on Burgstahler and Dichev (1997)’s findings on earnings management, we measure periods of pressure to meet benchmarks (Suspect) as firm-years that meet or just beat their earnings benchmarks.  Prior literature provides evidence consistent with investors viewing analyst forecasts as a more important benchmark than prior years’ earnings and zero earnings (e. g. , Dechow et al. , 2003.  Brown and Caylor, 2005.  Gilliam et al. , 2015).  Accordingly, we focus on analyst forecasts as the primary earnings benchmark, and Suspect equals one if an earnings surprise is between zero and two cents, and zero otherwise.  In Section 7 we also report results from additional tests that use prior year's earnings, and zeroearnings as earnings benchmarks.  In our main analyses, we estimate the following model for establishment i in year t, where for a Poisson model, which permits establishment-level fixed effects but also imposes the assumption that the injury rates’ for a negative binomial model, which does not permit establishment-level fixed effects, and variance equals its mean (Cameron and Trivedi, 2015). 10 Establishment-level fixed effects, which subsume higher order (e. g. , firm or industry) fixed effects, allow us to control for unobservable factors affecting the rate of injuries/illnesses in a given establishment, and allow us to interpret the coefficient on Suspect as the injury rates relative to the establishments’ typical injury rates.  Establishment-level fixed effects have the drawback of requiring at least two observations for each establishment.  To control for various firm characteristics that may affect workplace safety, the regressions include the natural logarithm of beginning total assets (Ln(Assets)), the beginning-of-year ratio of total short- and long-term debt to total assets (Leverage), the beginning-of-year ratio of net property, plant and equipment to total assets (PPE/Assets), current period sales divided by beginning total assets (Turnover), current period capital expenditures divided by beginning total assets (CapEx/Assets), and the beginning-of-year ratio of market value of assets to book value of assets (M/B).  We measure market value of assets as the sum of market value of equity, book value of total liabilities, and liquidation value of preferred stock minus deferred tax liabilities.  Appendix C provides detailed variable definitions.  We also include several establishment-level variables available from the OSHA dataset to control for establishmentspecific factors that may affect the number of cases.  We include the number of annual hours worked by an average employee in the establishment (HoursPerEmployee) because work hours can be associated with injury rates. 11 In addition, Suspect firms could attempt to keep costs down by extracting more work per employee, which necessitates controlling for the average effect of hours per employee in our models.  We include an indicator variable for whether the establishment has seasonal work (Seasonal) as a control for the higher rates of injury among temporary workers (Quinlan et al. , 2001).  The hours worked and seasonal indicator also serve as controls for employees’ overall experience level.  We also include the following variables as controls.  the average number of employees working in the establishment during the year (EstablishmentSize), and indicator variables for whether there was any strike/lockout (Strike), shutdown/layoffs (Shutdown), or a natural disaster/adverse weather conditions affecting the establishment (NaturalDisaster).  We include these indicator variables in order to control for the impact of unusual factors.  4.  Data and summary statistics.  4. 1.  Data.  Our sample is comprised of establishments from the ODI that can be linked to firms in Compustat annual file for the 2002–2011 period.  We begin our sample period in 2002 because OSHA simplified and changed its recording criteria for injuries and illnesses and the coverage of industries that year, and values for prior years are not comparable.  OSHA discontinued the ODI in 2011 due to funding cuts.  We manually match establishments from the ODI to firms in Compustat based on names.  In particular, for each establishment name listed in ODI, we first search for a matching Compustat name.  If the search does not produce any matches, we conduct additional searches through Hoovers, company/establishment websites, and other online resources to identify whether the establishment matches with a subsidiary of a Compustat firm.  Each firm in Compustat may have multiple establishments.  We require observations in our sample to have valid values for the variables used in the main analyses reported in Table 3.  We exclude financial firms and firms in regulated industries (SIC codes 6000–6999 and 4900–4999). 12 To align financial data with the data on injuries and illnesses, which are measured over calendar years, we limit the sample to firms that have December fiscal year ends.  We also require availability of analyst forecast data from I/B/E/S.  Based on these criteria, our initial sample contains 42,327 establishment-years.  From the initial sample, we eliminate 254 observations that list zero employees or do not include the number of employees.  A small number of observations exhibit extremely low or high hours worked per employee or extremely high injury/illness rates, which are likely data errors.  For example, the highest and lowest number of hours worked per employee are 2 million and 0, respectively.  Accordingly, we eliminate 613 observations for which hours worked per employee is at the top or bottom half-percentile or the number of injury/illness cases at the top half-percentile.  Finally, we require that number of employees in the sample establishments of a given firm represents at least five percent of the total number of employees of that firm, as reported in Compustat.  This requirement further eliminates 6,110 observations.  Our conclusions are not sensitive to the five percent cut-off, and remain similar if we use three percent or ten percent as the cut-off value. 13 The final sample includes 35,350 establishment-year observations from 868 unique firms that operate in industries covered by the ODI and are represented in Compustat and I/B/E/S.  Untabulated analysis shows that the median establishment has two observations in our sample, with a maximum of ten for establishments that OSHA surveys each year and a minimum of one for establishments that did not remain operational sufficiently long to be included in more than one of the three-year survey cycles.  4. 2.  Descriptive statistics Table 1, Panel A provides summary statistics for establishment-level variables.  The average establishment in our sample has 335 employees, and employees work an average of close to 2,000 hours per year.  Following OSHA's definition, we calculate the number of illness/injury cases as the sum of injuries or illnesses that result in days away from work or in transfers and other recordable cases.  The median number of cases per establishment is 7 and the average is 22.  Also based on OSHA's definition, we calculate the total case rate (TCR) as the annualized number of cases per 100 employees. 14 The median case rate implies that in an average establishment-year, an employee has 5. 7% probability of sustaining work-related illnesses/injuries.  Table 1, Panel B provides summary statistics for firm-level variables.  We winsorize all financial variables at the top and bottom percentile.  The median firm has Ln(Assets) of about 8. 9, which indicates that the median firm is fairly large and has total assets of about $7. 3 billion.  Leverage averages about 29 percent.  On average, property, plant and equipment (PP&E) represents 35 percent of our sample firms’ assets.  Turnover averages $1. 25 of sales per dollar of beginning assets, and capital expenditures average 5% of beginning assets.  The median firm in our sample has an asset market-to-book ratio of 1. 38 which compares to 1. 31 in Cohn and Wardlaw (2016).  Table 1, Panel C provides the Pearson (below diagonal) and Spearman (above diagonal) correlations between TCR and accounting variables.  The correlations indicate that the case rates are higher in suspect firm-years, in capital-intensive firms with more PP&E and higher capital expenditures, and in firms with high turnover.  Firm size, leverage, and market-to-book ratios are also all positively associated with the case rate, although correlations are weaker for these variables.  As we explain in Section 6. 1, we use industry union membership data from the Union Membership and Coverage Database as a proxy for employees’ ability to protect their rights. 15 Industries with high unionization exhibit higher case rates, consistent with a higher value of joining a union in more hazardous industries.  Table 1, Panel D provides the distribution of observations by year.  Panel D shows that 2011 is underrepresented in our sample.  This is because ODI was discontinued in 2011 and not all of the data for 2011 was available at the time we received the data files from OSHA's Office of Statistical Analysis in late 2014.  Our findings are not sensitive to exclusion of 2011 from our sample.  We provide average establishment-level case rates by the parent firm's Fama-French industry classifications in Table 2, along with the industry-level unionization rate.  We do not report case rates for the financial and regulated industries because we exclude them from the sample.  The transportation and food products industries have the highest total case rates, with over 11 percent of employees having an injury or illness in a given year.  The coal and tobacco products industries have the lowest case rates. 16 5.  Relation between benchmark beating and workplace safety.  5. 1.  Relation between meeting/beating expectations and injury/illness rates.  We begin our analysis by visually inspecting the relation between total case rate and earnings surprises.  We define earnings surprise using earnings per share and analyst forecast data from I/B/E/S, and calculate it as the difference between the actual earnings per share and the average of all analysts’ latest forecast made within [-180, -4] day window prior to the earnings announcement date, rounded to the nearest cent.  We define firms that are suspected of engaging in earnings management as those that meet or beat expectations by two cents or less. 17 Fig.  1 presents the distribution of injury/illness case rates at the firm level by proximity to analysts’ earnings expectation categories.  The figure shows that the distribution of injury/illness rates in suspect firm-years category (i. e. , meet/just-beat) visibly differs from that in other categories.  For example, while about 46. 9% of firm-years in the meet/just-beat category have low injury/illness rates, this figure is about 55. 6% for firms that comfortably beat and 51. 4% and 50. 6% for firms with both small and large misses, respectively.  In turn, 26. 1% of firm-years in the meet/just-beat category have high injury/illness rates, versus 20. 0–22. 5% for firms in other categories.  The median case rate in the meet/just-beat category is 4. 24 compared to 3. 69 in the remaining categories.  Stated differently, about one in 24 employees in firm-years in meet/just-beat category get injured compared to one in 27 in the other categories.  Table 3 presents estimates from the model defined in Eq.  (1).  The first three columns report results of negative binomial models and the last three columns report results of Poisson models.  The Poisson models have a smaller sample size because the fixed effects estimation requires more than one observation per establishment.  The dependent variable is the number of injuries/illnesses and the exposure variable is the number of hours worked.  Columns (3) and (6) report firm-level estimates with firm and year fixed effects.  The other columns present establishment-level results with establishment-level fixed effects.  In all models, we cluster standard errors at the firm level and include year fixed effects.  Consistent with the positive univariate correlation between TCR and Suspect in Table 1, columns (1) and (4) of Table 3 show that, on average, firms that meet or just beat expectations have higher case rates.  The coefficient on Suspect is 0. 261 in column (1) and 0. 117 in column (4).  Untabulated results indicate that establishment-level fixed effects account for most of the difference in the coefficients.  In particular, estimating the negative binomial model using the sample for which the Poisson models are estimated yields a coefficient of 0. 232 on Suspect, which is similar to that in column (1).  When we exclude establishment-level fixed effects from the Poisson model and use the same sample as in column (1), the coefficient on Suspect is 0. 252.  Columns (2) and (5) include control variables, and in these models the coefficient on Suspect remains statistically significant at the 1% level.  To understand the economic size of the effect, we transform coefficients to incidence rates (eβgive the percentage increase in the expected injury/illness case count for suspect firm-years.  In the full models at the establishment level, the coefficients on Suspect are 0. 142 and 0. 052 in columns (2) and (5), respectively, which translate to the incidence rates of 0. 15 and 0. 05.  That is, in suspect firm-years, the case rates in establishments are higher by 5% – 15% compared to non-suspect firm-years.  Firm-level analyses reported in columns (3) and (6) confirm the establishment-level findings and we find similar coefficients on Suspect.  In column (2) most of the control variables are statistically significant and, with the exception of Ln(Assets), the coefficients on variables from financial statements are in the same direction as those in Cohn and Wardlaw (2016).  In particular, workplace injuries are positively associated with leverage, PP&E, and asset turnover, and are weakly or insignificantly associated with capital expenditures and market-to-book ratio.  Cohn and Wardlaw (2016) find an insignificant or negative coefficient on asset size whereas we find a positive coefficient.  In column (5) these variables are largely insignificant. 18 This could be an artifact of establishment-level fixed effects subsuming the variation in variables which are fairly sticky.  Column (2) also shows a higher number of cases in establishments where employees work fewer hours, and in establishments that employ more seasonal workers.  The significant coefficients on these variables are consistent with experienced workers having fewer injuries.  Also consistent with our discussion in Section 3, the negative coefficient for hours per employee suggest that accidents do not stem from more hours, per se, but from how employees allocate their effort during their hours worked.  There are also more cases in establishments in which employees go on a strike.  The results in Table 3 suggest that excluding the establishment or firm fixed effects may induce an upward bias in the coefficient estimates on Suspect.  We therefore focus on the Poisson model with fixed effects for the remainder of the study.  5. 2.  Evidence on the drivers of higher injury/illness rates in suspect firm-years Manager efforts to boost earnings can either indirectly or directly impact worker safety.  Managers can indirectly, and perhaps inadvertently, detract from safety by increasing workloads, hours, or the desired speed of work flow.  For example, rushed employees may have more accidents, and increased workload and hours without additional rest and recovery time can increase stress-related injuries.  Managers can also directly impact safety by cutting safety-related expenditures.  In this section, we conduct analyses to shed light on the effect of these mechanisms on injuries in suspect firm-years.  We test for evidence of a relation between employee safety in suspect firm-years and workloads using two measures – production per employee and revenue per employee.  If high workloads contribute to the injuries in suspect firm-years, then we expect a stronger positive relation between workloads and injuries in suspect firm-years compared to non-suspect firmyears.  We define production per employee (ProdperEmp) as the sum of cost of goods sold and change in inventory scaled by the number of employees at the firm, and similarly define revenue per employee (RevperEmp) as the firm's total revenues scaled by the number of employees.  The interaction between workloads and Suspect serves as a proxy for workload changes related to meeting or beating expectations, as opposed to workload changes driven by longer-term considerations.  To the extent suspect firms increase workloads in order to meet or beat expectations, we expect to observe a positive and significant coefficient on the interaction terms.  Table 4 reports the results from this analysis.  Columns (1) and (3) report establishment-level regressions that include establishment-level controls in addition to the firm-level controls.  Columns (2) and (4) report firm-level regressions.  We find a positive relation on the interaction of ProdperEmp and Suspect.  The estimated coefficients indicate that a ten percent increase in production per employee is associated with a roughly one percent increase in firm-level injuries/illnesses in suspect firm-years relative to non-suspect firm-years. 19 The coefficient on the interaction term is insignificant when we measure output as revenue per employee.  The weaker results using revenue per employee could be because revenue reflects the mark-up on products in addition to the employee efforts.  The coefficients on ProdperEmp and RevperEmp are insignificant and have fairly wide confidence intervals.  However, the significant interaction term (ProdperEmp  Suspect) indicates that the relation between production and injury rates is more positive in suspect firm-years compared to non-suspect firm-years.  In other words, the significant interaction indicates that the confidence interval on ProdperEmp shifts to the right in suspect firm-years.  The insignificance of ProdperEmp could be because high production levels in typical periods do not come at the expense of safety and injuries relate to random events unrelated to production per employee.  In order to test whether managers directly impact workplace safety in suspect firm-years by cutting safety expenditures, we examine whether injuries tend to be more common among suspect firms that reduce their discretionary expenditures.  An ideal test would measure safety-related expenditures, such as the costs of maintenance, training and oversight programs.  However, companies do not separately report such expenditures, and these costs, which could add up to non-trivial amounts, fall within selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A). 20 To gauge whether managers cut safety expenditures, we estimate abnormal discretionary expenses per employee (AbDiscExp) based on Roychowdhury (2006) where we scale by beginning total employees rather than beginning total assets. 21 In particular, AbDiscExp is the residual from the following model which is estimated for firm i in year t within each two-digit SIC code/year with at least 15 observations, where SGA is the total selling, general, and administrative expenditures.  To test cuts to safety expenditures explanation, we include the interaction of Suspect and AbDiscExp in Eq.  (1) and reestimate the model.  We predict that if higher injuries in suspect firm-years stem in part from cuts to safety-related expenditures, then, compared to the non-suspect firm years, the number of injuries in suspect firm-years will be more strongly associated with cuts to these expenditures.  In other words, we expect the coefficient on the interaction between Suspect and AbDiscExp to be negative and statistically significant.  Table 5 reports the results from estimating the relation between injuries and abnormal expenses in suspect firm-years. 22 Column (1) reports establishment-level regression that includes establishment-level controls in addition to the firm-level controls.  Column (2) reports firm-level regressions.  Both the establishment-level and firm-level regressions show a negative coefficient for the interaction of Suspect and AbDiscExp.  That is, the relation between injuries and abnormal discretionary expenditures is more negative in suspect firm-years.  This result is consistent with cuts to safety-related expenditures playing a role in higher injuries in suspect firm-years relative to non-suspect firm-years.  We acknowledge that, our findings on the interaction between Suspect and AbDiscExp could also result from the interaction term providing a superior gauge of overall earnings management efforts than Suspect and AbDiscExp individually.  For example, in addition to maintenance and safety-related expenditures, AbDiscExp could capture earnings-motivated cuts to other expenses in conjunction with changes to workloads.  To the extent this holds, our findings in Table 5 might reflect a better detection of earnings management periods, as well as the effect of changes in safety-related expenditures.  6.  Cross-sectional differences in the relation between benchmark beating and workplace safety.  In this section we present cross-sectional tests of the relation between benchmark beating and workplace safety.  We consider three factors that could affect managers’ flexibility and incentives to compromise worker safety.  First, we consider unionization as a proxy for employees’ power to ensure safe work environments, even when the company faces pressure to meet benchmarks.  Second, we consider costs of workers’ compensation insurance as a proxy for costs firms can face for compromising workplace safety in order to meet or beat expectations.  Third, we consider government contracting as a proxy for managers’ incentives to keep work environments safe as firms can be disqualified from bidding on government contracts based on safety records and requirements. 23 6. 1.  Union membership.  Organized labor likely diminishes the extent to which managers can alter workloads and processes in a way that compromises safety since unions bargain over and participate in the enforcement of workloads and safety (Kaufman 2005).  Unionized workers perceive less workplace risk (Gillen et al.  2002) and tend to have fewer injuries (Morantz 2013).  We examine whether unions diminish the association between workplace safety and benchmark beating.  We use industry union membership data from the Union Membership and Coverage Database as our proxy for employees’ ability to protect their rights.  The database reports estimates of union membership by census industry codes with an annual frequency based on data compiled from the Current Population Survey.  To identify whether an industry has high or low union membership, we match census industry codes to two digit NAICS industry codes and then calculate average union membership for each industry over 2003–2011 period using industry-years that have at least 200 households responding to the survey nationwide.  We exclude 2002 during which census industry definitions were different. 24 We then merge this dataset with our establishment sample.  The union membership among sample establishments varies from 1. 7% to 41. 7%.  We define high union membership establishments as those that have union membership values above the top quartile.  If union membership limits managers’ ability to shirk on workplace safety to meet or beat expectations, then we expect to find weaker results in suspect firm-years that are in high union membership category.  Table 6, columns (1) and (2), report results from this analysis.  In both columns we find that the coefficient on the interaction term is negative and significant.  The effect is also economically significant.  The establishment-level analysis indicates that injury rates are lower by about 6. 4% in suspect firm-years when there is more union presence.  These results support the conjecture that the association between workplace safety and benchmark beating diminishes with union membership. 25 Overall, the results reported in columns (1) and (2) suggest that unions limit managers’ ability to shirk on workplace safety in their attempts to meet or beat expectations.  6. 2.  Workers’ compensation premiums.  Workers’ compensation is a state-mandated insurance program that provides compensation to employees who suffer from workplace injuries or illnesses.  Workers’ compensation systems are established by statutes in each state and each state has different policies and coverage requirements.  As a result, the average workers’ compensation premium varies significantly across states, ranging from $0. 88 per $100 of payroll in North Dakota to $3. 48 per $100 of payroll in California in 2014 according to data compiled by the State of Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS).  Workers compensation premiums equal a state-level baseline premium times a multiplier called the experience modification rate.  The computation of the experience modification rate depends on the employer's claims and safety record during the past three years and is fairly standard across states (National Council on Compensation Insurance, 2015).  For example, a company with a typical injury record will have an experience modification rate of 1. 0 and will pay the state's baseline premium.  If deteriorations in workplace safety cause the firm's experience modification rate to increase from 1. 0 to, say 1. 25, its premium will increase by 25% of the baseline premium.  As this example demonstrates, each workplace injury has a larger dollar impact in states with higher baseline premiums.  We conjecture that managers’ willingness to increase workloads and demands on employees in their attempts to meet or beat expectations will be weaker when workplace injuries have a larger effect on the workers’ compensation premium costs.  To test this conjecture, we use DCBS’ workers’ compensation premium ranking by state.  DCBS calculates the average workers’ compensation premium base rate (i. e. , rate before experience modification factor and other firm-specific factors) paid by businesses in each state on a biennial basis and ranks states from the highest to the lowest.  We link this data to the location of each establishment in our dataset.  Since DCBS conducts the study biennially, we assume that rankings apply to the year of and the year prior to the study.  We classify establishments as operating in high workers’ compensation premium states if they are in the top quartile of the sample.  We predict that the relation between benchmark beating and workplace safety will be weaker for establishments located in states with high workers’ compensation premiums.  Table 6, column (3) reports the results from estimating (1) with an interaction term for Suspect and high premium states.  We conduct this analysis only at the establishment level because each firm can have establishments in various states, which prevents us from constructing a firm-level workers’ compensation premium ranking.  We find that the coefficient on the interaction term in column (3) is significant and negative.  The incidence rate based on the coefficient on the interaction term indicates that suspect firm-years in high premium states have 4. 8% lower injury rates than those in lower premium states.  This result is consistent with higher impact of workplace injuries on longer-term costs deterring managers from compromising on workplace safety in their attempts to meet or beat expectations.  6. 3.  Government contracting.  Workplace injuries can have a significant impact on a firm's ability to win government contracts.  Federal and state governments typically require their contractors to have and maintain adequate workplace safety in order to prequalify for bidding on government contracts.  For example, the U. S.  Army conducts detailed evaluations of bidders’ safety practices in the pre-award phase (U. S.  Army, 2012), and federal and state governments typically specify a minimum experience modification rate, which reflects the potential contractors’ employee safety record, to prequalify for bidding on various types of contracts. 26 Firms that do not meet the workplace safety criteria can be disqualified from bidding on government contracts. 27 We conjecture that managers will be more reluctant to compromise workplace safety in order to meet or beat expectations if they are bidding for government contracts.  Accordingly, we expect that the relation between benchmark beating and employee safety will be weaker among firms that enter into major government contracts.  We use data from USAspending. gov to identify firms that do business with the government.  The website is aimed at informing taxpayers about how their taxes are spent, and all federal agencies that make contract, grant, loan, or financial assistance awards of $25,000 or more are required to report to USAspending. gov.  USAspending. gov provides data about government contracts awarded at the establishment level with a unique identifier for each establishment.  Using this dataset, we first calculate the total value of contracts awarded to each establishment over the previous two years. 28 We then merge these totals with our main dataset, aggregate these amounts over all establishments of each firm-year in our sample, and the cost measure is the firm's within-year rank based on their aggregate government contract size.  We do not use a quartile measure as in the previous two tests because only about 20% have any amount of government contract reported by USAspending. gov.  In Table 6, columns (4) and (5), both the establishment- and firm-level regressions show a significant coefficient on the interaction term.  This suggests that suspect firms with more government businesses have fewer injuries compared to suspect firms with little or no government businesses.  These findings are consistent with the disciplining role of the risk of losing government contracts on compromising workplace safety.  Overall, these results suggest that managers are more reluctant to compromise employee safety in their attempts to meet or beat expectations when they have additional incentives for keeping their workplace safe.  7.  Alternative definition of earnings benchmarks.  In our main analyses, we focus on analyst forecasts as the earnings benchmark.  In untabulated analyses, we reexamine the relation between employee safety and benchmark beating using prior year's earnings and zero-earnings as alternative earnings benchmarks.  For the prior year's earnings benchmark, we follow Burgstahler and Dichev (1997) and Dechow et al.  (2003) and define suspect firm-years as those for which the difference between current year and prior year net income scaled by beginning of prior year's market value is between zero and 0. 01.  For the zero-earnings benchmark, we define suspect firm-years as those where the current year net income scaled by beginning of year market value is between zero and 0. 02, and zero otherwise.  In these tests, we find that our conclusions continue to hold when we use prior year's earnings as the earnings benchmark.  In particular, we find that the coefficient on Suspect is statistically significant, and in economic terms it indicates that in suspect firm-years case rates are higher by 4–7% compared to non-suspect firm-years.  In contrast, we do not find a statistically significant coefficient on Suspect for the zero-earnings benchmark.  This finding indicates that firms trying to avoid losses do not have higher incidence of injuries/illnesses.  These patterns we observe around different earnings benchmarks is consistent with Dechow et al.  (2003), who find that the zero-earnings benchmark is becoming less important than other benchmarks.  The pattern is also consistent with Gilliam et al.  (2015), who report that earnings management incentives to avoid losses, and hence the zero-earnings discontinuity, has disappeared after the passage of SOX in 2002 but discontinuities around analyst forecasts and to a lesser extent prior year's earnings remain.  <Conclusion> Conclusion.
