 
Various business and political leaders in the United States have expressed concerns that the U. S.  system of taxing multinationals effectively subsidizes foreign takeovers ( White, 2014 ; Hatch, 2014 ).  Prior research on mergers and acquisitions 
(M&A) demonstrates how variation in tax rates ( Scholes and Wolfson, 1990, Arulampalam Name, 2010 ) and in tax systems 
( Huizinga and Voget, 2009 ; Feld Name, 2016 ) impact the market for corporate control.  As a result, ﬁrms under a worldwide 
tax system are tax-disadvantaged acquirers .  Furthering this line of inquiry, we posit that ﬁrms under a worldwide tax system 
are also tax-favored targets of foreign acquirers.
