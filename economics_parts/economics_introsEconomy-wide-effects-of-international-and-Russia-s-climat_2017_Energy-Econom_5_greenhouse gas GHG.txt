 1.  Introduction At the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, the parties agreed on an ambitious target to limit the increase in global mean temperature to 1. 5–2. 0 °C.  Among other countries, Russia proposed a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and has submitted a pledge to the United Nations (UN), which proposes a 25–30% reduction in Russia's GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 (Carbon Brief, 2015).  At present, Russia is one of the world's largest producers of GHG emissions.
