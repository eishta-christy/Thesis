 1.  Introduction In order to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), policies could either attempt to reduce the proﬁtability of agriculture, e. g.  by removing agricultural subsidies, or offer positive incentives such as payment for environmental services (PES) that aim to put a price on forest externalities (Angelsen, 2010.  Palmer, 2011).  The latter have come to dominate both project and nascent jurisdictional-scale REDD+ strategies (see e. g.  Mahanty et al. , 2013.  Sills et al. , 2014).  Acre State in Brazil, the setting for our paper, is currently at the forefront of efforts to institutionalize jurisdictional-scale REDD+.  At an estimated cost of US$260 million, the State government's objective is to reduce deforestation by 80% by 2020, thus conserving 5. 5 million ha of forest in order to prevent the release of 62. 5 Mt of CO2 emissions (Herbert, 2010).  To this end, Acre has established a ‘PES-like’ scheme known as the Incentive System for Environmental Services (SISA) framework.  Its objective is to internalize values associated with forest carbon, as well as biodiversity and hydrological services, by incentivizing landowners to conserve forest on their landholdings.  In this paper, we model a hypothetical SISA payment in order to address two related questions.  First, given the extent of uncertainty in land-use returns from forest conversion, what is the minimum level of payment that Acre's government should pay to landowners to ensure forest conservation with a 90% probability.  Reﬂecting the common practice of Latin American incentive payment schemes, our payment is held constant over time.  The ‘90% probability’ is illustrative of a setting in which there is a relatively strong commitment on the part of the policymaker to enforce conservation contracts and hence, keep land in forest.  That said, should alternative land uses become more proﬁtable, e. g.  due to rising commodity prices, it may not be possible to prevent contract breach altogether thus reﬂecting imperfect enforcement of conservation contracts (e. g.  Engel and Palmer, 2008.  MacKenzie et al. , 2012.  Jayachandran, 2013).  Our model is applied to municipality-scale, publicly-available data, which allows us to estimate the uncertain returns of an ‘average’ landowner within each municipality, one faced with the decision of whether to keep land in forest or convert it to an alternative land use.  For each of Acre's municipalities, we estimate the uncertain returns for three alternative land uses.  cattle, corn, and coffee.  These three land uses are among the most popular ones adopted in Acre and have relatively good data availability.  We then identify the minimum per hectare cost to the policymaker of conserving forest in each of Acre's 22 municipalities before ranking the municipalities according to ascending payment levels, i. e.  moving from the municipalities with the lowest opportunity costs to those with the highest ones.  The second question we ask is whether and (if so) how this ranking of municipalities changes when we consider their carbon stocks.  Finally, our estimates of policy costs are combined with carbon stock data to give a novel measure of municipality-scale environmental cost-effectiveness.  the minimum relative cost, in terms of the forgone proﬁts from alternative land uses under uncertainty, per tonne of carbon.  In studies that evaluate the cost-effectiveness and efﬁciency of PES, two key assumptions are typically made.  First, it is often assumed that future returns from forest conversion are known with certainty (e. g.  Ferraro and Simpson, 2002.  Börner et al. , 2010.  Groom and Palmer, 2010.  Palmer and Silber, 2012.  Curran et al. , 2016).  Yet, up-front investments combined with greater uncertainty in agricultural returns create incentives to delay the decision to convert forest to an alternative use (Schatzki, 2003).  This implies that a lower level of incentive would be required to prevent forest conversion.  In general, a failure to consider uncertainty in future agricultural returns results in estimates of the opportunity costs of forest conservation that are biased upwards.  The consequence is that payment levels would be set higher than necessary in order to incentivize forest conservation.  Second, it is also commonly assumed that the environmental beneﬁts from conserving forest are homogenous across space.  However, it has become increasingly clear that this assumption is erroneous.  For example, Saatchi et al.  (2011) demonstrate wide variation in forest carbon stocks, even at the local scale, e. g.  within municipalities.  A failure to consider heterogeneity in forests and their corresponding eco-system services can thus lead to under- or over-estimates of beneﬁts from conservation (see Vincent, 2016).  In Acre, funds for SISA remain dependent on public sources of funding despite a Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2010 with the US State of California to provide REDD+ credits.  There is currently little scope for the use of carbon markets and offsetting to augment Acre's conservation budget.  Given this limited budget, the basic idea behind our analysis is to identify municipalities in Acre where it might be possible to conserve a lot of carbon at relatively low cost.  Our paper contributes to Acre's ongoing efforts to design an efﬁcient and effective set of forest conservation institutions, particularly with respect to jurisdictional REDD+, which are described in Section 2.  We do so by adapting the model of uncertain land-use returns by Engel et al.  (2015), in Section 3.  First, we adapt their model so that it is more consistent with most Latin American PES schemes, namely by changing the incentive from a variable to a ﬁxed, area-based payment and by creating a shorter payments period (ﬁve years instead of 30).  Second, in examining three different land uses and with 22 different starting points, i. e.  one for each municipality in Acre, we move away from their focus on a single alternative land use and a single starting point for estimating policy costs.  We exploit spatial heterogeneity in land-use returns and model these returns over time using publicly available data, which are described in Section 4.  Since similar data are increasingly available for other tropical countries, in addition to other Brazilian States, our model can easily be applied to other settings and land uses.  Further, we exploit the spatial variation in forest carbon stocks across the State and by comparing these with the relative land use returns, provide an economic rationale for the targeting of REDD+ payments.  Building upon Engel et al.  (2015), our analysis therefore not only estimates the spatial variation in the cost of keeping forests standing but also integrates these costs with forest carbon stock data in order to derive a measure of cost-effectiveness across municipalities.  In sum, our model offers a novel and straightforward way of allocating scarce conservation resources and while our focus is on forest climate beneﬁts, it can easily be expanded to accommodate other ecosystem services and biodiversity.  Presented in Section 5 and discussed in Section 6, our results suggest that although pasture and cattle ranching is not particularly proﬁtable, it is the land use which results in the highest (relative) returns to landowners under uncertainty, in 19 out of 22 municipalities.  With relatively low conversion costs and little volatility in its returns process, pasture determines the minimum payment level in these areas.  Upon ranking municipalities by payment level and by carbon stock, we ﬁnd that cheaper municipalities tend not to have higher stocks.  However, this type of ranking masks wide differences among municipalities.  Our empirical exercise demonstrates evidence of substantial, economicallymeaningful and policy-relevant variation among municipalities.  On the basis of cost per tonne of carbon, we identify 13 municipalities in which it might be possible to obtain a substantially larger ‘carbon bang’ for one's ‘buck’ in contrast to the other nine municipalities.  2.  Background to Acre State, BRAZIL.  Acre in western Brazil has become a world leader in reducing deforestation while growing its economy (Schwartzman, 2015).  The State is home to around 750,000 people.  Almost half live in the capital, Rio Branco, while the remainder resides among its 22 municipalities.  Since the election of The Acre Workers Party and their allies The Popular Front in 1998, the State government has followed the vision of legendary rubber tapper and environmental activist Chico Mendes towards a sustainable development pathway for the State.  About 14. 3 million ha (143,000 km2) of intact, richly diverse forest, approximately 87% of its total area, is found within State borders.  Primary forest makes up over 85% of forest cover.  The majority of this forest is covered by some form of protection, whether indigenous territory, parks or reserves.  Deforestation has fallen over recent years, from an average annual deforestation rate of 60,200 ha (602 km2) per year between 1996 and 2005, to 49,600 ha (496 km2) per year between 2001 and 2010.  Acre State set itself two main deforestation goals, to reduce levels by 60% of the 1990–2005 average by 2012, and by 80% by 2020.  Total emissions for the State were estimated at 22. 7 Mt CO2e in 2010, of which 97% came from deforestation and land degradation.  The reduction in deforestation rates has meant that Acre has managed to move forward in issuing veriﬁed emission reduction credits to the tune of 11. 5 Mt CO2e through the Markit registry (Forest Trends, 2015).  In order to meet the State's deforestation goals and achieve veriﬁable emission reductions it has created the SISA framework, along with operational principles for a system of incentives, not only for forest carbon but also biodiversity and hydrological services.  The majority of deforested lands are now pasture (TerraClass, 2011) and this is representative of the typology of the agricultural sector in Acre.  Pasture lands make up approximately 8% of total land area of the State.  By contrast, temporary crops take up 1% of total land area, of which cassava and corn account for the greatest share.  The acreage of permanent crops is much smaller, just 0. 1% of land area.  The largest permanent crop is banana, approximately 60% of the total, followed by rubber and coffee, at around 11% each.  Acre has 22 municipalities.  A major land-zoning exercise in 2006, focusing on both economic and ecological concerns, created four major land-use zones (Governo do Estado do Acre, 2011).  Zone 1 (25% of State land) is private land or agricultural settlements of which approximately half is deforested.  Zone 2 (49%) is intact primary or managed forests in indigenous territories, sustainable use reserves, settlement projects, state and national production forests, and strictly protected areas.  Zone 3 (26%) has largely intact forest cover but has land tenure that is unclear or where claims overlap.  and, Zone 4 (0. 2%) is deﬁned as urban.  <Middle> Model.  Engel developed a general model of a conservation payment scheme with ﬁxed and variable components in which the latter is either indexed to the value of one or more services provided by forest, e. g.  carbon, or to the expected net returns from forest conversion, e. g.  soya bean production.  By tracking carbon or soya prices, this variable component thus allows the payment to vary over time.  The scheme's objective is to provide sufﬁcient incentives to keep land in forest rather than convert it to an alternative use.  In this paper, we retain their objective and basic model but adapt the latter in three ways.  First, since shorter contracts are typically found in Latin American payment for environmental services (PES) schemes, e. g.  in Costa Rica (Pagiola, 2008), we model a conservation contract of ﬁve rather than 30 years.  Second, also in common with many Latin American PES schemes, we model a payment that is not indexed but instead is ﬁxed and unchanging over time.  Finally, although our payment is characterised as an incentive provided by Acre's government to conserve forest carbon stocks (a generic ‘REDD+ payment’), it does not reﬂect the social value of the carbon in a given hectare of forest.  Rather, it is calculated as the minimum payment required to keep forest standing when the net returns from alternative land uses are uncertain.  Below, we reproduce the model of Engel et al.  (2015) and intuitively explain the theory underlying our adaptation of their model.  3. 1.  Landowner's decision.  For a single hectare of land, proﬁts can be generated from one of two alternative uses.  forest (F) or agriculture (A).  For simplicity, we do not specify A in this section, although as explained in Section 4 it can be pasture (cattle), corn, or coffee.  Whenever land use is changed from F to A, conversion costs, CCFA, are sunk immediately.  Proﬁts to a landowner from forest conservation are generated by a REDD+ payment scheme implemented by Acre's State government.  This payment is paid annually and is ﬁxed at F, i. e.  future returns from forest are certain.  Net proﬁts from agriculture are generated from crop sales1 and future returns from agriculture are uncertain.  In theory, the presence of uncertainty in agricultural returns should delay land conversion until the value of non-use beneﬁts equals the value of land in the next-best alternative use plus conversion costs plus an option value.  Our aim is to identify an F that makes this option value sufﬁciently large to deter land conversion for a total of ﬁve years.  New information about the uncertain returns from agriculture is assumed to become available at various times such that they may be modelled as a stochastic process (e. g.  geometric Brownian motion, GBM).  The net returns from agriculture to the land owner, A, is private information which evolves as a function of the constant trend parameter μA and the (positive) constant uncertainty parameter A where dWA=ϵ√dt with ϵ distributed as a standard normal random variable, e. g.  ϵ∈N(0,1).  A positive (negative) μA indicates that net agricultural proﬁts are, on average, increasing (decreasing).  In Section 5, we parameterize the agricultural returns processes.  On each day, dt, a landowner receives Fdt if the land is in forest or Adt if the land is in agriculture.  With a starting point of land in forest, the landowner decides, every six months, whether to continue conserving forest or to convert the forest to agriculture.  The decision to change land use generates instantaneous proﬁts net of conversion costs.  Alternatively, the landowner can delay the decision to deforest and continue to receive REDD+ payments.  Thus, the value of a single hectare of forest is this.  The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq.  (2) describes the returns if the land is kept in forest.  In this case, the landowner receives a payment of Fdt and the discounted future expected returns from forest conservation.  Therefore, πF represents the sum of the landowner's returns from non-use beneﬁts of the forest (current land use) and the future value of land in the next-best alternative use (forest or agriculture) where E is the expectation operator.  All returns are valued by discounting their expected values at the constant, continuously compounded, risk-free discount rate r.  The second term of Eq.  (2) represents the returns when the land is converted from forest to agriculture.  The landowner incurs sunk conversion costs equal to {CCFA}.  Using the same line of reasoning and with a starting point of land in agriculture, we can obtain the equation that describes the returns if the land is kept in agriculture, g(F,A,t) and the expression πA that represents the sum of landowner's returns from agriculturalTo solve the land use change problem, we ﬁrst evaluate the optimal conversion boundaries as in Engel et al.  (2015).  These depend upon the parameters of the returns from forest F and agriculture A, respectively, the conversion costs {CCFA} and the discount rate r.  We then solve for the optimal land-use change numerically.  Instead of modelling the price and crop yield uncertainties separately, the agricultural returns processes are modelled directly.  This simpliﬁes our analysis considerably and allows us to utilize existing numerical techniques, used by e. g.  Miranda and Fackler (2002), Dangl and Wirl (2004), to solve the optimal land–conversion problem.  In practice, the landowner compares two alternative land uses as described below.  3. 2.  REDD+ payment parameters.  Our model is used to simulate REDD + payment scenarios in order to estimate the level of incentive needed to ensure that the landowner continues to postpone the decision to switch from forest to agriculture.  The landowner's opportunity costs of forest conservation are the forgone returns to agriculture, A.  Given A we estimate the level of the REDD + payment that ensures forest conservation.  We assume that Acre's government seeks to achieve conservation at the lowest possible cost and that the landowner will not always comply with the REDD+ contract.  Thus, we introduce the possibility that at some point it might be more proﬁtable for the landowner to convert forest to agriculture.  The potential for contract breach is modelled using a probability-based criterion, in which p is deﬁned as the probability of avoiding deforestation and (1 − p) corresponds to the probability of deforestation.  For a given hectare of forest, we establish an illustrative probability level of p = 0. 9 and a time horizon of T = 5 and estimate the REDD+ payment necessary to ensure that the land remains in forest.  We argue that a 90% probability of avoiding deforestation reﬂects Acre's ongoing efforts to build institutional capacity for REDD+ at the jurisdictional level, including institutions for monitoring and enforcement.  Thus, this 90% probability is illustrative of a setting in which there is a relatively strong commitment on the part of the policymaker to enforce conservation contracts and hence, keep land in forest. 2 Note that, operationally, we implement the same payment regime as Engel et al.  (2015) but identify a constant per-hectare payment F. 3 In our adaptation, the landowners' opportunity costs of forest conservation are based on uncertain returns from the production and sale of coffee, corn or cattle.  To determine the REDD+ payment that satisﬁes this criterion, we ﬁrst evaluate the optimal conversion boundaries as described above given a speciﬁc set of model parameters.  For a given REDD+ payment level, we simulate the returns from agriculture.  When these returns are below the conversion boundary CFA, the landowner prefers to switch land use, converting forest to agriculture.  This comparison is assessed every six months.  The simulation yields a converted path when agriculture becomes more proﬁtable than forest at any given comparison node.  With forest conversion, the contract is breached and REDD+ payments cease, which is equivalent to imposing a conditionality clause on the REDD+ contract.  Dividing the total number of non-converted paths by the number of simulations, we compute the likelihood of a landuse change from forest to agriculture not occurring, ^p.  The probabilitybased criterion is met when ^p≥p ¼ 0. 9.  4.  Data.  Our model in Section 3 is based on the land-use decision faced by a landowner.  In the absence of landowner-level data, we apply our model to publicly-available agricultural data at the municipality scale.  Thus, we compare differences in average net proﬁts for three, different land uses, which are estimated at the municipality scale from data reported by farmers and landowners sampled within municipalities.  Applying the model presented in Section 3 to real-world data requires ﬁrst identifying the commonest land-use transitions from forest conversion in Acre State over a ﬁve-year period.  From Section 2, pasture for cattle ranching was clearly more common than any of the other land uses put together.  We also select corn as one of the most popular temporary crops and coffee, a permanent crop, which has been gaining in popularity in the region.  While there are other, similarly popular crops, e. g.  cassava, banana, our choice is also determined by data availability.  Municipality-level production data are shown in Appendix 1.  Note that for the ﬁve-year duration of contract it was often the case that land once planted, and with conversion costs sunk, would remain either in pasture or coffee for the whole of this time.  For corn, however, farmers could switch to a different land use after three years thus incurring another round of conversion costs.  We are unable to build another land-use decision into our model simulations for corn and for tractability instead assumed that corn was planted for ﬁve years.  Switching from corn to beef or coffee within ﬁve years would not, however, signiﬁcantly change the ranking of municipalities by minimum payment level.  4. 1.  Daily proﬁts.  The returns from converting a hectare of land from forest to agriculture depend upon a variety of factors including production costs, clearance and conversion costs, yields, prices and transportation costs.  We combine these factors in order to estimate daily proﬁts, Adt.  The perhectare return (in US$) on day t from agricultural commodity x is given by X where P is the price of commodity x in US$/tonne, Y is its yield (tonne/ ha), L is its labour cost (US$/ha), Fe is its fertiliser cost (US$/ha), Fu is its fuel cost (US$/ha), Fix is its ﬁxed cost (US$/ha), and M is the cost of transporting x to market (US$/ha).  For each of corn, cattle and coffee, we estimate the value of each of these variables for each day in the ﬁve-year period between March 31, 2006 and December 30, 2010, before calculating daily returns.  Daily agricultural price data are combined with quarterly data on labour costs, annual yield data, and overall costs per hectare for ﬁxed, labour, fertiliser and fuel in order to create daily revenue and cost time-series, with the costs subtracted from the revenue series to give net proﬁts.  We draw the majority of data from the Brazilian Agricultural Census of 2006 (IBGE, 2006).  More detail on data sources and individual factors, including our measure of carbon stock density, are presented in Appendix 2 and Appendix 3.  Despite relatively good data availability, we face a number of challenges when creating suitable daily price series for our chosen commodities in Acre State.  First, there are gaps in the price data.  In order to create a daily price series for each commodity, we converted the daily price series for São Paulo and via benchmarks for prices in Rio Branco created price series for Acre.  Since this approach factors in differences in prices due to assumptions about the location of demand for each commodity - and hence, where it is transported - it potentially underestimates transportation costs in more remote regions of Acre state.  This is particularly the case for corn and cattle that are not shipped to Rio Branco to be sold.  Second, there are some missing data in the Agricultural Census for some of the cost components of corn and coffee production.  Since we have seen no evidence to suggest that there may be, on average, substantial differences in the costs of coffee and corn production at the municipality scale in the Legal Amazon, we ﬁlled these gaps by applying regression analysis to municipality-scale data for the whole Legal Amazon.  This approach assumes that agricultural production in Acre state follows the same techniques, and utilizes the same mix of inputs, as used by the average Amazonian farmer.  Third, the Agricultural Census reports at the municipality level and is biased towards the sampling of larger farms.  At this scale of aggregation, we may therefore overlook important intra-municipality variation in terms of costs and returns.  If larger farmers have different yields, mix of inputs and costs in contrast to their smaller counterparts our estimates of average returns may not be perfectly representative, especially in municipalities with greater shares of smaller farmers.  We return to the issue of potential variation in proﬁtability among landowners and farmers within municipalities in Section 6.  5.  Results.  We ﬁrst present our estimates of daily net proﬁts for our three agricultural land uses (pasture (cattle), corn, and coffee) at the municipality scale over a ﬁve-year period.  These estimates are used to calculate our model parameters, which are then combined with our estimates of up-front clearance costs in order to simulate the returns processes under uncertainty for each land use in each and every municipality in Acre State.  The returns are then ranked to give the policymaker's cost of the minimum payment to landowners in each municipality.  Cost per municipality is then compared with the distribution of carbon densities across the State.  From our estimates of minimum payment and data for mean carbon stock, we derive a novel measure of relative environmental cost-effectiveness.  the minimum relative cost, in terms of the forgone proﬁts from alternative land uses under uncertainty, per tonne of carbon.  5. 1.  Daily net proﬁts.  Table 1 presents a summary of patterns in the daily per hectare net proﬁts from pasture, corn and coffee between 2006 and 2010.  Only one of these land uses remains proﬁtable over the whole period in 11 municipalities, typically corn.  Pasture appears to result in consistent negative net proﬁts in most municipalities.  Negative net proﬁts are obtained due to the use of observable market prices, which proxy for landowners' returns from alternative land uses.  We conjecture that commercial production may simply be unproﬁtable in much of Acre given remoteness and high costs.  For instance, we may be underestimating prices.  The São Paulo price, even with adjustment may not reﬂect higher prices in local markets due to their remoteness. 4 Subsistence agriculture dominates in a lot of municipalities, which is unlikely to be accounted for in government-collected statistics.  Sampling in the Brazilian Agricultural Census tends to be biased towards larger farms.  Since larger farms are more likely to hire in labour in contrast to smallholders, we may overestimate costs.  Finally, we may be underestimating yields and note that our estimates may be missing subsidies that effectively reduce costs or increase proﬁts, e. g.  credit subsidies.  Fig.  1 illustrates net proﬁts for selected municipalities.  Bujari is a good example of one where there is a clearly ‘strictly dominant’ proﬁtable land use, in this case coffee.  There, a rational land owner would convert forest to this land use rather than either of the other two.  Feijó, on the other hand, illustrates a case where ‘the lines cross’ and the relative proﬁtability of one land use changes such that at different times it would be rational to switch from one of corn, coffee or pasture, to one of the other two, and back again at a later date.
