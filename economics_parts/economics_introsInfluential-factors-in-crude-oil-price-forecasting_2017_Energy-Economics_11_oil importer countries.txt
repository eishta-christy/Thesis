Crude oil is widely considered to be one of the most important
commodities affecting global economic growth.  Estimates indicate
that the oil and gas drilling sector makes up about three percent of
global GDP, and imports of petroleum products account for about
forty percent of U. S.  trade deﬁcits. 1 Movements in crude prices have
been shown to signiﬁcantly impact the world economy at various
levels, from family budgets to corporate earnings and to the national
economy (cf.  Eika and Magnussen, 2000.  Kilian, 2009).  According
to IMF, a 10% increase in oil prices results in a 0. 2% drop in global
GDP.  Therefore, when oil prices reached a record high $145/bbl in
2008, and then began to drop sharply beginning 2014 and reaching a
low $29/bbl in early 2016, this resulted in signiﬁcant revenue shortfalls and economic stress on many energy exporting nations such
as Russia and Saudi Arabia.  On the other hand, the availability of
cheaper oil has been hailed as a potent economic stimulus to many
net oil importer countries such as China and India, while keeping
inﬂation under check. 
Given the central role of oil in the economy there is a great deal of
attention in the literature in forecasting crude prices.
