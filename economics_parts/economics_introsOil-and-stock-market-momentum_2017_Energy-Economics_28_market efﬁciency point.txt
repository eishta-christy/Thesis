Stock market anomalies reﬂect inefﬁciencies in the way information
is disseminated in the market place and reﬂected in asset prices via
investors' trades.  Anomalies also provide the basis for active investment
strategies that aim to generate abnormal proﬁts.  One of the widely
examined anomalies that has been shown to persist in stock markets
is the momentum anomaly which relates to the relationship between
a stock's historical and subsequent performance (e. g.  Asness, 1994. 
Carhart, 1997.  Moskowitz and Grinblatt, 1999.  Jegadeesh and Titman,
1993, 2001).  An important implication of this anomaly is an investment
strategy called momentum investing that is based on buying past
winner stocks and selling past loser stocks.  Thus, apart from being a
matter of concern from an academic perspective, the presence of this
anomaly has signiﬁcant investment implications as well. 
In another popular strand of the literature, numerous studies have
explored the effect of oil market dynamics on stock return and volatility. 
Oil can affect stock market dynamics via a number of different channels. 
At the ﬁrm level, oil price can affect costs and growth expectations,
which then affect stock values.  At the consumer level, oil price can affect
consumer spending via its effect on their disposable income, thus affect
the demand for the products that drive ﬁrm-level revenues and growth
rates.  These arguments have in fact been supported in many studies that
show a signiﬁcant oil effect on stock returns and volatility. 1 None
of these studies, however, have explored whether oil price dynamics
also contribute to stock market anomalies that reﬂect informational
inefﬁciencies. 
From a behavioral perspective, one can argue that oil price ﬂuctuations can affect investor sentiment, which may be particularly signiﬁcant in high oil-sensitive economies.  Such an effect on investor
sentiment, in turn, may contribute to mispricing in the stock market
in the form of stock market anomalies.  In fact, in a recent study, Ding
Name (2017) show that oil price ﬂuctuations signiﬁcantly affect investor
sentiment in the Chinese stock market without relating their ﬁndings to
stock market anomalies.  Therefore, the main contribution of this study
is to provide a novel perspective to the oil-stock market nexus by examining the predictive ability of oil price dynamics over a well-studied and
yet unresolved stock market anomaly, i. e.  the momentum anomaly, that
has been shown to persist in ﬁnancial markets (e. g.  Avramov and
Chordia, 2006.  Liu and Zhang, 2008.  Liu Name, 2011.  Wang and Xu,
2015).  Clearly, this is not only a concern from a market efﬁciency point
of view, but can also present considerable abnormal proﬁt opportunities
for active managers. 
For our empirical study, we focus on China, the second largest oil
importer globally (after the U.
