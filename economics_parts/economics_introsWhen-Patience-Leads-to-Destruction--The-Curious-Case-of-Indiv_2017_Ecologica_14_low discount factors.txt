 1.  Introduction Destructive ﬁshing is considered to be one of the most important problems in marine governance (Clark et al. , 2005.  Sethi et al. , 2005).  According to the United Nations Environment Program, about 25% of ﬁsheries worldwide are in jeopardy of collapse due to destructive ﬁshing (Shakouri et al. , 2010).  The threat of destructive ﬁshing, such as the use of poison, dynamite and illegal nets, is especially devastating for inshore ﬁsheries in tropical and developing countries where small communities are engaged in subsistence ﬁshing (Belton and Thilsted, 2014).  The collapse or even serious degradation of local ﬁsheries due to the use of destructive ﬁshing gears has a very negative impact on the material well-being of these communities.  As a result, there have been frequent attempts to persuade ﬁshers who are using destructive gears to change their behavior, and switch to more environmentallyfriendly ﬁshing gears (Samoilys et al. , 2008).  In most cases this involves policy measures, such as gear-exchange programs or monetary incentives for resource conservation (Verheij et al. , 2004).  These policies are motivated by the assumption that a major motivation for using destructive ﬁshing gear is impatience or short-sightedness (low discount factors) and the lack of availability of high capital stocks.  This assumption is based on standard economic models of renewable resources, going back to Hotelling (1931), which frame natural resource extraction as an intertemporal optimization problem, where discount factors1 indicate the value given to expected future consumption.
