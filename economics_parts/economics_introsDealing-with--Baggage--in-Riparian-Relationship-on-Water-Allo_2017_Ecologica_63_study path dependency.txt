Within the 1997 United Nations Watercourses Convention it is stated
that riparian states “may, where necessary, consider” harmonizing their
existing agreements with the principles of the convention, thus leaving
the decision whether or not to reevaluate past agreements essentially
up to riparian states (UN, 2014.  Article 3).  Yet, scholars have emphasized
that reevaluation of past agreements is rather a necessity due to pressing
economic and development needs, as well as new international agendas
(Wegerich and Olsson, 2010.  Brooks Name, 2013.  Salman, 2014.  Wouters,
2014).  Similarly, calls for reevaluation of water-sharing agreements have
been voiced in connection with growing environmental concerns and
climate change (Sanchez and Roberts, 2014.  World Economic Forum,
2015).  While there are large-scale studies on how treaties could be designed for coping best with new challenges and what mechanisms are
utilized within agreements to address changes (e. g. , Fischhendler,
2004.  Stefano Name, 2010.  Drieschova Name, 2011.  De Bruyne and
Fischhendler, 2013), there have been only a few studies systematically
showing changes in agreements due to paths taken (Pak Name, 2014. 
Soliev Name, 2015).  Adapting from the conﬂict and cooperation
continuum approach on international basins (Yoffe Name, 2003.  Zeitoun
and Mirumachi, 2008.  Sadoff and Grey, 2005), in this article contrasting
degrees of change in formal and de facto riparian water allocation are
systematically analyzed within multiple transboundary sub-basins in
the Ferghana Valley of Central Asia.  The purpose of the analysis is to identify key sources of path dependency determining various degrees of resistance to reallocation and understand how long-term dynamics
between (a) drivers of pressure and (b) sources of path dependency
can lead to various outcomes in riparian water allocation. 
Therefore, the focus is not on one agreement, but on the history of
agreements in three case studies selected using the “most similar” comparative method (Lijphart, 1971.  George and Bennett, 2005).  There is no
longitudinal comparative study with an in-depth qualitative analysis
such as this to be found in the current literature.  as Cox (2016.  230) explains, “obtaining high-quality longitudinal data relevant to the study of
human-environment interactions is frequently prohibitively expensive. ” The Ferghana Valley, shared by Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, presents an opportunity to apply such an approach, as it has a long
history of changing water agreements on a large number of small
transboundary tributaries with recent research documenting data of
great detail and depth (e. g. , Abdullaev Name, 2009.  Abdullaev and
Rakhmatullaev, 2016.  Pak Name, 2014.  Pak and Wegerich, 2014. 
Platonov Name, 2014.  SIC ICWC, 2011.  Soliev Name, 2015.  Stucker Name,
2012.  Wegerich Name, 2015.  Wegerich Name, 2016).  The early
agreements on these transboundary basins go back to the 1940s.  Although historically these small tributaries were in the same country,
the Soviet Union, due to the differences in institutional conditions related to individual tributaries, each of them has its own history of watersharing agreements.  We were particularly interested in cases where
sources of path dependency provided strong, moderate, and weak resistance to reallocate over a long period of time to understand how, under
conditions with similar pressure, established institutional arrangements
can resist reform in various ways.  To understand the differences in these
established institutional arrangements and their corresponding effects,
dynamics in allocation decisions, protocols of meetings where watersharing agreements were reached, historical correspondence, reports
on implementation, wider government documents such as laws,
decrees, and basin management schemes, as well as broader literature
reﬂecting the nature of riparian relationship in the Ferghana Valley
and Central Asia (e. g. , Bichsel, 2011.  Bucknall Name, 2003.  Djanibekov
Name, 2016.  Dukhovny and de Shutter, 2011.  FAO, 2013.  Libert Name,
2008.  O'Hara, 2000.  Sehring, 2009) were iteratively studied using an
in-depth qualitative content analysis veriﬁed with information from
key informants in the province water management departments. 
The article continues with the theoretical framework explaining the
concept and different degrees of path dependency in riparian water allocation.  Then materials and methods are presented, followed by results of
analysis and then discussion of how sources of path dependency can lead
to various outcomes.  Finally, discussion is extended to a broader signiﬁcance of the study results for the scholarship on transboundary water
management from an institutional perspective, before drawing main
conclusions in the ﬁnal section. 
2.  Path Dependency in Riparian Water Allocation. 
Path dependency has been emerging as an important concept
explaining the possibility of and the ways that a change can take place
in allocation institutions (Heinmiller, 2009.  Theesfeld and MacKinnon,
2014).  North (1990, 1994) has argued that while continuously changing
circumstances will put pressure on existing institutions and require
adoption of new solutions, historically formed path dependency in
these institutions will resist or limit the scope of changes.  More generally,
in economic literature, path dependency is explained by increasing
returns from staying on the taken path (Arthur, 1994) where sources
such as (i) high setup (and sunk) costs, (ii) learning effects, (iii) coordination effects, and (iv) adaptive expectations provide the existing institutions with so-called “positive feedback” (see for example Weber de
Morais Name, 2015 for a summary).  In addition, there are sources of
non-increasing returns that in certain combinations with signiﬁcant
ﬁxed (sunk) costs might be sufﬁcient to create path dependency or
lock-in (Arrow, 2000.  Marshall, 2005).  Among these, Kay (2005)
highlighted (i) vested interests of existing actors, (ii) network effects
from administrative capacities, and (iii) existence of formal and informal
contracts with individuals. 
Later, North (2003) reiterated that to be able to understand how a
change takes place in a complex environment and therefore to be able
to bring about successful development reforms, economists need to go
well beyond application of neoclassical concepts such as prices and markets and recognize that our choices are at all times path dependent at
least to some degree.  Within this study, path dependency is explored
as a concept that is seen as especially helpful to understand the often–
complex cross-disciplinary problems of transboundary water management.  The concept can powerfully address both the adaptability aspect
of transboundary water management, which is crucial for sustainable
management of natural resources in large-scale socio-ecological systems,
as well as the stability aspect, which is particularly important from the
perspective of sustaining constructive international relations.
