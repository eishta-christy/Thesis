 1.  Introduction Environmental sustainability, climate change and global warming have attracted increasing public awareness (Bloch et al. , 2012.  Ma, 2015).  Many countries have set and ratiﬁed nationally determined contributions in the recent Paris agreement, targeting to keep the global average temperature increase well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels.  China, who accounts for half of the world coal consumption and contributes to 25% of the world carbon dioxide emission (Energy Information Administration, 2016), in particular, sets a goal of achieving the peak before 2030, lowering the emission per unit of GDP by 60–65% from its 2005 level, and increasing the non-fossil fuel share in the primary energy consumption to 20%.  A sweeping energy evolution is called for in China since 2014 with new priority placed on environmental goals and the deployment of clean energy. 1 However, it remains a challenge to meet the goal considering the uneven distribution of energy resources and unbalanced economic growth with a high degree of inequality (Herrerias et al. , 2013.  Song and Zheng, 2012).  For China to align the long-term low carbon energy strategy with economic development goals, the central government has set and broken down the carbon and energy intensity reduction target at the level of individual provinces.  Motivated by the context characterized by heterogeneous energy strategy and economic development paths in each of these provinces, this paper addresses three main questions.  1) does energy play a role in promoting provincial growth together with the physical and human capital.  2) how and to what extent the disaggregate energy source is responsible for economic growth.  and 3) what is the causal direction between total and disaggregate energy use and growth of economy in each of these provinces, if any.
