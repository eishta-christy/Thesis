 1.  Introduction The most valuable component in South Africa's ﬁshing industry is its hake ﬁshery, which targets two species, the shallow-water (Merluccius capensis) and deep-water (M.  paradoxus) Cape hakes.  It accounts N50% of overall ﬁsheries value in the country (Butterworth and Rademeyer, 2005.  Powers et al. , 2010), with landed catch worth approximately ZAR (South African Rand) 2. 5 billion in 2008 (Petersen et al. , 2010), and is presently estimated at ±ZAR 5 billion (Durholtz, 2014, personal communication).  It also generates approximately 30,000 jobs (Rademeyer et al. , 2008a), and is estimated to comprise as much as half of all ﬁsh eaten in the country (Bacela et al. , 2003).  The largest sector of the hake ﬁshery is offshore demersal trawling, which lands 85% of the catch (Field et al. , 2013), and is an important contributor to the large post-1990 export market for South African hake (Crosoer et al. , 2006).  It is known that when ﬁsheries are managed for long-term sustainability and only the ecological context is considered, while human aspects are ignored, failure of management often results.  Therefore, the international literature generally acknowledges that ﬁsheries need to be managed with economic and social objectives in addition to ecological ones (Browman and Stergiou, 2005.  Folke et al. , 2007.  Garcia and Charles, 2008.  Pitcher and Lam, 2010).  A better understanding of the economic structure and function of the hake industry and its interaction and connection to the ecological system, will serve to inform management.  Successful actions related to sustainability are underpinned through the linkages of ecosystems to social and economic systems (Folke et al. , 2007).  Furthermore, a current scientiﬁc challenge is to ﬁnd coherence among the economic, social, ecological and institutional sectors of ﬁsheries through the utilization of all pertinent knowledge (Garcia and Charles, 2008).  As a step towards this, modelling provides a means to assist in understanding the dynamics of the economic system and identify potential links to the ecological system.
