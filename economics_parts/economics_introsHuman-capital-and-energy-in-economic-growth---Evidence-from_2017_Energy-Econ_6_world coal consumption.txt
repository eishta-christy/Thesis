 1.  Introduction Environmental sustainability, climate change and global warming have attracted increasing public awareness (Bloch et al. , 2012.  Ma, 2015).  Many countries have set and ratiﬁed nationally determined contributions in the recent Paris agreement, targeting to keep the global average temperature increase well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels.  China, who accounts for half of the world coal consumption and contributes to 25% of the world carbon dioxide emission (Energy Information Administration, 2016), in particular, sets a goal of achieving the peak before 2030, lowering the emission per unit of GDP by 60–65% from its 2005 level, and increasing the non-fossil fuel share in the primary energy consumption to 20%.  A sweeping energy evolution is called for in China since 2014 with new priority placed on environmental goals and the deployment of clean energy.
