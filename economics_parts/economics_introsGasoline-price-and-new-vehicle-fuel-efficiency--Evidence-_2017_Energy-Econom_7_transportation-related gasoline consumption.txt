Vehicles are a major source of pollution in most countries.  In
Canada, for instance, light duty vehicles generated 82 million tonnes
of greenhouse gases, approximately 12% of the countryâ€™s total emissions (Canada, 2015).  Vehicles also produce other pollutants that
adversely affect human health and well-being.  These including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter among others. 
Pollution from cars and trucks is often viewed as the archetypal
economic externality.  the costs associated with emissions accrue
to society but are not fully borne privately by drivers.  Reducing transportation-related gasoline consumption has, unsurprisingly,
become a focus of policy makers. 
An expanding array of policies have targeted vehicular emissions in Canada (Antweiler and Gulati, 2013).
