 1.  Introduction  Prior theoretical research posits that private lenders have comparative advantages over other debt market participants at  monitoring borrowers’ current and likely future compliance with ﬁnancial covenants and other loan contract terms (hereafter, “loan contract monitoring”) ( Diamond, 1984.  Fama, 1985.  Diamond, 1991 ).  Prior empirical research ﬁnds that commercial borrowers provide lenders with private information to facilitate loan contract monitoring ( Acharya and Johnson,  2007.  Bushman et al. , 2010.  Frankel et al. , 2011.  Ivashina and Sun, 2011, Massoud et al. , 2011.  Minnis and Sutherland, 2017 ).   However, with the notable exception of Minnis and Sutherland (2017) , these prior studies do not identify the speciﬁc mechanisms by which lenders obtain such information or types of information obtained.  This limits the insight provided about  how lenders obtain and use accounting-related borrower private information for monitoring, a natural question for accounting research.   We  examine  whether  lenders’  demand  for  information  for  loan  contract  monitoring  explains  the  existence  of  loan  covenants that commit borrowers to disclose accounting-related private information (hereafter, “borrower private information”) periodically after loan origination to lenders.  We also examine the effects of these covenants on the frequency of loan  contract amendments and on informed trading by lenders in secondary loan markets.  To conduct these analyses, we collect  a sample of 3309 original private loan contracts, both single-lender and syndicated loans, ﬁled as exhibits to public borrowers’ Form 10K/Q and 8K ﬁlings.  These contracts generally include a category within the aﬃrmative covenant section that  speciﬁes borrower ﬁnancial reporting covenants.  We identify two types of borrower private information speciﬁed in these  covenants.  (1) projected ﬁnancial statements for future periods (hereafter “projected ﬁnancial statements”) and (2) more  frequent than quarterly (usually monthly) and not yet publicly available historical ﬁnancial statements (hereafter, “monthly  ﬁnancial statements”).  Almost half (47%) of the loan contracts in our sample include one or both of these covenants, with  projected ﬁnancial statements being required almost twice as often as monthly ﬁnancial statements (40% versus 21% of contracts, respectively).  Despite their prevalence, to our knowledge prior researchers have not examined or even been aware of  these contractual requirements for borrowers to disclose these types of private information.   We argue that loan contracts include borrower private information covenants only when their loan contract monitoring  beneﬁts exceed their costs Lenders may receive beneﬁts from these covenants through (1) improved loan contract monitoring, (2) more eﬃcient loan contract amendment, and (3) trading on the information.  Borrowers beneﬁt to the extent  that competition induces lenders to pass along some of their beneﬁts by offering lower interest rates or other terms more  desirable to borrowers.
