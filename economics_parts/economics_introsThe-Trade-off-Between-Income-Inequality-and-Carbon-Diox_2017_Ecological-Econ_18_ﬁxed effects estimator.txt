1.  Introduction Reducing global poverty and mitigating climate change are two major challenges facing mankind in the twenty-ﬁrst century.  Economic growth leads to absolute poverty reduction, particularly if it is not associated with rising income inequality (e. g.  Dollar and Kraay, 2002.  Bourguignon, 2003).  There is a substantial literature that investigates the relationship between income and carbon dioxide emissions (the main driver behind the increase in global surface temperature).  This literature suggests that economic growth, at least up to a certain level of economic development, increases greenhouse gases (IPCC, 2014.  Jakob et al. , 2014).  Consequently, from the perspective of a developing country, economic growth may alleviate poverty, but intensify climate problems.  A related issue is whether there is also a tradeoff between income inequality and carbon emissions, as stated by Ravallion et al.  (2000).  As we discuss below, the theoretical and empirical literature generates mixed results on this question, pointing to different mechanisms and effects (for a survey see Berthe and Elie, 2015).  Much of this literature is, however, based on econometric methods that are biased in the presence of time-varying unobserved heterogeneity, and on older data on both inequality as well as emissions.  We improve upon the existing literature in both of these respects.  A particular innovation with respect to the existing literature is that we use a group ﬁxed effects estimator (Bonhomme and Manresa, 2015) as opposed to a standard ﬁxed effects estimator.  This grouped ﬁxed effects estimator takes into account that different regions of the world adopt clean technologies at different rates or face different structural challenges and dynamics.  Furthermore, the estimator arguably deals better with endogeneity due to unobserved heterogeneity.
