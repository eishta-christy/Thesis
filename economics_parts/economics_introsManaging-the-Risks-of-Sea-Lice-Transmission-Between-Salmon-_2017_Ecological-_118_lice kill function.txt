 1.  Introduction Aquaculture is a rapidly growing industry that has become a major supplier of ﬁsh and shellﬁsh to the global market (FAO, 2014).  Concern about the environmental effects of aquaculture is also growing.  The production of shrimp and salmon, two of the most lucrative and widely traded aquaculture products, is responsible for a range of environmental impacts due to the off-site effects of disease transmission, waste discharge, escapees, the use of chemicals and drugs, and the consumption of ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil (Naylor et al. , 1998).  The most important of the environmental externalities of salmon farming is the transmission of sea lice to wild ﬁsh stocks (Asche et al. , 2009.  Taranger et al. , 2015.  Lafferty et al. , 2015).  In this paper we focus on a particular disease externality of coastal salmon farms— the effect of sea lice on wild ﬁsh stocks.  This effect has been debated extensively.  Researchers agree that sea lice are one of many factors that affect wild stock levels.  However, there is disagreement about the size of the effect.  Some argue that lice are not instrumental in wild stock population decline (Marty et al. , 2010).  Others claim that where salmon net-pens provide ideal conditions for sea lice, they are the primary threat to vulnerable migrating wild juveniles (Krkošek et al. , 2006, 2007).  In both Norway and Canada, sea lice are argued to be a major threat to the sustainability of marine aquaculture and the viability of wild ﬁsheries, and are subject to strict regulations.  The generic problem in the management of wildlife disease externalities of aquaculture is the regulation of transmission risks due to contact between infected farmed stocks and susceptible wild stocks (Conrad and Rondeau, 2015.  Fischer et al. , 2015, 2016).  The mitigation of disease risk requires reduction in either the infection rate of farmed stocks or contact between farmed and wild stocks.  In the case of marine salmon aquaculture, the infection rate of farmed ﬁsh may be reduced by chemical controls.  Since farmed ﬁsh stocks have a reservoir-host effect on disease transmission, this also affects disease transmission to wild ﬁsh stocks.  From a social perspective, salmon farmers should ideally take account of the costs incurred by wild capture ﬁsheries when deciding how much in-farm disease control to apply.  Nor is the disease of wild salmon the only off-site effect to consider.  It may, for instance, change the structure and distribution of other species within the system (Burge et al. , 2014).  Since disease is an external cost of salmon production, however, it will not be considered in the absence of regulatory, property-rights, or tax-based initiatives by a ﬁshery authority.  This study focuses on the optimal management of sea lice externalities between salmon aquaculture and wild salmon ﬁsheries that run in both directions.  Sea lice are native ectoparasite copepods, common on wild adult salmon.  The salmon louse (L.  salmonis) has a free-living phase and a parasitic phase in its approximately 2-month life cycle (Frazer, 2009).  Once attached to salmon, lice feed on mucous, blood, and skin which causes both morbidity and mortality of salmon (Costello, 2006).  When wild stocks migrate to a fresh water environment in the fall for spawning, lice from wild stocks disperse into ﬁsh farms located on the migration route of wild stocks and infest the farmed ﬁsh.  If not treated in the farms, the lice grow rapidly and reinfest wild juveniles when they emigrate into marine environment in the early summer.  Although the disease problem associated with ﬁsh farms is widely recognized, there are few estimates of the ecological and economic impacts on both farmed and wild ﬁsheries.  One estimate is that sea lice may cost the salmon industry US$480 million a year or 6% of product value (Costello, 2009).  Currently, salmon farms control lice with in-food chemical such as emamectin benzoate (SLICE) with high efﬁcacy to control all stages of sea lice (Stone et al. , 2000), and with cleaner ﬁsh such as wrasse or lumpﬁsh.  These controls have different cost effectiveness (Liu and Bjelland, 2014), also sea lice may develop resistance to SLICE (McEwan et al. , 2015).  To analyze this problem we develop a bioeconomic model that incorporates epidemiological, ecological, and economic elements.  As in prior studies of wildlife disease management that employ an optimal control framework (Gramig et al. , 2009.  Horan et al. , 2010), we treat the level of disease control as endogenous.  Speciﬁcally, we integrate sea lice population dynamics in an economic model of salmon production to determine the optimal control policy—ﬁrst from the perspective of salmon aquaculture producer, and then from the perspective of a joint ﬁsheries manager.  By taking account of the complex relationship between sea lice populations in farmed and wild ﬁsheries, we are able to assess the economic impact of salmon aquaculture on the wild ﬁshery due to sea lice transmission.  While our model is calibrated on the pink salmon ﬁshery in Paciﬁc Canada, our approach can readily be applied to the management of the disease effects of aquaculture on wild ﬁsheries more generally.  The structure of the paper is as follows.  Section 2 describes various components of sea lice-salmon interactions in aquaculture.  Section 3 presents a bioeconomic model of farmed and wild ﬁsheries.  The main results and the outcome of numerical simulations are presented in Section 4.  This is followed by sensitivity analysis provided in Section 5.  Finally, Section 6 discusses the results and draws conclusions.  <Middle> A Model of Sea Lice-salmon Interactions in Aquaculture.  2. 1.  Sea Lice Dynamics.  We consider a coastal area in which an Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farm (or a coordinated aquaculture industry consisting of many farms) is connected by the free-living stage of sea lice transmission with wild pink salmon stocks when they migrate into or out of spawning rivers.  The farm manager releases salmon smolts (Ff,0) into ﬁsh farms just before wild adults head home for spawning.  Fish farmers either employ batch harvesting at ﬁxed intervals to target speciﬁc markets, or employ graded harvesting during the whole grow-out season.  Aquaculture salmon production has a production cycle between 1. 5 and 2. 5 years (Asche et al. , 2009).  In this study we assume that production involves ﬁxed interval batch harvesting-all ﬁsh are harvested 24 months after being released.  We divide sea lice growth into a free-living copepodite phase and an adult lice phase.  Sea lice cannot survive in a fresh water environment.  Due to the relatively brief spawning migration (August and September) of wild pink salmon from marine environment to fresh water environment, gravid lice from homecoming wild adult stocks would infest farmed stocks by spreading copepodite produced by gravid lice (Lw , t).  Copepodites have a probability of ρ to attach to farmed (Ff , t) or wild (Fw , t) hosts if present in coastal waters.  They then survive to adult lice stage with probability ψt depending on environmental factors, such as salinity and water temperature (Tucker et al. , 2000).  Settlement success ψt is assumed to be periodically forced, and takes the form.  This simple sinusoidal function generates a 12 month periodicity to infections, t = 1, 2…12, and has a seasonal force impact coefﬁcient of ε2 and a base settlement success of ε1.  When migrating wild juveniles pass by ﬁsh farms close to wild migratory routes from May to July they are subject to lice infestation.  Wild juveniles are vulnerable because of their small size, and also because that they are subject to the environmental stress caused by the transition from fresh water to marine environment.  We assume that the chemical treatment ut, if applied, kills both adult sea lice and copepodites on farmed ﬁsh.  The mortality rate associated with chemical treatment for copepodites and adult sea lice is denoted by k and z, respectively.  2. 2.  A Well-mixed Coastal Environment.  The hydrodynamic environment is one of the main factors affecting the dynamics of sea lice transmission (Adams et al. , 2012).  Two different environments are considered here.  First, we consider a coastal environment in which copepodites are well-mixed (Ashander et al. , 2012), implying that copepodite density is the same across the whole area including the farm system.  In what follows, subscript f denotes farmed stock, subscript w denotes wild stock, and subscript t denotes time (measured in months).  If Xt denotes total copepodite abundance in the coastal area at time t, and Lf,t denotes lice abundance in the farm, then a discrete model for sea lice dynamics in farm is this.  The dynamics of copepodite and lice populations are described by Eqs.  (2) and (3).  They are similar to a discrete-time version of the canonical Anderson-May host parasite model (Anderson and May, 1978).  Eq.  (2) describes the dynamics of copepodites in the coastal area.  The ﬁrst term on the right hand side (RHS) is the number of copepodites produced by lice on farmed Lf,t and gravid lice Lw,t which is equal to zero when there are no adult wild stocks in the coastal area.  Copepodite production is taken to be at the constant rate, λ.  Fw,t denotes the abundance of wild juveniles at the end of month t.  The second term has three components.  The ﬁrst component, Xt(1−ρ(Ff,t+Fw,t)), is total copepodite abundance after dispersal and attachment to ﬁsh host.  Copepodites are assumed to attach to hosts at the rate ρ.  The second component is the surviving proportion after natural mortality of ξ and the third component is copepodite mortality due to chemical treatment, fc(ut−2,ut−1,ut), the control being included in feed.  Copepodite transmission between farmed and wild ﬁsh only happens during the spawning migration of wild adults and the emigration of juvenile wild stocks.  Because sea lice cannot survive in a fresh water environment we assume that in this well-mixed system copepodites do not attach to wild spawning adults.  However, wild juveniles will be infested when they migrate into the ocean.  Eq.  (3) gives the total lice abundance in the farm at the beginning of each time unit (month) as the sum of the newly mature adults and the lice remaining from last period after natural mortality and the effects of chemical control.  The ﬁrst term on the RHS of Eq.  (3) is the number of copepodites attached to hosts that become adult, the survival rate being ψt.  The second term on the RHS is the number of lice remaining from last period.  There are four components in this term.  The ﬁrst component is the total lice number at the beginning of the period, the second component (1 − v) is the proportion surviving after natural mortality v.  The third one is the proportional change in the lice due to mortality between Ff,t+1 and Ff,t.  We assume that if 10% of ﬁsh are killed, 10% of adult lice will also be killed.  If all ﬁsh are harvested, then all lice will be killed in the process.  The last component, fl(ut −2,ut− 1, ut), is the lice kill function due to chemical treatment.  The efﬁcacy of chemical treatment varies depending on sea location, lice genetics, and water temperature (Stone et al.
