A growing body of research considers the role of sentiment in financial decisions.  In common usage, the term sentiment
refers to feelings or beliefs about a situation, state of affairs, or event.  Applied in the finance and accounting literature,
however, the term sentiment more narrowly depicts beliefs that are unjustified based on available information (e. g. , Baker
and Wurgler, 2007).  While evidence indicates economic data justify the majority of beliefs about the state of the economy
(e. g. , Lemmon and Portniaguina, 2006), research shows that sentiment has meaningful effects in both asset pricing and
corporate decision-making settings.  For example, Baker and Wurgler (2006) find sentiment is associated with return reversals in stocks that are difficult to value and arbitrage, though the effects are less evident in highly competitive and liquid
markets where investors can arbitrage away security mispricing and discipline the potential effects of psychological biases. 
Importantly, corporate decision making settings lack an easily accessible arbitrage mechanism to discipline biased decisions,
increasing the likelihood that sentiment will affect individual decisions, especially in settings of high uncertainty (Bloomfield, 2010).  Consequently, behavioral forces acting on individuals have the ability to influence the behavior of institutions in
predictable ways.  Indeed, prior research indicates that sentiment affects analysts’ estimates (Clement Name, 2011; Hribar and
McInnis, 2012), institutional investors’ portfolio allocations (Cornell Name, 2014), and managers’ pro-forma earnings disclosures (Brown Name, 2012). 
In this study, we investigate whether managerial sentiment – managers’ unjustified beliefs about future firm outcomes – is
associated with errors in accrual estimates.  Accrual estimates require managerial judgment and estimation about expected
future realizations.  The inherent uncertainty in future outcomes allows for both strategic discretion and unintentional errors in
accrual estimates.  Consistent with the aforementioned research showing that decisions of sophisticated individuals exhibit
sentiment in settings of uncertainty, we posit that managerial sentiment may lead to errors in accrual estimates, where
managers’ over (under) optimism results in accrual estimates that are too low (high). 
To study our research question, we examine bank managers’ estimates of the loan loss provision.  In the banking setting,
managerial beliefs that are unjustifiably optimistic (pessimistic) could lead to under (over) estimation of future charge-offs
and thus a negative association between managerial sentiment and the loan loss provision.  The loan loss provision is a
particularly well-suited accrual for detecting the potential effect of sentiment on accrual estimates for three reasons.  First,
the loan loss provision is the most significant and economically important accrual in the banking industry.  Second, available
data on loan accounts allow us to observe the economic realization (i.
