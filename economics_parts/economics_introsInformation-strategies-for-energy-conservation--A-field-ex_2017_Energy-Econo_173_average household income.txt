Strategies that provide information about the environmental impact
of activities are increasingly seen as an effective way to encourage conservation behavior (Evans Name, 2009).  The environmental impact of
everyday activities is often invisible to consumers who cannot gauge
the impact of their actions.  Information strategies that aim to correct
this information asymmetry are increasingly common (Foulon Name,
2002.  Kennedy Name, 1994).  These include mercury and air pollution
advisories (Cutter and Neidell, 2009.  Shimshack and Ward, 2010. 
Shimshack Name, 2007.  Zivin and Neidell, 2009).  mandatory and
voluntary corporate disclosure (Bennear and Olmstead, 2008.  Delmas
Name, 2010.  Evans Name, 2009.  Khanna, 2001.  Konar and Cohen, 1997. 
Lyon and Maxwell, 2007.  Powers Name, 2011) and ecolabels (Hallstein
and Villas-Boas, 2013.  Teisl Name, 2002).  Such strategies are based on
the principle that more and better information about the environmental
impact of activities will encourage consumers to conserve. 
Electricity conservation has been an especially active context
for the deployment of information strategies.  Electricity and heat generation accounts for over 40% of greenhouse gases across the world
(International Energy Agency, 2014) and effective conservation programs could contribute to signiﬁcant environmental improvements.  A
large number of energy conservation experiments have been conducted using various information strategies to reduce energy use
(Allcott, 2011.  Allcott and Rogers, 2014.  Asensio and Delmas, 2015. 
Delmas and Lessem, 2014.  Jessoe and Rapson, 2014).  These include
providing users with energy saving tips, historical individual usage,
real time energy usage, peer usage, etc.  Meta-analyses of these ﬁeld
experiments ﬁnd these strategies to be effective for conservation
(Delmas Name, 2013), although effectiveness varies with the type of
message provided. 
However, until very recently (McRae, 2015.  Pellerano Name 2015),
there have been no ﬁeld experiments in developing countries that focus
on information strategies for energy conservation behavior.  Indeed, a recent meta-analysis based on 156 ﬁeld trials published in peer-reviewed
journals from 1975 to 2012 found that 100% of the studies were conducted in developed countries, mostly Europe and the United States (Delmas
Name, 2013).  Developing countries differ in many characteristics from developed countries, including income and education levels, and information technology infrastructure, and it is unclear how energy information
strategies would perform in such contexts.  For example, conducting
ﬁeld experiments in developing countries could allow researchers to provide meaningful monetary gains and losses with the same amount that
would be considered trivial in developed countries (Harrison and List,
2004.  Kachelmeier and Shehata, 1992.  Slonim and Roth, 1998). 1 At the
same time, the demographic stratiﬁcation of developing countries is
changing rapidly, with an increase share of middle classes with higher income levels.  For example, the middle class population of India is estimated at 267 million individuals and to double to 547 million individuals by
2026. 2 We still know little about the attitudes of these middle class
households towards energy conservation and how to best engage them
in conservation behavior (Mawdsley, 2004).  Some have described middle
classes as particularly responsive to environmental issues because they
have inherited a culture of conservation due to scarcity of resources
(Vyas, 2012).  Others have suggested that middle class exhibit a lack of
concern about the public good because they are swept into the global
frenzy of consumption (Gidwani and Reddy, 2011).  So it is unclear how
middle class households in developing countries will engage with information about energy conservation and act on it. 
Since the majority of the growth in energy demand over the next
few decades will come from the developing world (Wolfram Name,
2012), and because of the rapid growth of middle class households,
identifying cost-effective strategies for promoting energy conservation
behavior for the middle class in these countries could have a profound
impact on greenhouse gas emissions. 
In this study, we contribute to the energy conservation behavior
literature by conducting a ﬁeld experiment on electricity conservation
behavior in urban India.  In recent years, India has emerged as one
of the fastest growing economies of the world, entailing an equally
rapid increase in energy consumption (Balachandra Name, 2010).  The
estimated electricity consumption in India was of 882,592 GWh in
2013, showing an annual growth rate of 9% since 2006 (Government
of India, 2015).  India's consumption of energy is now the fourth largest
in the world, behind China, the U. S and Russia (IEA, 2012).  Although
the Indian economy is gradually becoming more energy efﬁcient,
India is still among the least energy efﬁcient countries in the world
(Balachandra Name, 2010). 
Most importantly, electricity generation is a major source of air
pollution in India (Guttikunda Name, 2013), since 66% of the electricity
generation is derived from coal power plants (Guttikunda and Jawahar,
2014). 3 The pollution from these plants resulted in an estimated
80,000–115,000 premature deaths and N20 million asthma cases from
exposure to total particulate matter (PM) 2. 5 pollution (Guttikunda
and Jawahar, 2014).  Because of the signiﬁcant health impact of electricity generation in India, we decided to conduct a randomized ﬁeld
experiment to test how motivations on the health impact of energy
use motivate consumers to conserve electricity as compared to more
conventional monetary motivations to conserve. 
Buildings in India account for N30% (264,778 GWh) of overall
energy consumption and residential building are responsible for 93%
(246,243 GWh) of building energy consumption (Batra Name, 2013. 
CEA, 2012).  Indian residential energy use is expected to increase by
around 65–75% in 2050 compared to 2005 (Van Ruijven Name, 2011). 
The urban population constitutes about a third of the total population
and a major share of the residential energy consumption (Chaturvedi
Name, 2014).  Studying middle class urban households is particularly important because research shows that the impact of urbanization on
emissions is more pronounced in the middle-income group than in
the other income groups (Poumanyvong and Kaneko, 2010).  We therefore focus our research on identifying the most effective information
strategies for energy conservation behavior in the residential sector
for urban middle class households. 
We replicated the methodology used in a randomized ﬁeld experiment conducted in the U. S.  by Asensio and Delmas (2015, 2016).  We
provided real-time, smart metering energy feedback to 19 Indian
households over an academic year, to test the effectiveness of two
different messaging strategies based either on the environmental
and health impacts of electricity consumption, or on the monetary
savings of reducing electricity consumption.  While our sample size
was relatively small, our advanced energy metering system enabled
us to collect high frequency data with the statistical power necessary
to detect changes in energy consumption behaviors.  This aspect
of our energy metering system is remarkable as low technology
electricity infrastructure as often been the main barrier to conduct
energy information experiments in developing countries.  Indeed, in
India, electriﬁcation rates are low, and the electricity grid frequently
fails to provide a reliable supply of power when people need it
(Urpelainen, 2014). 
Furthermore, our system allowed us to identify participants' level
of engagement with the treatment messages.  Namely how many
times participants actually read the messages we sent them and how
many times they visited their personalized electricity usage dashboard. 
This feature allows us to assess the effect of the actual treatment,
speciﬁcally when people access their energy feedback information,
rather than just measuring the effect of the intent to treat, that is
to say sending the email or making the information available on
the dashboard.  This contrasts with previous energy conservation messaging strategies that relied mostly on “intent to treat” study designs
(Schultz Name, 2007.  Allcott, 2011).  This method also allows us to
measure the link between engagement with the information and conservation behavior. 
Our results show that non-monetary messages that framed electricity
consumption in terms of environmental and health impacts were more
effective than monetary messages that framed electricity consumption
in terms of ﬁnancial savings.  Households in the environmental/health
treatment group were more engaged with their electricity feedback,
and reduced their electricity usage by 18. 4% relative to the control
group, while households in the monetary group did not make signiﬁcant changes in their usage throughout the 12 weeks of the experiment
relative to the control group.  These revealed preferences provide stark
contrast to the stated preferences disclosed in a survey of 1820 residents of urban India, in which survey participants identiﬁed monetary
savings, not health protection, as their main motivation for energy
conservation. 
Our ﬁndings illustrate the advantage of ﬁeld experimental techniques to reveal conservation behavior and the potential for nonmonetary information strategies for encouraging energy conservation
behavior in developing countries. 
The failure to engage in energy efﬁciency has been characterized as a
market failure associated with imperfect information.  individuals lack
the relevant information or knowledge to engage in energy saving
behaviors (Golove and Eto, 1996.  Brown, 2001.  Gillingham Name, 2009)
and acquiring such information is costly.  One potentially effective informational tool is the provision of frequent feedback to consumers regarding their energy usage.  Such information can allow consumers to
better understand when and how they are using electricity, and help
them improve energy usage decisions (Fischer, 2008).  Being reminded
of energy usage periodically may also help trigger conservation activities by making energy usage more salient. 
Conservation strategies based on energy feedback and information
increase individual awareness of the issues and of the possibilities to inﬂuence the problem.  However, they do not automatically lead to energy
conservation behavior.  Once individuals have this information, they
weigh the beneﬁts versus the cost of their actions before deciding to engage in conservation.  Information strategies can focus on different types
of motivations of behavior, such as for example pecuniary motivations
or moral payoffs.  Yet, it is unclear which strategies are more effective
depending on the context in which they are implemented.  Furthermore,
bounded rationality suggests that consumers are rational but face cognitive constraints in processing information that lead to deviations from
rationality in certain circumstances (Gillingham Name, 2009.  Yoeli
Name 2017).  Thus the need to investigate the effectiveness of different
information framing for energy conservation. 
2. 1.  Pecuniary strategies. 
Pecuniary strategies represent a set of strategies commonly used in
conservation behavior studies.  Lowered energy use results in ﬁnancial
beneﬁts to households that pay their own electricity bills.  Individuals
should be expected to take up energy conservation as long as the beneﬁts of doing so are larger than the costs. 
Many energy conservation experiments inform participants about
the ﬁnancial expenses and/or savings potential associated with their energy usage (see Delmas Name, 2013 for a review).  Some studies found
strong effects of price signals on the timing of electricity consumption
(Faruqui Name, 2010.  Newsham and Bowker, 2010), or total energy consumption (Gillingham Name, 2009.  Ito Name, 2015), demonstrating that
price signals affect behavior.  However, other studies indicate that pecuniary incentives might be counterproductive for energy conservation
because they might crowd out more altruistic or prosocial motivations
(Bénabou and Tirole, 2006.  Bowles, 2008).  Furthermore, pecuniary
strategies might not be effective if the monetary incentives are small. 
The literature is therefore divided on the effectiveness of pecuniary
strategies for energy conservation. 
2. 2.  Moral payoffs. 
There is a rich literature on the importance of moral payoffs and social norms on household consumption decisions.  Research has shown
that normative strategies can motivate human behavior in the interests
of the long-term beneﬁts of the social group rather than the short-term,
self-interested behavior of the individual (Nolan Name, 2008). 
Learning that one's marginal consumption imposes social costs on
others can lead to different moral sensitivities to the health impact on
others.  Research suggests that disclosing environment and healthbased externalities to consumers can be effective at shifting conservation preferences by increasing the perceived moral beneﬁts of conservation (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008).  However, health motivations differ
from purely moral motivations since conservation provide not only
health beneﬁts to others, but also potential health beneﬁts to the individual taking the conservation action. 
Asensio and Delmas (2015, 2016) studied the effectiveness of monetary savings and environmental and health messaging strategies on energy conservation behavior in the U. S.  They conducted a randomized
controlled trial in 118 apartments in Los Angeles over 8 months and
found that environment and health-based information treatments motivated 8% energy savings versus control, and were particularly effective
on families with children, who achieved up to 19% energy savings.  They
did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant impact on energy conservation of a message
on monetary savings.  However, it is unclear how such information
strategies would work when implemented in a developing country.  For
example, because monetary gains in developing countries might be a
more salient motivation than in developed countries, we might expect
framing based on monetary savings to be a more effective strategy
(Harrison and List, 2004). 
Indeed, cultural attitudes toward energy conservation might differ
in developing countries from those in developed countries and lead
to different responses to information.  In India, for example, some
have argued that people living in urban areas have a culture of ‘deep
conservation’, where conservation is a learned habit due to scarcity
of resources (Shrinivasan Name, 2013), and that the potential for conservation has already been tapped.  This is in contrast to conservation attitudes observed in developed countries (Brounen Name, 2013).  In order
to explore attitudes towards energy conservation in India, a door-todoor survey of 1820 residents of urban India was conducted in 2013
(Batra Name, 2013). 4 The goal of this survey was to better understand
the motivations to conserve energy as well as opinions about the use
of information technologies for conservation.  Middle- and highincome households in urban India were chosen as the focus population
because they have access to electricity and own multiple types of appliances, allowing for various conservation strategies. 5
Among other things, each participant was asked how often they
engage in speciﬁc energy conservation behaviors as well as their motivations for engaging in those behaviors.  The most common action to
conserve electricity was unplugging appliances, with 86% of respondents stating they always or often engage in this behavior.  This was
followed by turning off the air conditioner (81%), buying energy efﬁcient appliances (80%), turning off lights (67%), and changing appliance
settings (55%). 
We were particularly interested in the motivations for taking speciﬁc
actions to reduce electricity consumption.  The responses from this survey are summarized in Table 1.  Health was among the least common
motivation for almost every energy conservation behavior.  Overall, for
respondents that always or often engage in energy conservation behaviors, 84% cited saving money as a motivation and 43% cited habits.  Only
9% of respondents cited the health of themselves or their family as a motivating factor for engaging in energy conservation. 6 For example, regarding unplugging appliances, as shown in Table 1, out of the households
who unplug appliances always or often, 70% said they do so to save
money, whereas 29% did so out of habit.  Only 0. 6% of these households
unplugged their appliances because of health concerns. 
The relatively low percentage of respondents who indicated health
as a motivation for energy conservation was quite surprising since energy production in India is a major cause of air pollution.  This might
indicate a lack of understanding of the link between energy use, the
generation of electricity, and its associated air pollution.  Most studies
tend to show low awareness of the health impact of air pollution and
low understanding of how electricity is generated (Dunlap Name, 1993. 
Bickerstaff, 2004.  Lee Name, 2015).  Although existing studies tend to be
focused on North America, Europe and Japan.  One survey of 1724 respondents in India showed that while 78% were quite aware of the air
pollution in their locality, very few respondents could identify the
cause of air pollution. 
Based on the motivations from the survey, we would expect that information about monetary savings would be more effective to drive
conservation behavior than information about health beneﬁts since
monetary motivations were cited more often than health motivations. 
However, research shows that there is often a gap between intentions
and behavior.  Thus this importance of conducting
a ﬁeld experiment. 
<Middle> Methodology. 
While the survey is useful to gather information about energy conservation attitudes, it is limited in its ability to assess real conservation
behavior.  In order to test the effectiveness of monetary and nonmonetary information strategies on electricity conservation behavior in
India, we conducted a randomized controlled ﬁeld experiment in a modern faculty apartment building located at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT-D) in New Delhi. 
Our data includes 375,805 ﬁfteen-minute electricity readings from
19 households over an academic year.  Our ﬁeld experiment, while
small in size, takes advantage of two randomized treatment groups
and a control group, high-frequency electricity data, detailed personalized electricity feedback, and knowledge of each participant's engagement with their electricity consumption feedback.  This experimental
design allowed us to test the impact of information strategies on energy
conservation as well as the impact engagement with energy usage information has on conservation. 
In one treatment, households received energy feedback messages
describing the additional cost of their energy consumption in comparison to their most efﬁcient neighbors.  In the other treatment, households
received feedback about their consumption in the metric of reduced air
pollution emissions rather than as dollar costs to the household.  That is,
one group received information about how energy efﬁciency was serving their self-interest, and the other about how energy efﬁciency was
contributing to the common good of reduced air pollution.  The control
group didn't receive energy feedback messages. 
own electricity bills, our experimental results therefore represent
outcomes of real-life consumptions decisions in their natural settings. 
Second, apartments are standardized across the building with the
same size and layout.  This helps to control for differences in infrastructure to isolate energy use behavior.  Third, our experimental design required the installation of an energy monitoring system that could
record and process electricity usage, as well as distribute this information to participants on a web-based dashboard.  Choosing a modern
faculty housing complex on the IIIT-D campus ensured that 1) the infrastructure was in place that allowed the monitoring system to be
installed, 2) there was an engineer on site that could immediately troubleshoot any issues with the system, and 3) the study participants
would have internet access in their apartments and have the opportunity to view and interact with the treatment messages. 
The apartment building was built in 2012 and consists of 28 individual faculty apartment units.  In summer 2013, we sent an email to
the faculty members in these apartments to describe the experiment
and provided a link for each household to complete the consent
process and entry survey. 9 Of the 28 households that were contacted,
19 (68%) agreed to participate in the study.  To test for differences in average electricity consumption for the participants and non-participants,
electricity consumption data were collected for all apartments in the
complex.  no statistically signiﬁcant differences were found for the participating and non-participating households (P-value = 0. 86). 
Each apartment has three bedrooms and three bathrooms and is approximately 1700 square feet. 10 While individual appliances present in
each apartment are not directly observable, the typical apartment includes multiple room-level air conditioners, a refrigerator, water heater,
microwave, lights, fans, a television, and a computer.  At the beginning of
the study, each of the 19 participating households completed a brief survey that asked for basic household demographic information.  Summary
statistics for these demographics are presented in Table 2.  Of the 19
households in the sample, 31. 6% have children.  The typical apartment
has two adults with approximately 84% having a male head of household.  While not shown in Table 2, the average household income for
all of the participants is approximately 125,000–170,000 Rupees
per month and their average monthly electric bill is approximately
1551 Rupees per month. 11 We recognize that our participating households are more educated and have higher income levels than the average
household in India.
