Crude oil is widely considered to be one of the most important
commodities affecting global economic growth.  Estimates indicate
that the oil and gas drilling sector makes up about three percent of
global GDP, and imports of petroleum products account for about
forty percent of U. S.  trade deﬁcits. 1 Movements in crude prices have
been shown to signiﬁcantly impact the world economy at various
levels, from family budgets to corporate earnings and to the national
economy (cf.  Eika and Magnussen, 2000.  Kilian, 2009).  According
to IMF, a 10% increase in oil prices results in a 0. 2% drop in global
GDP.  Therefore, when oil prices reached a record high $145/bbl in
2008, and then began to drop sharply beginning 2014 and reaching a
low $29/bbl in early 2016, this resulted in signiﬁcant revenue shortfalls and economic stress on many energy exporting nations such
as Russia and Saudi Arabia.  On the other hand, the availability of
cheaper oil has been hailed as a potent economic stimulus to many
net oil importer countries such as China and India, while keeping
inﬂation under check. 
Given the central role of oil in the economy there is a great deal of
attention in the literature in forecasting crude prices.  According to a
recent Wall Street Journal article, “forecasting is always an inexact art,
particularly for oil, a global industry with wildly uneven data. . . it is a
crucial one, underpinning companies’ decisions about when to drill
and how much to hedge” and importantly, “market watchers get this
so wrong. ”
One of the most watched oil price forecast is from the US
Energy Information Administration (EIA), which formally constructs
monthly and quarterly forecasts of the price of crude oil at horizons up to two years. 3 Although EIA’s short-term forecasts help
inform corporate investment and guide resource deployment decisions, their forecasts are hard to replicate and sometimes not very
accurate.  The diﬃculty for replication is due to the lack of available detail information about the forecasting methodology.  There are
many examples of forecasting inaccuracy.  For instance, EIA reported
a price projection of about $28/bbl in 2010, yet the actual average
price for oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 2010
was $79. 61/bbl.  Ironically, right before the sharp fall of oil prices in
the middle of 2014, EIA raised its 2014 forecast on WTI crude-oil
prices to nearly $96/bbl. 4 In a letter defending the veracity of EIA
reports, Howard Gruenspecht, deputy administrator of the EIA, commented that, “EIA does not characterize any of its long run projection
scenarios as a forecast. ”5
Futures-based forecasts provide a market-based expectation of
oil prices.  Although in principle the futures market should be a good
predictor of future spot prices, this is not supported by empirical
evidence.  Alquist and Kilian (2010) document that oil futures prices
tend to be less accurate in the mean-squared prediction error sense
than a simple no-change forecast (which posit that oil prices will be
the same tomorrow as they are today). 
Various econometric approaches have been proposed to forecast oil prices.  For example, in an attempt to improve forecasting
performance, Pindyck (1999) adds a mean reversion term to a deterministic linear trend model.  Radchenko (2005) applies a shifting
trend model with an autoregressive process in error terms instead of
the white noise process.  Still others apply ARIMA models to forecast
the monthly WTI crude oil prices.  However, such forecasting methods have not been particularly successful when compared with the
naive no-change forecast (see Hamilton, 2009.  Alquist and Kilian,
2010.  Alquist Name, 2013).  Overall, conclusions from prior studies
suggest that changes in oil prices are inherently unpredictable and
diﬃcult to model, and as a result the current price of oil may be the
best available forecast of future prices. 
Given the challenges faced by past forecasting approaches it
would be important to understand why oil prices are so hard to
predict.  The literature provides interesting insights (cf.  Hamilton,
2009).  Crude oil prices are driven by a large set of dynamic and
multi-dimensional factors including physical markets factors, ﬁnancial markets factors and trading factors that are themselves often
hard to predict, and may also have counteracting effects.  Perfect foresight is also hindered due to unexpected demand shifts in the global
economy, supply disruptions, changes in oil production and inventory demand, geopolitical events, among other factors.  These types
of events create uncertainty about future supply or demand, which
can lead to higher volatility in prices.  Of course, accidental events
such as reﬁnery outages or pipeline problems adds to the unpredictability.  Therefore, in accounting for the history of past oil supply
and demand shocks emanating from various events, market participants are always assessing the possibility of future events and their
potential impact on prices.  In addition to the size and duration of a
potential disruption, agents also consider the current stock levels and
the ability of producers to offset a potential supply/demand shock. 
Furthermore, the forward-looking behavior of speculators and the
quantiﬁcation of speculative oil demand shocks can, at times, invalidate standard econometric models if speculators respond to information not available to the econometrician attempting to disentangle
demand and supply shocks based on historical data (Kilian and Lee,
2014).  Confounding this challenge, it is also diﬃcult to relate changes
in real oil prices to macroeconomic outcomes due to the presence of
reverse causality from macro aggregates to oil prices (see Barsky and
Kilian, 2002.  Kilian, 2009.  Chatrath Name, 2016). 
These challenges not withstanding, forecasting efforts have not
entirely been in vain.  Researchers report success by expanding the
range of explanatory factors and integrating them into their models. 
Dees Name (2007) model oil prices as a function of oil inventories and demand, OPEC production, producer quotas and production
capacity.  Ewing and Thompson (2007) focus on the relationship
between macroeconomic variables and crude oil prices, and ﬁnd
oil prices to be procyclical - i. e. , leading consumer prices but lagging industrial production activities.  Kaufmann Name (2008) study
the potential effect of reﬁnery utilization rate on crude oil prices
and show that lower reﬁnery rates correspond with higher crude
oil prices.  In adding to this mix, the role of speculation and forward
looking behavior in crude oil prices has been carefully examined by
various authors.  Sari Name (2011) use the VIX index as a proxy for
global risk and ﬁnd that oil prices are inﬂuenced by related commodities.  Coleman (2012) ﬁnds positive relationships between crude
oil prices and proxies for speculative and terrorist activities while
controlling for fundamental and market parameters.  More recently,
Miao Name (forthcoming) report how crude oil inventory announcements impact oil futures and options prices.  There is also some
evidence that forecasting models based on economic fundamentals
work better at shorter horizons (up to 3 months).  whereas, models
based on the crack spread work better at longer horizons (between
12 and 24 months).  Baumeister and Kilian (2015) present a combination approach with six different models that marginally improves the
forecasting performance in comparison to the no-change forecast. 
This paper contributes to the literature by using a relatively
new methodology that optimally selects among various factors that
underlie crude oil price movements.  In aiding our investigation, we
consider a wide range of potential explanatory factors that are popularly associated with oil prices.  Our analysis employs weekly data,
and for expository purposes classiﬁes variables along six broad factor
dimensions.  supply, demand, ﬁnancial market, commodities market,
speculative, and political factors.  Speciﬁcally, we employ the Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method to generate out-of-sample forecasts.  Our results indicate that the LASSO
method yields superior forecasts, as observed by reductions in the
mean squared prediction error relative to various benchmark models
such as the the no-change forecast, EIA projections and futures market predictions.  The results also provide insights into the temporal
relationship between various inﬂuential factors and crude oil prices. 6
The remainder of the study is organized as follows.  Section 2 provides an overview of the data used in the study and establishes the
economic importance of variables that determine oil prices.  The various forecasting models and approaches are described in Section 3,
followed by discussion of empirical results in Section 4.  Section 5
concludes the paper. 
<Middle> Components of the crude oil price forecasting models. 
We use the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot prices
as the dependent variable, and 26 potential determinants or predictors
that are classified into six broad groups.  The description, sample
frequency and data source for each variable are shown in Table 1. 7
Our data spans the period from January 04, 2002 to September
25, 2015.  The model is estimated over various ﬁxed length rolling
windows (5, 6 and 7 years), which minimizes the odds of generating spurious regression estimates.  Table 1 provides a list of various
factors, corresponding descriptions and data source. 
2. 1.  Supply factors. 
It is commonly believed that oil is an exhaustible resource.  We
consider the following supply factors.  1) Global crude oil production. 
The global crude oil production includes both OPEC and non-OPEC
production.  The production of crude oil is often subject to geopolitical developments, as well as factors such as weather-related events,
exploration and production (E&P) costs, investments and innovations.  According to 2014 estimates, OPEC member countries control
81% of the world’s crude oil reserves, with the bulk of OPEC oil
reserves being in the Middle East, amounting to around 66% of the
OPEC total. 8 The non-OPEC members also play an increasingly important role.  According to EIA, non-OPEC members represent about 60%
of world oil production in 2015. 9 2) Global crude oil export.  Global
crude oil export can be viewed as an additional measure of global
crude oil production.  Whereas, the former set of variables provide
a direct picture of supply, this measures the potential capacity for
(excess) supply.  Hallock Name (2004) show a strong relationship
between the conventional oil production and the available export for
the world.  3) OPEC surplus crude oil production capacity.  According to
EIA, the surplus crude oil production capacity by OPEC nations is a
useful indicator of general market supply conditions.  Excess production capacity tends to stabilize global markets, and helps mitigate
supply disruptions that can occur from time to time.  4) Crude oil
inventory.  Several studies examine the role of crude oil inventory on
prices (see, for example Hamilton, 2009.  Kilian and Murphy, 2014). 
The accumulation of crude oil stock permits greater ﬂexibility in
responding to short-term supply shortages. 10 We include both the
global crude oil closing stock and the U. S.  crude oil inventory in
our forecast.  5) U. S.  reﬁnery utilization rate.  Kaufmann Name (2008)
ﬁnd that the reﬁning rate plays an important role in determining
crude oil prices, because lower reﬁnery utilization rate will lead to
a preference for higher quality crude oil, putting upward pressure
on prices.  Note, U. S.  reﬁning capacity represents about one-ﬁfth
of world capacity.  6) Baltic exchange dirty tanker index.  We follow
Breitenfellner Name (2009) and Fan and Xu (2011) by using the
Baltic exchange dirty tanker index to track the shipping rates for
transportation of unreﬁned oil on representative routes.  Lower index
values generally correspond with declining oil prices. 
2. 2.  Demand factors
Demand factors have been shown to have a signiﬁcant and positive inﬂuence on crude oil prices (see Hamilton, 2009.  Hicks and
Kilian, 2009.  Kilian, 2009).  We consider several demand factors. 
1) GDP.  Global economic growth is closely related with oil demand. 
We consider the GDPs of the U. S. , China and the Euro area (19
countries), which together account for more than 60% of the global
GDP.  2) Kilian index.  Kilian (2009) develops an index that measures
shifts in the demand for industrial commodities that are driven by
the global business cycle.  Speciﬁcally, the index is based on dry
cargo single voyage ocean freight rates.  3) Steel production.  World
steel production has also been shown to be a reliable indicator of
global economic activity (Ravazzolo and Vespignani, 2015).  We use
the world steel production, as well as regional steel production in
the U. S. , China and the Euro area, as an important proxy for economic activity.  4) ISM manufacturing index.  The ISM manufacturing
index is widely viewed as an indicator of the business cycle (Scotti,
2013).  The index is based on surveys of more than 300 manufacturing ﬁrms conducted by the Institute of Supply Management.  5)
Global crude oil imports.  Global crude oil imports is another key factor
that reﬂects the state of the economy.  Ghosh (2009) ﬁnd a long-run
relationship between quantity of crude oil imports and the price of
the imported crude, and document unidirectional causality between
economic growth and crude oil imports. 
2. 3.  Financial market factors. 
The relationship between ﬁnancial market factors and oil prices
can be complex.  We consider the following three factors.  1) U. S. 
interest rates.  Frankel (2006) ﬁnd that crude oil prices are negatively
related with interest rates.  In particular, U. S.  monetary policy can
impact oil prices through its effect on both currency values and interest rates.  We consider the three-month Treasury bill rate and the
Federal fund rate in our study.  2) Exchange rates.  The importance
of the U. S.  dollar exchange rate in inﬂuencing oil prices has been
documented by Sadorsky (2000), andWang and Wu (2012), among
others.  Studies indicate that a weaker dollar usually leads to higher
oil prices as oil producers aim to regain the purchasing power of the
export revenues that are denominated in U. S.  dollars.  In addition, the
country whose currency appreciates against the U. S.  dollar is likely
to experience higher demand for crude oil due to reduced costs. 
We use the U. S.  dollar index, computed as the weighted geometric
mean of the dollar’s value relative to select currencies that include
the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish
Krona and Swiss Franc.  3) Stock market.  Jones and Kaul (1996) and
Sadorsky (1999) ﬁnd that the stock market and oil prices tend to
move together in the same direction, seemingly in response to global
aggregate demand factors.  Shifts in aggregate demand inﬂuence both
corporate proﬁts and the demand for oil.  Following Hammoudeh and
Li (2005) we use the S&P 500 and MSCI World indexes, respectively
as proxies for the U. S.  and world equity markets. 
2. 4.  Commodity market factors. 
It’s been noted that there is a relationship between crude prices
and the prices of other industrial commodities.  Following Coleman
(2012) and Baumeister and Kilian (2015), we select two indices in
our forecasting models.  1) S&P GSCI Non-Energy Index serve as a
benchmark for investments in commodity markets.  It consists of all
commodities included in the S&P GSCI index, with the exception
of crude oil and natural gas.  2) CRB Raw Industrial Materials index
(CRB Rind index) measures price movements in 22 basic commodities
whose markets are believed to be sensitive to changes in economic
conditions.  The selection of the two indices, which exclude crude
oil and natural gas, mitigates potential endogeneity problems in the
forecasting models. 
2. 5.  Speculative factors. 
The existence of an active derivatives market that allows for risk
sharing, price discovery and cost control is an important feature of
crude oil markets.  Over the past decade, and in particular after 2004,
there has been an ineluctable trend toward greater ﬁnancialization
of commodity markets with inﬂows of large amounts of investments
into commodity futures.  Derivatives markets which spawn speculative activities are believed to exert an important inﬂuence on oil
prices.  Behind such appeals is the implicit belief that crude oil prices
are impacted in a signiﬁcant manner by factors other than the prevailing market demand and supply conditions (see Kaufmann, 2011. 
Kilian and Murphy, 2014).  Following Coleman (2012), therefore, we
use the ratio of trading volume of oil futures contracts to global oil
production as a measure of speculative activities. 
2. 6.  GeoPolitical factor. 
Crude oil is commonly recognized as a commodity that is sensitive to geopolitical events.  Although many different variables exist
that may capture the geopolitical environment, we follow Coleman
(2012) by using the total amount of terrorist attack in the Middle East
and North Africa, which largely overlaps with OPEC countries, as a
proxy for geopolitical (in)stability. 11 This data is obtained from the
Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland, with details
of individual international terrorist incidents since 1970. 
3.  Forecasting models. 
3. 1.  Benchmark 1.  no-change forecast. 
Following the literature (see Alquist and Kilian, 2010.  Kilian and
Lee, 2014.  Baumeister and Kilian, 2015), we focus on the real price of
oil rather than log prices.  This helps avoid log approximation errors
when ﬁtting the real price of oil.  A commonly used benchmark for
judging the performance of forecasting models is provided by the
random walk model without drift.  This model implies that changes
in the spot price are unpredictable.  so the best available forecast of
future spot prices of crude oil is simply the current spot price. 
We consider
described below. 
three alternative forecasting benchmarks. 
3. 2.  Benchmark 2.  EIA forecast. 
The U. S.  Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) provides comprehensive oil price forecasts
regularly that are closely followed by market participants.  EIA constructs monthly and quarterly price forecasts, the Short-Term Energy
Outlook (STEO), with horizons ranging from one month to two
years. 12 The STEO are released on the ﬁrst Tuesday following the ﬁrst
Thursday of each month.  EIA analysts construct forecasts based on
information such as current and near-term futures prices of crude
oil, OPEC and non-OPEC production, global economic growth, crude
oil stock, among other factors.  It is worth noting that EIA uses largescale multi-equation econometric models to estimate supply and
demand conditions for crude oil in various energy markets, as well
as employs a consensus mechanism to arrive at the ﬁnal forecast. 13
3. 3.  Benchmark 3.  futures-based forecast
Market participants use oil futures prices to divine future spot
prices.  The futures-based forecast is generated as follows,
where Ft is the price of crude oil WTI futures contract that matures
in h periods and available at time t. 
3. 4.  Benchmark 4.  factor-based model
Factor-based models provide an alternative approach to forecast
oil prices (see Baumeister and Kilian, 2015).  A full factor-based model
includes all valid predictor variables relevant to the determination
of crude prices.  By definition, the full factor model is not parsimonious
and is subject to significant collinearity problems due to the
presence of strong correlations across variables.  We consider this
“kitchen sink” model as a benchmark for comparison purposes, and
later refine this to include significant variables found from LASSO and
stepwise regression methodologies. 
where the crude oil prices at time t (Pt) is a function of its lagged
terms and s independent variables, namely Xt,j, j = 1, .  .  .  , s.  et refers
to error term at time t, representing any potential temporary deviations
from long-term relationship that couldn’t be explained by the
model.  Note that this factor-based regression is in the form of a
reduced-form one-dimensional vector autoregression (VAR) model
with exogenous variables.  The regular VAR model would be more
appropriate when there are bidirectional interactions between the
dependent and independent variables.  In our study, given the relatively
large number of factors that are employed, plus the unidirectional
nature of influence for the majority of independent variables,
we use the reduced-form VAR model. 
3. 5.  The LASSO method. 
The LASSO method is an innovative variable selection method in
which the choice of predictive variables is carried out using an algorithmic
procedure.  It was first introduced by Tibshirani (1996) and
has gradually found application in the energy area such as electricity
consumption (Wang Name, 2007), electricity prices (Suard Name,
2010), and natural gas prices (Alfano Name, 2015). 
The LASSO method adds a penalty term to the cost function which
keeps the estimated value of the regression coefficients small, thus
reducing the inflation in standard errors often found in the presence
of multicollinearity.  When selecting variables, LASSO minimizes the
residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of
the coefficients being less than a constant.  More specifically. 
This problem is equivalent to,
and each k corresponds to a unique LASSO parameter c. 
When the LASSO parameter is small enough, some of the regression
coefficients shrink to zero.  Hence, the LASSO method selects
only a subset of the regression coefficients for each LASSO parameter. 
The LASSO parameter c > 0 controls the degree of shrinkage that
is applied for the estimates.  Tibshirani (1996) uses quadratic programming
techniques to solve each LASSO parameter of interest. 
Osborne Name (2000) develop a “homotopy” method to estimate the
parameters for all values of c.  In this paper we employ a computationally
efficient method developed by Efron Name (2004), a variant
of the “least angle regression” method to obtain a pre-determined
sequence of LASSO solutions.  All other LASSO solutions are obtained
by linear interpolation from the sequence of LASSO solutions.
