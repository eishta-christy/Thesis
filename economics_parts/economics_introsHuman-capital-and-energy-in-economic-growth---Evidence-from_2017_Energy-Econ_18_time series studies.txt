Environmental sustainability, climate change and global warming
have attracted increasing public awareness (Bloch Name, 2012.  Ma,
2015).  Many countries have set and ratiﬁed nationally determined
contributions in the recent Paris agreement, targeting to keep the global
average temperature increase well below 2 °C above pre-industrial
levels.  China, who accounts for half of the world coal consumption
and contributes to 25% of the world carbon dioxide emission (Energy
Information Administration, 2016), in particular, sets a goal of achieving
the peak before 2030, lowering the emission per unit of GDP by 60–65%
from its 2005 level, and increasing the non-fossil fuel share in the primary energy consumption to 20%.  A sweeping energy evolution is called
for in China since 2014 with new priority placed on environmental goals
and the deployment of clean energy. 1 However, it remains a challenge
to meet the goal considering the uneven distribution of energy
resources and unbalanced economic growth with a high degree of
inequality (Herrerias Name, 2013.  Song and Zheng, 2012).  For China
to align the long-term low carbon energy strategy with economic development goals, the central government has set and broken down the carbon and energy intensity reduction target at the level of individual
provinces.  Motivated by the context characterized by heterogeneous
energy strategy and economic development paths in each of these provinces, this paper addresses three main questions.  1) does energy play a
role in promoting provincial growth together with the physical and
human capital.  2) how and to what extent the disaggregate energy
source is responsible for economic growth.  and 3) what is the causal
direction between total and disaggregate energy use and growth of
economy in each of these provinces, if any.  The answers will provide
rich policy implications for a better understanding of interaction between localized development path and energy conservation to set an
implementable emission reduction target for sustainable development. 
In the literature, many scholars examine the cointegration and Granger causal link between energy use and economic development in China
using national time series data (Shiu and Lam, 2004.  Zhang and Cheng,
2009.  Bloch Name, 2012).  While country level studies provide some insights on the relationship between energy consumption and economic
growth, they have at least two major limitations.  In terms of method,
the power of unit root and cointegration tests in time series studies is low
due to a short time span (Campbell and Perron, 1991).  the conventional
causality tests using time series have a high risk of wrongly rejecting the
null hypothesis of no cointegration (Yalta and Cakar, 2012) and therefore
can lead to inaccurate conclusions on the direction of causality.
