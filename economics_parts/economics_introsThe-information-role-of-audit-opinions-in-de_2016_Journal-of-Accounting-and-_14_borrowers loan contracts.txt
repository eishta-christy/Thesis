The auditor's report is the primary channel through which auditors communicate with financial statement users
information discovered during the auditing process.  Financial analysts and regulators have criticized the existing auditor's
reporting model as having little communicative value, and additional disclosures have been proposed to enhance the value
of the audit report (Church Name, 2008; PCAOB, 2013). 1 Under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement
and Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), the auditor's reporting options are to issue either an unqualified opinion
or an unqualified opinion with explanatory language, commonly called a modified audit opinion (MAO). 2 This inclusion of
discretionary explanatory language, such as citing a lack of accounting consistency, emphasizing a material uncertainty, or
expressing a going concern (GC) opinion, is the only difference between a standard clean opinion and an MAO. 3 In fact, an
MAO is the sole way for auditors to communicate audit-specific information to outsiders. 4 There is still debate, however,
about the extent to which the auditor's report communicates relevant information to financial statement users (Church
Name, 2008; DeFond and Zhang, 2014).  In this study, we empirically investigate the relevance of MAOs in private debt
contracting. 
A large portion of the prior research that studied modified opinions focuses on the market reaction to the auditor's report
and provides evidence that equity investors react negatively to the issuance of a nonstandard opinion, especially to a GC
opinion (e. g.  Loudder Name, 1992; Fleak and Wilson, 1994; Menon and Williams, 2010).  We investigate the relevance of
auditor reporting from the perspective of debtholders for several reasons.  First, accounting information is often a direct
input in debt contracting; for example, debt covenants may rely on accounting numbers to monitor firm performance.  If an
MAO indicates low financial reporting quality, lenders will change the relative use of accounting-based covenants and
general covenants in loans issued after MAOs.  Second, debt contracts provide multi-dimensional information about
borrowers; loan contracts allow us to investigate the effects of audit opinions on both price and non-price costs of debt,
including loan covenants, loan size, loan maturity, and collateral requirements.  Finally, debtholders, whose payoffs are
concave in relation to firm value, demand a timely shift of control rights in order to discipline managers in the case of poor
firm performance (Dewatripont and Tirole, 1994; Ball Name, 2008).
