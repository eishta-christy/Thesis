1. 1.  The problem. 
A popular product sold by energy companies to medium-to-large
customers is one where an unspeciﬁed amount of power can be
bought at a ﬁxed price during a certain time-interval.  We call this a
ﬁxed price, unspeciﬁed consumption contract or simply a ﬁxed price
agreement.  The business-to-business electricity market in Denmark
in 2014 was 23. 1 TWh, about MEUR 800 million in monetary terms. 
60% was sold as ﬁxed price agreements in some form. 
Having entered into the ﬁxed price agreement, the energy
company must asses and manage the risks associated with the
obligations of the contract.  This is challenging for several reasons.  If
the seller faced only the risk from price-ﬂuctuations, he could simply buy forward contracts to set up a full, perfect hedge.  However,
with a criterion function that takes into account both (expected)
gains and losses, this is expensive if forward-prices are typically
above expected future spot-prices.  This so-called contango is the
norm in Nordic power markets, as demonstrated by both Botterud
Name (2002) and our analysis in Section 5. 1. 
Another complicating factor is quantity risk.  If the consumer’s
quantity choice were all-or-nothing, the contract would have payoff akin to call options.  Handling that would require modelling the
price randomness of the electricity market which has several characteristics that are different from standard ﬁnancial markets such
as stocks and exchange rates.  But the consumer has more ﬂexibility
and because energy demand is created by physical use, her choice
will not be all-or-nothing.  Demand will be positively correlated with
the price as high demand drives up the price.  For the contract seller
that creates what in other areas of ﬁnance would be known as
wrong-way risk.  He will have to deliver a lot of energy for a ﬁxed
price when buying it in the spot market is expensive. 
In this paper, we will deal with these risks with a joint model of
spot-price and consumption load. 
1. 2.  Previous work, related literature. 
The non-storability of electricity is a key complicating factor in
energy markets.  It makes physical hedging inoperable and it causes
highly volatile spot-markets with structural price jumps, see for
instance Benth Name (2008).  As a consequence, the problem of
joint quantity and price risk on electricity markets is commonly
studied in the literature and it stresses the importance of incorporating price–quantity correlation into the models.  For an example,
Bessembinder and Lemmon (2002) consider an equilibrium market
model for which the correlation has a signiﬁcant impact on optimal hedging strategies in forward markets.  Their model has been
extended by, for instance, Willems and Morbee (2010) who study the
effect of including options onto the market.  From the retailer’s perspective with an exogenously given spot and forward market, Oum
Name (2006) use utility maximisation to derive optimal hedge strategies that exploit the correlation to manage price–quantity risk in a
single period setting.  As another example, Boroumand Name (2015)
address the problem of price–quantity risk on an intra-day scale and
demonstrate with a simulation approach that intra-day hedging outperforms daily and longer term portfolios.  We also take the retailer’s
perspective and model the spot-price/consumption-load correlation
with a bivariate model where both the spot and load have temporal dependency.  Based on that model, we set out to hedge the
price–quantity risk of a ﬁxed price agreement with forward contracts.  In relation to our approach, Coulon Name (2013) develop an
intricate three-factor model and consider hedging strategies based
on options that are priced with closed form expressions.  In contrast,
we do not consider the problem of pricing derivatives under our
model, but concentrate on a operational hedging approach based on
exogenously given market forward-price data. 
1. 3.  Structure, contributions, and ﬁndings. 
The rest of the paper is organised as follows.  In Section 2, we formulate a dynamic model for electricity spot-price and consumptionload — a two-dimensional Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model with
a seasonality component.  In Section 3, we analyse expected loss
minimisation.  Looking speciﬁcally at static hedging strategies with
forward contracts, a main contribution of the paper is the derivation
of explicit formulas for optimal hedge portfolios based on three different loss functions.  the square, the exponential, and the “hockey
stick”.  the two latter based on asymmetric risk measures appear
new.  Section 4 is an empirical study of the hedging performance
based on publicly available consumption, spot- and forward-prices
from the Nordic region.  The empirical results demonstrate substantial beneﬁts for the derived asymmetric hedges over the common
industry benchmark that uses a position in forward contracts equal
to the expected load.  It should be noted that unlike many sources
in the literature, the hedge experiments in this paper truly test outof-sample performance.  The hedge portfolio constructed at, say, time
t uses only information about state-variables and model parameters
that was truly available at time t.  Section 5 investigates the robustness of the results.  First, we test if forward-prices add information
that can be easily exploited in the hedge constructions.  We ﬁnd this
not to be the case.  Second, we consider a model extension with jumps
(or spikes) in which we derive optimal hedges and implement these. 
We ﬁnd little to no empirical improvement over the original hedge
performance.  Section 6 concludes and describes directions for future
research. 
<Middle> The electricity price and consumption model. 
Our approach will be to model jointly the electricity spot price
and the consumption load with a continuous stochastic process.  Both
the price and the load exhibit seasonal patterns – the time of the day,
day of the week and climatological season naturally effect the spot
price and consumption, see Benth Name (2008) and Haugom (2011) –
and we will ﬁt deterministic periodic functions to capture this
seasonality.  The residual price and load will then be modelled with
a stationary process and we conveniently choose the continuous
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for this purpose. 1
2. 1.  The bivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. 
The bivariate mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
(Xt, Yt)t≥0 is given by the solution to the stochastic differential
equation,
where jx, jy, s x, s y are positive parameters, hx, hy ∈ R and the
Brownian motions W(1), W(2) are correlated with qw ∈ [−1, 1].  The
standard trick of multiplying by integrating factors, i. e.  using the
Ito formula on e−jxtX(t) and e−jytY(t), gives us the more explicit
expressions, from which we see that the univariate covariance functions are here,
and that the cross-covariance function is this,
where we have deﬁned the parameters. 
From Eq.  (1) it also follow that (X, Y) is a Gaussian process, in
particular the conditional distribution is bivariate normal (BVN) and
given by this,
with mean vector and covariance matrix. 
2. 2.  Parameter estimation. 
2. 3.  The seasonal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. 
With observed data we refer to a set of observations made at n+1
time-points t0, .  .  .  , tn with Di = ti − ti−1 denoting the spacings of the
time grid.  An observed path x = (x0, .  .  .  , xn) of the process (Xt)t≥0
is a set of observations where xi is the observed value of Xti for i =
0, .  .  .  , n.  From Eq.  (2) we write the log-likelihood for the observed
path x of the univariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as a function of
the parameters x = (j, h, s)
where 0 is the normal density function, here with (conditional) mean
li+1|i = xie−jDi+1 + h(1 − e−jDi+1 ) and variance s 2
t+1|i = s 2(1 −
e−2jDi+1 )/(2j).  The decomposition of the density comes from the fact
that X is a Markov process.  since the Markov property gives that
f(xi+1|xi, .  .  .  , x0) =f (xi+1|xi) for the conditional density, we can write
f (x0, .  .  .  , xn) = f (xn|xn−1) .  .  .  f (x1|x0)f (x0). 
The maximum likelihood estimate 
x is the argument that maximizes the log-likelihood
which may be obtained by a numerical optimiser. 2 Calculating the
observed information matrix by numerical differentiation at estimated values gives an estimatedstandard error of the j(cid. 5)th parameter as
xx and ˆ
denotes element i, j of the inverse matrix of A.  Further, if ˆare univariate estimates from two observed paths x and y,
gives an estimator of qw where ˆq(x, y) is the sample correlation
coeﬃcient between x and y. 
A bivariate observation (x, y)
from the bivariate OrnsteinUhlenbeck process with parameters xxy = (jx, hx, s x, jy, hy, s y, qw)
yields the log-likelihood from Eq 
where li+1|i ≡ lti+Di|ti
and Si+1|i ≡ Sti+Di|ti are the conditional
mean vector and covariance matrix given in the previous section. 
Here 02 denotes the bivariate normal density and the maximum
likelihood estimate ˆxxy may be obtained by numerical optimisation along with estimated standard errors from the numerically
calculated information matrix. 
Since the price and consumption of electricity exhibit seasonal behaviours, we will work with a model for the spot-price S
and consumption-load L as given by so-called seasonal OrnsteinUhlenbeck model,
where (˜S, ˜L) follows a bivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process while
HS(t) andH L(t) are deterministic seasonality functions of time.  For
this purpose, we let H(t) be a periodic function deﬁned by
and the regression matrix
A(0) of dimension [n × p + 1] is a function of the phase vector. 
If, for a moment, we consider the phases to be ﬁxed, then the estimation of the amplitudes is a standard least-squares optimisation
problem. 
ie.  a function of the phase vector a∗ = a∗(0).  This lead us to perform
the estimation in two steps. 
by numerical optimisation.  Then we perform the regression
to obtain parameter estimates (ˆa, ˆ
0) of the periodic function.  Our
estimation approach ﬁts the seasonal functions to price and load
in the ﬁrst step and an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to the deseasonalised price and load in the second step. 
2 For equidistant observations estimators can be found in closed, but slightly
lengthy, form. 
Remark 1.  As an alternative to a two-step estimation of the seasonal
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, note that we may write the likelihood
of the full model.  Following the notational convention that we introduce in Section 3. 2 and denoting the respective amplitude- and
phase vectors with aS, 0S, aL, 0L, the 4p + 9 parameter vector
goes into the Gaussian likelihood of the same form as Eq.  (3) with
conditional mean being a function of amplitudes and phases as well,
see Eqs.  (8)–(9).  Numerical optimisation of the likelihood is, however, unstable due to the large number of parameters.  For example,
in the empirical study of Section 4 we use ﬁve periods for the seasonal components which yields 29 parameters in total.  We found the
numerical optimisation of the likelihood on market data with respect
to the full vector Eq.  (5) to be unstable.  For this reason, we employ
the robust two-step approach instead. 
3.  Risk-minimising static hedging
The hedging problem we are facing is to replicate a future uncertain ﬁnancial obligation.  That is, one tries to replicate the future
payment with other ﬁnancial products, typically liquid contracts that
are traded in the market, and in our case we will use forward contracts.  We design a static hedging strategy.  a buy-and-hold position
in the forward contract that aims at hedging our ﬁnancial obligation. 
Our approach to determine the forward position will be the method
of expected loss minimisation. 
To this end, let pT denote the payoff at time T of the hedged position, that is, the ﬁnancial obligation we want to hedge together with
a portfolio of hedging instruments.  Then −pT gives the loss of the
position and
E[u(−pT)]gives a measure of risk for some speciﬁed loss function u (see Artzner
Name (1999) for details of risk measures).  The problem at hand is to
choose the hedging portfolio such that this risk is minimised.  Hence,
the task is to choose both type of hedging instruments and positions
to buy/sell of these instruments at initiation.  Notice that if we were
to set up a dynamic hedging strategy instead, then we would have to
choose the time-points or events at which to rebalance the hedging
portfolio. 3
3. 1.  Hedging a ﬁxed price agreement. 
Assume that we want to hedge a ﬁxed price agreement that
expires at a speciﬁed future time T > t0 where t0 is the initiation
time.  This is a ﬁnancial contract with payoff (ST − Ffpa)LT at time T for
the long position and its features can be explained by the following
situation.  At time t0, we enter a contract with a counterparty where
we obligate ourselves to deliver an unspeciﬁed quantity LT of electricity at time T for the agreed price Ffpa.  The quantity will be the
unknown consumption of the counterparty.  At the expiry time T, we
will have to cover our contracted delivery of electricity by purchasing
the same quantity from the spot market at a price ST.  Our cash-ﬂow
for the position at time T then amounts to
FfpaLT − STLT
which is the short position of the ﬁxed price agreement. 
7. 2 and references therein. 
To set up a static, buy-and-hold, hedge at time t0 for the naked
position (notice that ST and LT are unknown at t0), we enter a forward
contract with expiry time T and forward price F.  This is a contract
with payoff ST − F at time T and we enter the forward with a position
V to be determined at initiation.  If we assume that the ﬁxed price
agreement has a price relative to the forward Ffpa = F + m, where
m is some non-negative margin, then the total payoff of our hedged
position is this. 
The hedging problem is to specify, at initiation time t0, the forward position V in an optimal way.  For this purpose, we employ the
approach of minimising the risk measure Eq.  (6) speciﬁed with three
different loss functions.  (i) the positive loss u(x) =max(x, 0), (ii) the
quadratic loss u(x) =x 2 and (iii) the exponential loss u(x) =exp(x). 
Our aim is thus to minimise the risk of the hedged portfolio with
respect to the forward position, that is. 
Common to all three loss functions is that they are convex which
makes the corresponding risk measures convex as well, see Föllmer
and Schied (2011).  A second property which holds for the positive
loss and exponential loss is monotonicity.  if the outcome of position A is certainly smaller than that of position B, then position A
will have greater risk.  This means that these measures take downside risk into account while, in contrast, the quadratic-loss measure
is symmetric.  both positive and negative variations of the loss are
equal contributors to the risk.  The expected positive loss also satisﬁes the sub-additivity property part of the coherent risk measure
deﬁnition.  A monetary interpretation of this property means that one
will beneﬁt from diversiﬁcation.  the risk of a portfolio of assets is less
or equal to the risk of the individual assets. 
Financial contracts traded at the exchange for power derivatives
are typically not speciﬁed with a single expiry-time as in the previous example.  A power forward obligate the counterparties to settle
the difference between spot and ﬁxed price at a set of time-points
during a speciﬁed period, for example a month, quarter or a year. 
There is typically a base-load and a peak-load version of the contract
as well, where the latter has settlements on peak-hours only, that is
weekdays 08. 00 to 20. 00 for the Nordic market, while the former has
settlements on every full hour during the expiry period. 
We consider ﬁxed price agreements and forwards that are speciﬁed with an expiry month M and we let M(p) denote peak-hours
during this month and M(op) the remaining off-peak hours.  The
payoff at time Ti for the hedged position during off-peak is thus
for all Ti ∈ M(op), where V b is the position in thebase-load forward with price Fb.  Notice that we assume the pricing
Fb-fpa = Fb +m with margin m ≥ 0 for delivery during off-peak of the
ﬁxed price agreement, in particular, we let m = 0.  For a time-point
(cid. 20)
during peak periods we have the choice to include in our hedge portfolio a position Vp in the peak-load forward with price Fp ≥ Fb where we assume a pricing Fp-fpa ≥ ˜F + m with margin m ≥ 0 and we
set m = 0 here as well.  To determine the optimal hedge for the entire
month M with the expected loss measure, we minimise the function
for the off-peak and peak contract respectively.  Starting with the
positive loss function u(x) = max(x, 0), the expected loss may be
written as such that the minimising argument
load forward positions of our hedge. 
Remark 2.  Note that, as the loss functions are convex, and convex
(cid. 24)
functions are invariant under aﬃne transformations, we have that
V (cid. 9)→ u(−(S − F)(V − L)) is a convex map, as well as the total risk V (cid. 9)→
iu(−(Si−F)(V−Li)).  Thus, we have that any local minimum is indeed
a global minimum and the same holds for minimising f(Vb, V p) jointly
with respect to (Vb, Vp) due to linearity. 
3. 2.  Hedging with the seasonal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. 
To be able to minimise the total expected loss of a monthly contract and ﬁnd the optimal hedge we will derive an expression for
the expectation in Eq.  (7) with the margin set to zero.  To simplify
the notation, assume a current time t0 = 0 with given spot-price
S0 = s and load L0 = l such that ˜S0 = ˜s = s − HS(0) and ˜L0 =
˜l = l − HL(0) are the current values of the de-seasonalised spot and
load.  Let (jS, jL, hS, hL, s S, s L, qW) be the parameters of the OrnsteinUhlenbeck process (˜S, ˜L).  The distribution of (S, L) at a future time T, 
are independent standard normal variables and we have
such that we can write the expected positive loss. 
For a general Gaussian variable, X ∼ N (l, s 2) , straightforward
calculations give this,
where V and 0 are the standard normal distribution and density
respectively.  These expressions may readily be used for h1 and h2. 
Note that the ﬁrst moments depend on both the time t and timelag D while the second moments depend on the time-lag only.  In
effect we may write the payoff at time T of the hedged position as the
product of two linear functions of Z and Z,
that is, the payoff is a product of two correlated normal variables
dependent on F, V, where F, V will play the role of Fb, Vb and ˜F, Vb +Vp
which gives us a ﬁnal expression for the expected positive loss,
this simpliﬁes the expected positive loss to a closed-form expression. 
The expected loss calculated with dependency between the deseasonalised spot and load4 is shown in Fig.  1 along with the
expected loss calculated from the independent speciﬁcation of the
model.  The difference between the two expected loss functions is
small.  In particular, the minimum expected loss from the two models
is obtained at the same argument, that is, the zero-correlation case
yields the same optimal hedge position as the dependent case. 
For the exponential loss function u(x) = exp(x) we again have by this. 
we obtain a ﬁnal expression for the expected exponential loss. 
Where the moment generating function of g(Z, Z
mally distributed as in Eq.  (10) is used for the second equality. 
Expanding the square, we may write the exponent as a quadratic
function of Z,
and hence, with the coeﬃcients a, b, c, deﬁned as above. 
For the quadratic loss function u(x) = x2 we have the expected
squared loss measure where the conditional expectation is this. 
Substituting this back into Eq.  (11) gives, after a few simpliﬁcations,
the quadratic loss measure, where we have employed the fact that E[Z] =E [Z3] = 0
while E[Z2] = 1 and E[Z4] = 3 for a standard normal variable. 
Differentiation with respect to V and equating to zero yields this where
is chi-squared distributed with one degree of freedom and non-centrality parameter b2/(4c2).  Using the moment
generating function of the non-central chi-squared distribution
generated outcomes from the standard normal distribution
which is the forward position of the optimal hedge obtained from
minimising the expected quadratic loss.  Notice here that quadratic
hedging suggests a forward position equal to the expectation of the
load in the case when the de-seasonalised spot and load are assumed
Upon inspection of Fig.  2, we see that both the spot-price and load
series exhibit seasonal patterns, particularly evidently for the load. 
Power consumption inherently varies with the time of the day and
day of the week.  Due to electrical heating during winter (and air cooling during summer) there is a variety with the climatological season
as well.  The seasonality of consumption is transferred to the spot
price as demand for electricity affects its price.  Further, as the climatological season affects the production of hydroelectricity, there will
also be seasonal dependent factors that affects supply, and thus the
price.  Finally, notice that the spot price may turn negative with some
remarkably large negative values recorded around the new years of
2012, 2013 and 2014. 6
uncorrelated.  The hedging strategy is hence completely independent of our expectation of the future spot price.  I particular, the loss
(ST−F)(LT−V) will potentially be substantial for the hedger when the
load is at high levels (above expectation) since then the spot-price is
typically high as well, due to the actual positive correlation between
the two (the wrong-way risk).  On the other hand if one assumes
a non-zero positive correlation, the hedge position Eq.  (12) will be
increased if the spot is expected to be high, lS > F, which in turn
decreases the potential large losses in high-spot-high-load scenarios. 
4.  Empirical study. 
In this section, we present an empirical study of the performance
of our hedging approach.  We base the study partly on publicly available market data, partly on a set of proprietary load data obtained
from DONG Energy who is a major player in the Danish power
market.  The data is presented in the next section along with ﬁtted
seasonal functions and estimated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck parameters
from the residual processes.  Next, we report the results from our
hedging approach based on expected loss minimisation and compare
these with a benchmark average-load strategy which is widely used
by the industry.  Finally, we present a simple extension of our model
to account for spikes in the spot price and investigate how this affects
the hedging results. 
4. 1.  Data and ﬁtted model. 
We test the empirical performance of
the model-based
loss-minimising hedges using spot-prices,
forward-prices and
consumption-load data from the price area DK1 of the Danish power
market. 5 The price and load data are recorded with an hourly observation frequency during the period 1 January 2012 to 31 December
2014 and it is shown in Fig.  2.  The spot price (top panel) is measured
in EUR/MWh (euros per megawatt hour) while the load data (bottom
panel) is measured in MWh.  In addition to the publicly available consumption data in Fig.  2, we have access to a set of proprietary load
data that has been made available to us from DONG Energy.  This data
has been anonymized by scaling with the maximum load and it is
shown in Fig.  2 in the Appendix.  We return to the data from DONG
Energy in Section 4. 3. 
We use market quotes of peak and base forwards with monthly
expiries for the DK1 price area in addition to the spot-price and
load data.  We initiate our hedge approximately two weeks prior to
the expiry month of the forward contract and we have listed the
corresponding forward prices in Table 1. 
Remark 3.  The data from the Nordic power market contains quotes
of base and peak forwards noted on the Nord-Pool system spot-price
and certiﬁcate of difference forwards (CDF) for the different Nordic
price areas, see Table 5 in the Appendix.  As the CDF forward for the
DK1–system difference is quoted for a base version only, we are, in
fact, subject to a basis risk that we do not hedge against.  However,
since the basis affects peak-hours only with the DK1-system spotprice difference (typically an order of magnitude smaller than the
actual price) and with the peak-position (typically half the size of the
base-position), we chose to ignore the basis and perform our hedging
experiment as if the peak-forward was noted on the DK1 spot price
as well.  We ignore the same basis for the average-load hedge to be
able to fairly compare the two strategies. 
To achieve a better ﬁt for the seasonality functions, we separate
weekends (including holidays) from weekdays (Monday to Friday)
and ﬁt two periodic functions separately to each of the two data
sets. 7 The combined seasonality functions ﬁtted to the load and spot
price from the period 2012-01-01 to 2012-12-31 (Fig.  3) clearly capture a seasonal behaviour where the ﬁtted function for the load is
particularly reminiscent of the original data.  We used ﬁve periods of
12, 24, 168 (one week), 4380 (half year) and 8760 (one year) hours for
this purpose.  Notice that the axes’ scales of Fig.  3 are kept unchanged
from Fig.  2 to highlight how the amplitude of ﬁtted periodic functions
compare to the amplitude of unﬁtted data.  The residual processes
(the de-seasonalised data shown in the middle panels of Fig.  5) are
then ﬁtted to a bivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with resulting
estimated parameters and standard errors recorded in Table 2. 
We do a rough investigation of the goodness-of-ﬁt of our model
before we continue with the hedging problem.  The histogram of deseasonalised spot-price data in Fig.  4 shows a decent ﬁt to the normal
distribution (the marginal distribution of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process) while the load data shows a strong ﬁt.  Next, if we compare simulated paths from the bivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
(left panels of Fig.  5) with the de-seasonalised data (middle panels of
Fig.  5), we ﬁnd that the simulated processes are fairly reminiscent of
the data we intend to model.  Obviously, our model can not generate
any jump discontinuities – the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the
periodic function are continuous functions – or jump-like extremes
and thus the model fails to capture the jumps of the market data.  This
is particularly evident when we look at the simulated spot-spice (ie. 
the simulated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process added to the ﬁtted seasonality function, top right Fig.  5) compared to the original data (top
Fig.  2), while it is not as evident for the load.  However, as our ultimate objective is to ﬁnd an eﬃcient hedging strategy and not to ﬁnd
the best ﬁtting time-series model, we are continue with our model
while aware of some of its shortcomings. 8
If we look at the sample autocorrelation functions of the deseasonalised data and compare to the correlation function e−jD of the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we ﬁnd a mediocre match (left panel
of Fig.  6).
