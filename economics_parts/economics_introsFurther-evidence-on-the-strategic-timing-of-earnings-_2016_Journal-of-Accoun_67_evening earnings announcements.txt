How ﬁrms disseminate information to ﬁnancial markets, how the market responds to this information, and how the
mechanism of information dissemination affects the market response are of great importance (e. g. , Grossman and Stiglitz,
1980; Merton, 1987).  Perhaps the most common and most important vehicle by which ﬁrms release information to the
market is through their earnings announcements.  In particular, one of the decision variables is the exact timing of the
earnings release.  If the timing of the release affects the market's response to ﬁrms’ earnings, then ﬁrms may release news
strategically, for instance, to hide bad news.  Prior studies examining the choice of weekday and, separately, time during the
day for earnings announcements show that there is a higher concentration of bad news on Friday than on other weekdays
(Penman, 1987; Damodaran, 1989; DellaVigna and Pollet, 2009; Doyle and Magilke, 2009; deHaan, Shevlin, and Thornock,
2015) and in the evening (after trading hours) than at other times of day (Patell and Wolfson, 1982; Doyle and Magilke,
2009; deHaan Name, 2015).  Recent studies have recognized that the mere concentration of bad news on Friday and in the
evening is not sufﬁcient to establish the existence of strategic announcement timing.  Doyle and Magilke consider opportunistic announcement switching and ﬁnd no evidence that managers switch announcements of bad earnings news to
Friday or evening.  deHaan, Shevlin, and Thornock analyze variation in investor attention and ﬁnd evidence consistent with
rational strategic announcing in the evening but not on Friday. 
Our study extends the existing literature and contributes to the debate of whether and when ﬁrms strategically
announce their earnings news in two ways.  First, because ﬁrms choose the weekday and time of their announcements
jointly, we introduce the analysis of day-time combinations to the literature on opportunistic announcement timing.  Second, we provide new implications of strategic announcing, with a special focus on whether managers have potential
beneﬁts from their announcement timing. 
The analysis of announcement timing at the level of day-time combinations provides us with new insights about
managers’ strategic timing behavior.  The higher concentration of bad news on Friday and, separately, in the evening found in
the prior studies leads to a natural conjecture: Announcements on Friday evenings, which are the intersection of Fridays and
evenings, have the worst news and, thus, are the most susceptible to opportunistic announcing behavior.  This conjecture is
also consistent with both the popular wisdom that ﬁrms and even government agencies tend to release bad news on Friday
afternoon after 4 PM (Penman, 1987) and common knowledge in the ﬁnancial industry that analysts and other professional
investors are less likely to be at work on Friday evenings (e. g. , Quenqua, 2010).  We ﬁnd that Friday evening announcements
indeed contain by far the worst news of all day-time combinations. 
In support of the strategic announcing hypothesis, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms switch to Friday evening when they have bad news.  A
host of additional ﬁndings concerning the post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD), insider trading, delistings, and conference
calls point out that strategic announcing occurs only on Friday evening.  We also ﬁnd that managers beneﬁt from their strategic
choice through reduced market scrutiny and delayed market response to news announced on Friday evening.  The PEAD after
Friday evening announcements allows managers to proﬁt through post-announcement buying and selling of the company's stock
in the direction of the surprise.  The delayed market response to bad news can also provide managers with greater job security
and beneﬁts associated with continued employment in the ﬁrm (Kothari Name, 2009). 
To analyze day-time combinations, we divide earnings announcements into three time-of-day slots—morning (between
midnight and 9:30 AM), during-trading (between 9:30 AM and 4 PM), and evening (between 4PM and midnight)—and ﬁve
weekdays, which creates a matrix of 15 timing cells.  We use a comprehensive dataset of earnings announcement timestamps for the period from 1999 to 2013, which we hand-collect from newswires to avoid the systematic errors in IBES
timestamps (Bradley Name, 2014; Michaely Name, 2014).  The timing cell resolution allows us to uncover new patterns in
opportunistic announcements, and it also puts in perspective the well-documented results regarding bad news on Friday
and in the evening.  We ﬁnd that Friday evening announcements are responsible for a disproportionately large portion of the
bad news on Fridays documented in the literature—Friday evening announcements constitute 17% of Friday announcements
but produce one third of the negative difference in earnings surprise between Fridays and other weekdays.  We also ﬁnd that
while evenings have only marginally worse news than other times of the day, without Friday evening announcements in the
sample, the evening effect completely disappears. 
By itself, the high concentration of bad news at one time is insufﬁcient to conclude that strategic announcement
timing is occurring.  We answer the question whether and when strategic announcement timing exists by focusing on
ﬁrms’ decisions to switch the times and weekdays of their announcements depending on their earnings surprise.  We
begin by analyzing to which timing cells ﬁrms switch when they have worse news relative to the previous quarter (Doyle
and Magilke, 2009).  We also conduct a difference-in-differences test to examine whether ﬁrms that switch to a given cell
have a greater decline in earnings surprise than ﬁrms that do not switch, i. e. , that have stayed in this cell since the
previous quarter.  We ﬁnd that among all weekdays, times of day, and timing cells, only Friday evening robustly indicates
strategic switching behavior. 
Next, we test an important implication of the opportunism motive that managers are rational when they time earnings
announcements, which means that they can ultimately beneﬁt from timing such announcements.  Successfully hiding news
implies that the market does not fully incorporate the news into prices and has a delayed reaction to the earnings
announced at a given timing cell.  Further, opportunistic announcements may allow insiders to beneﬁt from trading the
company's shares after the public information is released and before the information is fully impounded into prices.  While
the literature typically views opportunistic announcements as a strategy related to bad news, insiders can also beneﬁt from
buying shares before a delayed market reaction to good news.  To test the conjecture that ﬁrms making announcements
strategically can beneﬁt from delayed market reaction, we analyze the PEAD and document patterns in it after
announcements at different combinations of weekdays and times of day. 
We ﬁnd that both positive and negative news on Friday evening are followed by the largest drift in comparison to other
timing cells.  The PEAD after good news on Friday evening lasts for up to 13 months, and the PEAD after bad news is longer,
approximately 2 years.  A strategy with a long position in ﬁrms that announce positive news and a short position in ﬁrms
that announce negative news yields 24. 4% in 13 months for Friday evening versus the average of 4. 2% over all ﬁfteen timing
cells.  Our analysis of insider trading suggests that executives may be aware of the drift following Friday evening
announcements.  We ﬁnd that, after these announcements, insiders tend to trade in the direction of the surprise, in contrast
to the overall pattern of contrarian trading by insiders (Huddart Name, 2007; Jenter, 2005). 
The ﬁnding that Friday evening stands out among other timing cells led us to survey investment managers regarding
their thoughts about announcing earnings on Friday evening.  The main message in the survey results is that announcing
earnings on Friday evening is interpreted as an attempt to hide bad news.  Another important point that was made is that
many analysts have already left for the weekend when ﬁrms announce their earnings on Friday evening.  Building upon the
intuition of the survey results, we ﬁnd further evidence suggesting that ﬁrms intend to reduce the number of analysts who
review their announcements on Friday evening.  The time distribution of announcements on Friday evening is different from
other evenings in that Friday evening announcements are made relatively late, while other weekday evening announcements are strongly concentrated immediately after the market closes. 
Besides earnings ﬁgures, ﬁrms tend to concurrently release other performance measures and soft information about
their current and future endeavors.  This raises a possibility that ﬁrms’ management tends to announce on Friday evening
to hide not only earnings news but other information as well.  Following the intuition of this conjecture, ﬁrms should also
be less likely to hold conference calls and, furthermore, give less notiﬁcation time about upcoming conference calls.  Our
analysis of the distribution of conference calls associated with earnings announcements strongly supports this hypothesis
for Friday evening.  For example, Friday evening announcements are followed by half as many conference calls and
associated with 2–3 times fewer days between the announcements and actual dates of conference calls than other
timing cells. 
Finally, based on the ﬁndings that ﬁrms interact with analysts less at the time of Friday evening announcements and
receive less market scrutiny as a result, we can identify events other than earnings news that managers may want to
hide through opportunistic timing of earnings announcements.  Firms would be most inclined to proceed with opportunistic timing to hide information associated with the most critical events in a ﬁrm's life.  Two such events are when a
ﬁrm goes bankrupt or is acquired, both of which typically lead to stock delisting.  A ﬁrm in ﬁnancial distress would wish
not to elaborate on the extent of its difﬁculties to avoid further exacerbating the distress situation.  Similarly, a ﬁrm being
too forthcoming can disrupt the ﬁrm's negotiations with prospective acquirers, causing managers to lose their
unscheduled stock option grants (Fich Name, 2011) or leading to ﬁnancial liability, such as a termination fee (Bates and
Lemmon, 2003).  We ﬁnd that it is Friday evening announcements that are more likely to be followed by these two types
of delisting events.  In particular, a ﬁrm is ﬁve times more likely to be liquidated or its stock to be dropped from the
exchange in the 120 days following a Friday evening announcement compared with announcements in other timing
cells.  A ﬁrm is also more than twice as likely to be acquired and, as a result, delisted during this period after Friday
evening announcements. 
Our ﬁndings support that Friday evening earnings announcements are motivated by managerial opportunism.  This raises
a question how pervasive and important such opportunistic behavior is among publicly traded U.
