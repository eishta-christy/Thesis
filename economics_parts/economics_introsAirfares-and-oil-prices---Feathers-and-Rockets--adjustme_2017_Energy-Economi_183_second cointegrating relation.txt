The price of crude oil declines by about 57%, from $102. 51 to $43. 58
between June 2014 and May 2016.  During that period, the CPI for airfare
declines by about 12%.  This small decline is somewhat surprising.  jet fuel
accounts for about 33% of average operating costs incurred by the airline
industry (Berghofer and Lucey, 2014).  Consistent with this large percentage, industry analysts estimate that the reduction in oil prices will save US
airlines about $20 billion in 2015 (New York Times, January 20, 2015). 
The juxtaposition of a large cost saving and a relatively small
price reduction is a topic for both academic researchers and policy
enforcement.  From an academic perspective, airlines respond to
changes in oil prices three ways.  (1) changing the energy efﬁciency of
their operations (i. e.  changing the ﬂeet), (2) passing the cost increases
(decreases) to passengers, and (3) hedging fuel costs (Morrell and
Swan, 2006).  Of these, Berghofer and Lucey (2014) ﬁnd that hedging
behavior and changes in ﬂeet diversity do not reduce exposure to the
risk that is associated with changes in oil prices.  Furthermore, hedging
may increase the risk premium and increase costs (Aabo and Simkins,
2005), perhaps by 1% of fuel costs (Rao, 1999).  Despite these costs, the accounting losses of hedging will be more than offset by lower fuel prices,
such that US airlines will save $15 billion (New York Times, 2015). 
Academic research suggests that the degree to which cost increases
(decreases) are passed on to passengers may be inﬂuenced competition
in the airline industry.  High levels of competition make it difﬁcult to
raise ticket prices in response to rising prices for jet fuel (Carter and
Simkins, 2004).  Consistent with this hypothesis, the Portuguese airline
industry could not recover the full cost of higher fuel prices (Button
Name, 2011). 
Recent research indicates that the intensity of competition among
airlines is decreasing.  Concentration in the US airline industry increases
between 2007 and 2009 (Johnston and Ozment, 2011).  The resultant
reduction in competition may slow additions to capacity.  Robert
Mann, a former airline executive states.  “The industry is full at these
prices.  You can't stimulate additional revenue by cutting prices. ” Based
on these concerns, in June 1015, the US Department of Justice opened
an inquiry into whether the airline industry is colluding to limit seating. 
Beyond a reduction in competition, the small effect (to date) of
lower oil prices on airfares could be caused by asymmetric rates of
adjustments in the relation among the price of crude oil, the price of
jet fuel, and airfares.  If the price of jet fuel and/or airfares respond
asymmetrically to changes in crude oil prices (or other components of
the oil market), such that increases in crude oil prices are translated
into higher prices for jet fuel and air travel faster than reductions in
crude oil prices are translated into lower prices for jet fuel and air travel,
the small decline in airfares as of June 2016 (the last month for which
data are available) may be caused by an asymmetric rate of adjustment
to lower prices for crude oil.  This hypothesis echoes an extensive literature on the relation between prices for crude oil and motor gasoline,
which suggests that increases in crude oil prices translate into higher
motor gasoline prices faster than lower crude oil prices translate into
lower motor gasoline prices (e. g.  Perdiguero-Garcia, 2013.  Frey and
Manera, 2007).  This pattern of asymmetric adjustment is termed a
‘rockets and feathers’ effect (Bacon, 1991). 
To test for an asymmetric relation between the price of jet fuel and
air travel, Wadud (2015) uses a method developed by Gately (1992),
which decomposes jet fuel prices into three components.  price rises to
a new all-time high, price declines, and price rises back towards a previous high.  Each of these price changes has a different effect on airfares
such that a one dollar rise in the price of jet fuel to a new all-time high
generates a larger increase in airfares than a one dollar rise in the
price of jet fuel that leaves prices below the previous all-time high
(Wadud, 2015).  These results suggest that the price of jet fuel does
not deﬁne a unique price level for airfares.  That is, the relation between
the price of jet fuel and air travel is ‘path dependent. ’ Although path
dependency could explain the small effect of large reductions in crude
oil prices (if the equilibrium response to price reductions is smaller
than the equilibrium response to price increases), path dependency or
regime change (e. g.  Holmes and Panagiotidis, 2009) are different from
the asymmetric rates of adjustment that are described by the ‘rockets
and feathers’ relation between the price for crude oil and motor
gasoline. 
Here, I test three hypotheses about how the oil market may cause
airfares to fall by a small percentage relative to a large decline in the
price for crude oil. 
1) Airfares adjust very slowly to changes in airfares. 
2) Airfares adjust asymmetrically to changes in the oil market. 
3) The oil market adjusts asymmetrically to changes in the price of
crude oil, and these asymmetric adjustments are communicated
symmetrically to airfares. 
These hypotheses are tested by estimating a cointegrated vector
autoregression (CVAR) model from monthly data.  The cointegrating
relations identify long-run relations for wholesale and retail prices for
jet fuel, inventories of jet fuel, and airfares.  The results indicate that
slow or asymmetric rates of adjustment cannot account for the small
decline in airfares relative to the large drop in crude oil prices. 
Surprisingly, the retail price for jet fuel adjusts faster to reductions in
the price for crude oil, which is opposite the asymmetric rate of
adjustment between prices for crude oil and motor gasoline in many
markets.  I hypothesize that this ‘feathers and rockets’ effect is generated
by the relative rigidity of reﬁnery yields for jet fuel, which generates a
trade-of between the rate at which price changes are passed through
to jet fuel and the reﬁner's cost of holding inventories of jet fuel. 
Together these results indicate that the small decline in airfares cannot
be attributed to relations within the oil market or the relation between
the oil market and airfares.  The failure to identify an oil-related
mechanism for the relatively small decline in airfares does not imply
the converse, that airlines collude to set airfares.  nor does it rule out
collusion. 
These results and the methods used to obtain them are described in
ﬁve sections.  The second section describes the data and the statistical
methodology.  The statistical results are described in the third section. 
Section 4 describes the long-and short-run relations among components of the oil market and their relation with airfares.  Section 5
concludes with a short discussion about what these results imply
about possible causes for the small decline in airfares relative to crude
oil prices. 
<Middle> Methodology. 
2. 1.  Data. 
asymmetries at a weekly or daily frequency, but high frequency
asymmetries could not generate the longer adjustments that are
discussed in the introduction.  I include components of the oil market
beyond the price of jet fuel because previous research suggests that
omitted variables can bias statistical tests for symmetric rates of
adjustment.  Including time series for the inventories of crude oil,
inventories of motor gasoline, and reﬁnery utilization rates in the
cointegrating relations and the error correction models for motor
gasoline prices reduces the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis
of symmetric rates of adjustment (Kaufmann and Laskowski, 2005). 
Data on the U. S.  city average for airline fares (CUSR0000SETG01) are
obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  These data are deﬂated by
monthly values of the U. S.  city average for all items (CUUR0000SA0) to
generate real airfares (Fare). 
Monthly data are compiled for six components of the US oil market. 
(1) the average price of crude oil purchased by reﬁners (PCrude),
(2) inventories of crude oil (CStock), (3) reﬁnery utilization rates
(Util), (4) the wholesale price of jet fuel ( JetW), (5) the retail price of
jet fuel (JetR), and (6) inventories of jet fuel ( JStock).  Observations for
the nominal monthly price of crude oil (dollars per barrel) purchased
by reﬁners (R0000____3) are obtained from the Energy Information
Administration.  The same source is used to compile time series for
the U. S.  kerosene-type jet fuel nominal wholesale/resale price
(EMA_EPJK_PWG_NUS_DPG) by reﬁners (dollars per gallon), U. S. 
fuel nominal retail sale prices by reﬁners
kerosene-type jet
(EMA_EPJK_PTG_NUS_DPG.  dollars per gallon), U. S.  ending stocks
excluding SPR of crude oil (MCESTUS1 thousand barrels), U. S.  Ending
Stocks of Kerosene-Type Jet Fuel (MKJSTUS1 –thousand barrels), and
the US percent utilization of reﬁnery operable capacity (MOPUEUS2). 
Prices for crude oil and jet fuel are deﬂated using the U. S.  city average
for all items that is described above. 1
The availability of observations differs among variables.  Observations for some of the oil-related variables start in the 1970′s, but January
1989 is the ﬁrst observation for airfares.  Conversely, the data for airfares
extend through June 2016, whereas May 2016 is the most recent
observation for some of the oil market variables.  As such, the sample
period includes 329 monthly observations from January 1989 through
May 2016. 
To eliminate the effects on inverting matrices with elements that
differ greatly in size (due to different units of measurement), the time
series for each variable is standardized as follows. 
In which yt is the value (in original units), y is the average value over
the sample period, and Var(y) is the variance over the sample period. 
2. 2.  Statistical methodology. 
The statistical methodology consists of two general stages. 2 In
the ﬁrst stage, I estimate a CVAR model to quantify the long- and
short-run relations among the six components of the oil market and
their relation with airfares.  In the second stage, the long-run relations
are used to calculate the disequilibria in each cointegrating relation,
these disequilibria are decomposed based on the change in the price
of crude oil, and these decomposed disequilibria are used in an error
correction model to test the null hypothesis that variables adjust
symmetrically. 
I compile monthly data on airfares and six components of the oil
market that may affect airfares.  Monthly data likely would fail to detect
In the ﬁrst step, I estimate a CVAR model, for which the general form
is given by,
in which xt is a vector of (p) endogenous variables whose behavior is
being modeled (CStock, Util, JetW, JetR, JStock, and Fare), wt is a vector
of exogenous variables (PCrude), k0 is a vector of constant terms, M is
a vector of eleven dummy variables, one for each month Jan-Nov,
A0,A1,Φ1, Θ,and Π are matrices of regression coefﬁcients, Δ is the ﬁrst
difference operator (Δxt=xt−xt−1), and ε is Niid(0,Ω). 
When the time series are nonstationary, the long-run matrix Π can
be formulated as,
in which α is a p×r matrix of adjustment coefﬁcients (also known as
loadings), β′ is an r×p matrix of cointegration coefﬁcients that deﬁne
stationary deviations from long-run equilibrium relationships, and r is
the number of long-run cointegrating relations. 
The number of cointegrating relations present is given by the rank
(r) of the Π matrix.  The cointegration rank r is determined by solving
an eigenvalue problem in which the eigenvectors are estimates of
β and α =f(β) can be found for a given β.  The eigenvectors, β, are
determined by an orthogonality condition and are ordered according
to their degree of stationarity (Juselius, 2006).  For a more detailed
description of the CVAR model see Juselius (2006). 
Several diagnostic tools are available to determine the rank of Π.  the
most common is the likelihood based trace test (Johansen, 1996), which
tests the null hypothesis of (p-r) unit roots against the alternative
hypothesis of (p− r+ 1) unit roots.  The test procedure is based on a
sequence of tests, starting from r=0 (no stationary relations among
the endogenous and/or exogenous variables), r =1 (p-1 stochastic
trends, one stationary cointegration relation) and ending with (r=p)
(all cointegration relations are stationary).  The test is based on the
null hypothesis of a unit root and, therefore, often has low power to
reject a unit root when the true root is close to the unit circle. 
The second stage tests the null hypothesis that the endogenous
variables adjust symmetrically to disequilibria in each ofcointegrating relations.  This stage uses a four-step procedure (Granger
and Lee, 1989).  (1) using estimates for β to calculate disequilibria in
each cointegrating relation, (2) decomposing these disequilibria based
on changes in the price of crude oil, (3) using these decomposed
disequilibria to estimate an error correction model, and (4) testing
restrictions that impose symmetric rates of adjustment. 
The disequilibria (μ) for each cointegrating relation (r) are calculated
as follows,
in which ^β is the cointegrating vector for cointegrating relation (r)
that is estimated from Eq.  (2). 
In the second step, changes in the price of crude oil are used to
decompose the disequilibria from each cointegrating relation as follows. 
This decomposition is chosen to test the null hypothesis that
changes in the price of crude oil affect the rate at which the oil market
and/or airfares adjust towards equilibrium.  As such, it is similar to the
decomposition used to analyze the relation between the prices for
crude oil and motor gasoline (e. g.  Kaufmann and Laskowski, 2005). 
But this decomposition differs from previous models of asymmetric
price responses, which decompose the residual based on the sign of
the residual (Granger and Lee, 1989) or changes in the residual
(Escribano and Pfann, 1997).  Such speciﬁcations test a different set
of hypotheses, such as whether the rate at which airfares adjust to
conditions in the oil market depends on whether airfares are greater
than or less than the equilibrium value. 
In the third step, the decomposed residuals +εr,t and −εr, t are
speciﬁed in an unrestricted error correction model that is given by, in which τ is a normally distributed random error term.  Eq.  (7) is
estimated using OLS and the standard errors are calculated using the
procedure developed by Newey and West (1987). 
In the ﬁnal step, the null hypothesis that endogenous variable
(x) adjusts symmetrically to disequilibrium in each cointegrating
relation is tested by imposing individual restrictions + γi= −γi.  This
null hypothesis is tested using the F-form of the Wald test, which can
be evaluated against a χ2 distribution with one degree of freedom.  Cook
Name (1999) ﬁnd that this test has a low power to reject the null hypothesis.  This suggests that statistics which reject the null hypothesis at p b
0. 10 may represent cases in which the null hypothesis should be rejected. 
Rejecting the null hypothesis + γi= −γi.  indicates that changes in
the price of crude oil affect the rate at which the dependent variable
adjusts to disequilibrium in cointegrating relation i.  The nature of this
asymmetry is given by the absolute size of + γi relative to −γi.  If
(− 1 b + γi, −γi b0) and (|+ γi, | N|− γi, |) would indicate that the
dependent variable (x) adjusts faster towards equilibrium when the
price of crude oil rises (Fig.  1).  Such a result would be consistent with
the ‘rockets and feathers’ effect. 
3.  Results. 
The rank of the Π matrix is determined using the the trace test.  This
statistic strongly rejects (p b 0. 0001) the null that there are 0, 1, 2, or 3
cointegrating relations, but fails to reject (p N 0. 068) the null hypothesis
that there are four cointegrating relations.  The Π matrix is assigned
a rank of four based on the large increase in the p value from the
ﬁrst four tests (p b 0. 0001) to the test of four cointegrating relations
(p N 0. 068) along with the failure to reject four cointergating relations
at the usual p = 0. 05 signiﬁcance level. 
Identifying the long run structure of the CVAR requires several types
of restrictions (Pesaran and Shin, 1994).  Greenslade Name, (2002)
suggest that the efﬁciency of identifying the long-run structure can be
improved by ﬁrst attempting to reduce the number of endogenous
variables.  I evaluate whether variables can be excluded from the x
vector in Eq.  (2) by testing a restriction that makes all elements of α
equal to zero in the equation for a given endogenous variable.  Results
fail to reject the null hypothesis that the real price of crude oil
(PCrude) is weakly exogenous (Table 1).  For all other variables, the
test statistic rejects the null hypothesis (p b 0. 01).  Furthermore,
for the equation for crude oil prices, I fail to reject a set of restrictions
that makes the elements of the Γ1 matrix associated with the lagged
ﬁrst difference of the six endogenous variable equal(χ2(6)=7. 45,p N0. 28).  Based on these results, the real price of crude
oil is made weakly exogenous by transferring this variable from the x
vector to the w vector in Eq.  (2).  Using this speciﬁcation,impose overidentifying restrictions on the CVAR.  I fail to reject
(χ2(9)=6. 85, p N0. 65) an overidentiﬁed structure that imposes nine
overidentifying restrictions (Table 2).  Each variable is present in one
more or cointegrating relations, which is consistent with exclusion
tests (Table 1). 
The elements of α indicate that each cointegrating relation loads into
the equation for one or more of the variables in the cointegrating
relation in a way that moves that endogenous variable towards the equilibrium value that is implied by the cointegrating relation (Table 2).  This
allows me to interpret each cointegrating relation as a long-run relationship for one or more endogenous variables.  As described in the next section, these interpretations clarify the linkages among components of the
oil market and their relation with airfares. 
Tests of + γi= −γi.  indicate that the assumption of symmetric rates
of adjustment varies across endogenous variables and cointegrating
relations (Table 3).  The null hypothesis of symmetry is rejected (p b
0. 05) for cointegrating relations that load into the equations for reﬁnery
utilization rates, wholesale and retail prices for jet fuel, and inventories
of jet fuel.  Conversely, I cannot reject restrictions that make the equations for inventories of crude oil and airfares adjust symmetrically to
disequilibrium in each cointegrating relation. 
<Conclusion> Discussion. 
4. 1.  Interpreting long-run relations. 
The ﬁrst cointegrating relation (CR #1) in Table 2 includes the price of
crude oil, the wholesale price for jet fuel, and inventories of jet fuel.  Signs
associated with the elements of β indicate a positive relation between the
price of crude oil and the wholesale price for jet fuel and a negative relation between the wholesale price for jet fuel and inventories of jet fuel. 
This negative relation is consistent with cost smoothing by reﬁneries.  Restrictions on the elements of β do not reject the null hypothesis that the
price of crude oil and the wholesale price for jet fuel change on a onefor-one basis (χ2(1)=0. 31,pN0. 86).  Disequilibrium in CR #1 moves the
wholesale price for jet fuel towards the equilibrium level that is implied
by CR #1, but does not move inventories of jet fuel towards the longrun value that is implied by CR #1 (Table 2).  As such, CR #1 is interpreted
as a long-run relation for the wholesale price for jet fuel. 
The second cointegrating relation (CR #2) includes inventories of
crude oil, the wholesale price of jet fuel and the retail prices for jet
fuel.  Elements of β indicate that retail and wholesale prices are positively
related and restrictions on these elements of β fail to reject (χ2(1)=
0.
