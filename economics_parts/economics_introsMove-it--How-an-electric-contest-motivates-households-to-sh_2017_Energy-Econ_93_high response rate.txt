 1.  Introduction Renewable energy sources are increasingly used in order to curb CO2 emissions and mitigate climate change.  In particular, solar photovoltaic systems are being deployed at an exponential rate (see e. g. , IEA, 2016).  However, this technology has the drawback of generating electricity when residential demand is relatively low.  In fact, solar radiation is maximal around noon, when many homes are empty.  Conversely, households’ electricity usage peaks in the evening, when solar radiation is nil.  This mismatch constitutes a potential obstacle to the diffusion of electricity produced from solar sources, even if it can be mitigated in different ways.  Grid expansions would help in transporting electricity for remote consumption.  Storage capacities would allow delayed consumption.  Demand-response measures may be implemented so that electricity is used when and where it is produced.  While the ﬁrst two solutions are supply-side measures requiring high installation costs (Beaudin et al. , 2010) and involving losses (Denholm and Hand, 2011), demand-side management might prove relatively inexpensive and easy to implement.  An additional advantage of demand-side interventions is that they can be implemented rapidly, while deployment of new technologies on a large scale can only be achieved in the long run (Dietz et al. , 2009).  It has also been argued that different solutions like storage and demand management should be considered as complementing each other for grid balancing (Elliott, 2016).  Mitigating imbalances between electricity production and usage is a particularly serious issue in remote areas.  In fact, when large amounts of solar energy are produced in isolated regions at times of low demand, providers may ﬁnd the technical installations necessary to accommodate excess supply too expensive and could prefer to literally destroy the electricity produced. 1 This dismal anecdote illustrates how supply-side measures might fail when it comes to integrating electricity from renewable sources in the grid.  In such situations, demand-side management becomes crucial.  Even if this paper focuses on the misalignment of solar energy production and electricity consumption, its scope extends to the general issue of the increasing importance of renewable technologies.  Because the new renewable energy sources (sun and wind) are intermittent by nature, relying more on these will imply managing demand more actively in order to minimize the cost of using the electricity produced.  In this paper, using a randomized control trial, we investigate whether and by how much households shift intraday electricity usage when provided with incentives to do so.  More precisely, the objective of our intervention is to encourage households to increase their share of electricity used between 11 a. m.  and 3 p. m.  (when most solar radiation takes place), while discouraging any voluntary increase in overall consumption. 2 The ﬁrst treatment consists of information feedback sent monthly via paper mail.  Households included in this group obtain details about their own consumption, its pattern within the day, and similar information about households of comparable size.  The second treatment is a contest in which the best performers (i. e. , those who achieve the strongest shift in electricity usage while keeping total usage at reasonable levels) receive cash prizes determined by their position in the ranking.  Using a difference-in-differences approach, our results suggest that both treatments induce a reaction, but the type of reaction depends on the treatment.  Households exposed to information feedback globally decrease electricity usage regardless of the hours of the day, but they do not shift consumption toward the indicated hours.  Conversely, households exposed to ﬁnancial incentives display a signiﬁcant shift toward the solar energy production hours.  They achieve an increase in their proportion of electricity used between 11 a. m.  and 3 p. m.  by about 1 percentage point, which is not negligible considering this proportion is around 20% on average.  The remainder of the paper unfolds as follows.  Section 2 discusses how our contribution ﬁts into the recent literature.  Section 3 presents our experimental design.  Section 4 describes our dataset and provides a descriptive analysis of the impacts of our intervention.  Section 5 explains our econometric strategy and reports our empirical results.  Section 6 discusses the policy implications and concludes.  2.  Literature review.  Our paper is located at the intersection of two distinct bodies of literature.  The ﬁrst is composed of technical contributions that examine the feasibility of integration of large amounts of variable renewable energy sources (sun and wind) into the energy system (see the review by Kondziella and Bruckner, 2016).  This branch of the literature focuses on engineering solutions and essentially analyzes supply-side measures, whereby the issue is to render electricity distribution amenable through grid expansion and/or storage, and it makes assumptions to simulate consumers’ behavior.  For instance, Denholm and Margolis (2007) evaluate scenarios where up to an arbitrary 10% of demand can be shifted to absorb excess photovoltaic generation, and Steinke et al.  (2013) simply keep demand constant.  In our study, we tackle a similar problem but look at it from an opposite perspective, that is, focusing on demand management.  We obtain exact consumption data and observe actual households’ reaction, but we make simplifying assumptions concerning the supply of renewable energy.  Among the technical studies, Pina et al.  (2012) stand out as they analyze the impact of demand-side management strategies in an electricity mix characterized by high shares of renewable energy.  Their results are nevertheless based on simulations, both for the installation of new generation capacity and for electricity usage.  For example, they assume that because washing machines, dryers, and dishwashers can be easily programmed, these devices will be scheduled to operate when renewable electricity generation is high.  In some of their scenarios, around 40% of these activities are thus shifted.  The assumption that households (and other consumers) will actually change their habits is crucial, but far from obvious.  In the present paper, we are testing this assumption by investigating if and how real households do actually shift load when faced with incentives to do so.  The second relevant branch of the literature is composed of economic studies dealing with the effects of feedback on household electricity demand.  As documented in several literature reviews (Buchanan et al. , 2015.  Faruqui et al. , 2010.  Vine et al. , 2013) and meta-analyses (Delmas et al. , 2013.  Ehrhardt-Martinez et al. , 2010), this research ﬁeld is growing fast. 3 In these contributions, the usual objective is to induce electricity conservation.  Instead, our goal here is to induce load shifting across hours of the day without requiring any decrease (but still prevent increases) in total electricity usage.  As such, the present study is among the ﬁrst economic contributions targeting load shifting, and the main novelty of our intervention is that we intend to attract electricity usage toward some speciﬁc (sunlight) hours instead of trying to push it away from some speciﬁc (peak) hours.  In that sense, our intervention is opposed to the usual paradigm of peak shaving and in fact seeks to create a consumption peak that coincides with the peak of solar energy production.  Other remarkable features of our contribution are the duration of the experiment and the response rate of the pre-experiment survey.  Our experiment was conducted over an exceptionally long period of 18 months.  three months of pre-treatment observation, twelve months of treatment, and three further months of observation after the treatment was terminated.  By comparison, 60% of the studies considered in the meta-analysis by Delmas et al.  (2013) lasted three months or less.  Most studies moreover discontinue observation once the treatment is terminated, so that the availability of a post-treatment observation period is also an exceptional feature.  Furthermore, our pre-experiment survey reached a response rate of about 16%, a considerable ﬁgure when compared to other studies. 4 In Ito et al.  (2015) and Degen et al.  (2013), the response rates are about 1. 7% and 8. 7%, respectively.  Jessoe and Rapson (2014) sent 60,000 e-mails but use only 437 households in their analysis (0. 7%).  A high response rate tends to minimize the self-selection problems that might plague this type of experiment.  Finally, our experiment fulﬁlls all conditions to qualify as a “high-quality study” according to Delmas et al.
