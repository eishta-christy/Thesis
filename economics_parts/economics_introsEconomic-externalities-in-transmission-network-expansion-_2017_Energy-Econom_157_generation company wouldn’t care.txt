The Transmission Network Expansion Planning Problem (TNEPP)
is a classical problem in power electrical engineering and basically
the problem consists in ﬁnding new transmission lines for an adequate operation over a planning horizon.  Traditionally, the problem
was solved as a separate problem from the generation planning
problem1, even though in the early days most electrical systems
operated with a vertical structure and there was a central planner that somehow gave the conditions to coordinate the investment
decisions in transmission and generation. 
At the end of the 1970s competition was introduced in several
electric utilities2.  In this competitive setting, no central planner is
in charge of investments.  Instead, ﬁrst, generation companies decide
their new capacity in function of their expected beneﬁts in the market. 
Then, the transmission company decides the transmission capacity
needed to transmit the energy from the new generators.  In mathematical terms, this interaction can be modeled by multilevel optimization
problems.  In the specialized literature several multilevel models have
been proposed.  an important remark is that the models implicitly assume that the opportunity cost of transmission capacity is
determined by the price difference at the line endpoints 4. 
This paper recognizes that the opportunity cost of transmission
capacity not only depends on the difference of marginal costs at line
endpoints, but also on the location of new generators.  Due to this,
economic externalities arise when investment decisions are decentralized, so that the decentralized result does not lead to a Pareto
optimal solution. 
A good example of externalities in real power systems is the
Peruvian case.  Before 2014, the Peruvian network consisted of two
large areas (North and South) connected through a long transmission line (220 kV, 612 km).  The Southern area imports electricity
from the North.  Moreover, the South has a large source of gas known
as Camisea Gas and a gas pipeline was built in 2004 in order to
deliver gas to the North.  After the entrance of the pipeline, many
generation companies decided to invest in new capacity only in the
North.  however, electricity demand in the South grew and no generation capacity was built there.  Due to this, a new transmission line
(500 kV, 1000 km) between the North and South was placed in service in the year 2014.  Moreover, another line (500 kV, 1000 km)
between the North and South is been constructed and will be placed
in service by the year 2017.  Badly placed generators introduced
negative externalities in the transmission planning.  Obviously, if
generation companies had invested in the South, no transmission
lines would have been needed. 
In this context, we discuss how separating generation expansion
from transmission planning can cause negative externalities to the
transmission planning problem.  The organization of the paper is as
follows.  in Section 2, we discuss how externalities can affect the
TNEPP using a basic model.  in Section 3, we formulate a centralized
multistage model for ﬁnding simultaneous optimal generation and
transmission capacity.  The model is based on previous work of van
der Weijde and Hobbs (2012) and O’Neill Name (2013).  The main purpose of the model is to show examples of externalities.  In Section 4,
we present case studies for the 24-bus test system and the Peruvian
system.  Finally, in Section 5 we present the conclusions of the article. 
2.  A discussion about transmission capacity opportunity cost
and externalities. 
Some articles5 implicitly assume that the opportunity cost of
transmission capacity is determined only by the price difference at
the line endpoints.  That said, the work of the transmission company
is reduced to ﬁnding the set of transmission lines that minimize the
cost of investment added to the cost of operation, taking the future
generation projects as an input.  The above does not take into account
that relocating the future generators could have avoided the construction of additional lines.  This interdependence of transmission
and generation capacity means that decisions in new transmission
and generation capacity must be coordinated to achieve maximum
total surplus. 
To show our reasoning we use a two-bus system in which all the
parameters are certain6.  Consider the example shown in Fig.  1, the
generator at node A has a marginal cost cA = $4/MWh and the generator at node B has a marginal cost cB = $7/MWh.  Node B needs
1000 MW to meet its demand for a period of t = 105 h, this demand
can be supplied either from a new line or a new generator.  Consider
that 1000 MW of transmission capacity can be built with an investment cost of a = $1 × 106.  Also, 1000 MW of generation capacity
can be built at node B with an investment cost of b = $200 × 106
and a marginal cost of cC = $3/MWh.  Let us ﬁnd the Pareto optimal
solution. 
The demand is modeled as depicted in Fig.  2.  in which electricity demand d is constant (inelastic) until the price reaches a
certain value called the Value of Lost Load (VOLL).  Above the VOLL
the consumers are not willing to pay and a load curtailment r must
be considered.  This is an acceptable approximation for real-world
electricity demand7. 
The total surplus in the model is given by the area below the
demand considering a t number of hours of operation minus the
operation cost OC of running the generators and the investment cost
IC of building new capacity in the electrical system. 
Surplus = voll •(d − r)t − (OC + IC)The power ﬂow of the line is given by fAB (from A to B), power produced by generators A, B and C are given by gA, gB and gC respectively. 
Then, at each node the sum of power ﬂows must be zero. 
Node B.  d − r = gB + gC + fABWe represent the investment decision in the transmission line
with a binary variable y, with investment cost a.  While the decision
variable for investing in a generator is represented with the binary
variable w, with investment cost b. 
Note that gB and fab can be zero depending on the binary variables. 
For the candidate generators we relate their production with their
capacity limits multiplied by the binary variable w, if the generator
is not built its production is zero. 
The same reasoning is made for the transmission line, if the line
is not built then power ﬂow is zero. 
Let us simplify the objective function of the model.  Since d is
a parameter for the problem it can be neglected from the objective function without changing the result.  Also, the maximization
problem can be expressed as a minimization of the negative of the
objective function.  Then, the objective function can be rewritten as
follows. 
The operation cost is given by the production of each generator
multiplied by its respective marginal cost. 
The investment cost is given by the investment cost in the transmission line plus the investment cost in the generator multiplied by
their respective binary variables. 
Finally, gathering the objective function with the restrictions we
have the following optimization problem. 
The time horizon is divided into a set of stages or years, YT. 
each stage has an annual duration curve.  The investments in new
transmission and generation capacity are made at the beginning of
each stage and then the network operates with this new stock of
equipment until the next stage (Fig.  3). 
The variables of the problem are gA, gB, gC, fAB, w and y.  For this
small electrical system, we simply compute with a spreadsheet the
overall cost for each option considering dispatch of the generators in
order of marginal cost.  The results are shown in Table 1. 
Now, for the same problem consider that the investment cost in
the new generator is reduced to $100 × 106, the new results are
shown in Table 2. 
It can be seen that the solution (investments) change from one
case to another even if the marginal costs do not change.  Also, we
see that it is always useful to compare the cost of a new line with the
cost of a new local generator.  For large systems, this is equivalent to
minimizing the investment costs in transmission and generation in
the same problem. 
In a decentralized market, generation companies make their
investment decisions in generation capacity without taking into
account the transmission investment cost nor the possible load
curtailment.  After this, the transmission company makes its investments.  As a result of the process, the generation investment
level introduces negative externalities to the transmission planning
problem. 
<Middle> A model for simultaneous optimal planning of transmission
and generation capacity. 
We formulate a centralized multistage stochastic model that ﬁnds
the Pareto optimal solution for a considered planning horizon using
a DC formulation of network ﬂows, the model is based in the work of
van der Weijde and Hobbs (2012) and O’Neill Name (2013)8.  In Table 3
we present the notation used. 
For each year, the annual duration curve (Fig.  4) is decomposed
in a set of discrete blocks of demand YU, in where the width of each
block is the associated number of hours tu and the height of the block
represents the inelastic part of the curve demand depicted in Fig.  2. 
We consider future demand as uncertain9, for each block of
demand a number of scenarios could be possible,which is represented by the set of scenarios YS,where each scenario has a probability ps.  At this point we identify the recourse variables of the
stochastic problem, which are the variables that change with the scenario.  All variables that are related to the operation of the network
(production, power ﬂows of the lines, load curtailment, etc) are the
recourse variables.  We will denote those variables with the s superscript.  Also, the investment variables do not depend on the scenarios
since we have built the lines and generators before the realization of
a particular scenario. 
The model considers a set of nodes, YN, each node i ∈ YN has a
i,u,t for the demand block u ∈ YU, for the stage t ∈ YT and
demand ds
for the scenario s ∈ YS.  Also, each node i ∈ YN has an angle, hsfor the demand block, u ∈ YU, stage t ∈ YT and scenario s ∈ YS.  We
deﬁne a reference node (slack bus) so that hs
The existing transmission lines are represented by the set YL,
each line ij ∈ YL represents a line between nodes i and j.  Each line has
a susceptance, bij, and a ﬁxed capacity, f max
.  Each existing line ij has
a power ﬂow f 0,s
ij,u,t, for each demand block u, at staget for scenario s. 
The existing generators are represented by the set YG.  Existing
generators k ∈ G have a marginal cost, pk, and capacity, gmaxexisting generator produces power g0,s
k,u,t, for each demand block u, at
stage t for scenario s. 
The transmission candidates are represented by the set YLnew .  For
each candidate ij ∈ YLnew , a binary variable yij,t represents investment
decisions at stage t ∈ YT with an investment cost cij.  Power ﬂows
for candidate transmission lines ij are given by f s
ij,u,t, for the demand
block u, stage t and scenario s.  In some equations we will use the set
Li, which denotes the subset of lines ij connected to the node i. 
Generator candidates are represented by a set YGnew .  For each
candidate k ∈ YGnew , a binary variable wk,t represents an investment
decision at stage t ∈ YT with cost 4k, marginal cost of generation
pk and capacity gmaxfor the demand block u, stage t and scenario s.  It is considered that
the units’ lifetimes are longer than the planning horizon so we do
not consider aging.  In some equations we will use the set YGi , that
denotes the subset of generators connected to node i. 
.  A candidate generator produces power, gsLet us derive the investment cost in transmission capacity IT. 
Since the variable yij is the stock of lines at a particular stage, the
investments at each stage is given by the difference of the stock of
lines between the current stage and the previous stage, the cost for
each line is given by the binary variable times the associated cost cij. 
Similarly, the investment cost in generation capacity IG is the
following. 
Note that the operation cost is given by the production cost of
the existing generators plus the production cost of new generators
(if available) plus the cost of lost load.  For a particular scenario the
operation cost OCs is the following. 
Then the expected cost for the planning horizon is the following. 
Then, the objective is to minimize the investment cost in transmission, generation and the expected cost of operation taking into
account the cost of possible lost load, this approach is equivalent to
the welfare maximization approach as shown in Section 2.  The objective function represents the present value of the investment cost in
transmission and generation and the operation cost for the planning
horizon. 
The constraints are the following. 
• Inter-temporal constraint to take into account that a generator
built at stage t is available at stage t + 1
wk,t−1 ≤ wk,t
, k ∈ YGnew , t ∈ YT|t > 1• Inter-temporal constraint to take into account that a transmission line built at stage t is available at stage t + 1. 
The following constraints are valid for all the scenarios s∀s ∈ YS,
for all demand blocks ∀u ∈ YU and for all stages ∀t ∈ YT. 
• Ohm’s law for existing transmission lines, the power ﬂow is
proportional to the susceptance of the line. 
• Ohm’s law for candidate transmission lines.  Notice that the
Ohm’s law was linearized using the Fortuny-Amat representation with a parameter M = p10
• Capacity limit for existing transmission lines.

where g0,s
k,u,t are nonnegative continuous variables and wk,t
and yij,t are binary variables.  The model corresponds to a mixedinteger linear programming problem. 
4.  Case studies. 
The proposed model has been formulated in the AMPL modeling
programming language and solved with CPLEX 12. 4. 6 solver.  For all
the calculations we used a per unit system with base power of 100
MVA.  It is important to mention that for the implementation of the
model two separate sets were used for the existing and candidate
equipment, this formulation gave us better computing performance
(e. g.  the computational time reduced from hours to minutes for the
Peruvian system) compared to the traditional modeling that considers that existing and candidate equipment are in the same set,
this is mostly because usually candidate equipment for expansion is
much less than the existing equipment. 
4. 1.  IEEE 24-bus system. 
The aim of this case study is to show how a decentralized outcome
can have a greater total cost than a centralized solution.  The data
for the system is presented in Tables 4–7.  The parameters n0Table 4 represents the number of existing lines for corridor i–j.  Only
one candidates can be built for each corridor with the exception of
corridors 15–21, 20–23, 7–8 and 3–24 in which we considered that
two lines could be built.  For the sake of simplicity, we consider just
one demand block with t = 8760 h.  We consider data for one stage
that will repeat for ten years, so the number of hours is multiplied
by 10.  Also, we consider two demand scenarios with probabilities
ps=1 = 0. 7 andp s=2 = 0. 3. 
First, we get the centralized solution with the model and then we
get a decentralized outcome and we compare the results. 
The results are shown in Tables 8–10.  For the centralized solution,
the optimal generation expansion consists of two units at node 10.  In
order to get a decentralized solution, a multilevel-level model could
be formulated.  Instead, we take advantage of the symmetry of the
problem.  all marginal costs of generators are the same and investors
face the same ﬁxed costs for all the projects, since the marginal costs
at all buses would be the same, a generation company wouldn’t care
about the location of the new generators.  If we assume that proﬁts
are higher than the opportunity costs for the investors, they would
build any combination of available generation projects to meet the
demand.
