 1.  Introduction Energy supply and production disruptions can have severe consequences in the entire economy.  For example, the natural gas supply disruptions experienced by Argentina in 2004 led to power generation shortages for the industrial and residential demands, leading to signiﬁcant impacts the national economy (Honoré, 2004).  The Northeast power outage of 2003 in the U. S.  affected more than 55 million people and resulted in estimated $10 billion economic losses (Liscouski and Elliot, 2004).  The topic of energy resilience (e. g. , FLYNN, 2012) has received much attention in the recent decades in the study of energy security (e. g. , IEA, 2014.  Vivoda, 2010.  Lefèvre, 2010.  Scheepers et al. , 2007.  Ang et al. , 2015).  The Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD, 2013) deﬁnes resilience as “the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions.  resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover from deliberate attacks, accidents, or naturally occurring threats or incidents”.  Molyneaux et al.  (2012) states that “resilience is the ability to absorb shocks and still retain function”.  Haimes (2009) deﬁned resilience as the “ability of system to withstand a major disruption within acceptable degradation parameters and to recover with a suitable time and reasonable costs and risks”.  Hence, the ability of an economy to recover its essential function of energy supply and production is of fundamental interest in the study of energy resilience.  Despite various attempts to characterize or deﬁne energy resilience, its quantiﬁcation is not straightforward.  Many aforementioned efforts proceed by evaluating performance and contributions from various infrastructural, economic and geographical perspectives, and then aggregating them into a form of composite indicator, for the purpose of comparison and ranking of energy resilience and security (e. g. , see Vivoda, 2010.  Molyneaux et al. , 2012.  Kruyt et al. , 2009).  However, a common critique of such approaches is that there can be signiﬁcant inﬂuence of subjective judgement, e. g.  in determining the relative importances of aggregating various performance indicators.  More importantly, energy-economic systems are generally highly inter-connected, and hence many economic sectors can simultaneously suffer the consequences of energy disruptions (e. g.  in the form of production losses).  Furthermore, the sectoral interdependencies can result in an unforeseen cascade of consequences, due to a seemingly isolated disruption event.  In a similar manner, post-disruption energy-economic recovery is highly dependent on the inter-sectoral connectivities.  Finally, energy resilience can also depend on the speciﬁc energy sectors disrupted, and often, there is limited a priori information or data to suggest which energy sectors are the most vulnerable targets of attack.  Motivated by the above issues, in this paper we propose an Input-Output linear programming model to study the relationships between energy production disruptions, impacts on sectoral production and demands, and post-disruption recovery efforts.  Despite some of their limitations, Input-Output models continue to be widely-adopted and useful formats to depict inter-sectoral dependencies in the economy and energy emission studies (Su and Ang, 2012.  Su and Ang, 2015.  Hoekstra, 2010.  Hawkins et al. , 2015).  Many countries and states have continued to collect, publish and update data for calibrating Input-Output tables (e. g. , 43 countries’ time series IO data in World Input-Output Database Timmer et al. , 2016).  Our proposed methodology uses the economic Input-Output structure, in the format of a linear programming model, to evaluate the impact of a given energy sector’s output disruption on all other sectors’ total outputs and ability to fulﬁl ﬁnal goods demands.  Since energy production disruptions can arise from different sectors (possibly simultaneously) and cannot be anticipated precisely in advance, our proposed model evaluates the maximum impact on the economy, in the form of ﬁnal demand deﬁcits, over a set of (possibly inﬁnite) production disruption scenarios.  Our model also includes production recovery assumptions, so that after the energy disruption event, production is allowed to gradually recover, the rate of which depends on the level of recovery investments assumed.  Finally, the above components are combined to deﬁne the energyeconomic resilience of the system under study, which is essentially related to the minimum level of extrinsic resource recovery investments required to restore the production levels suﬃciently, such that the total economic impacts do not exceed a stipulated level over a stipulated post-disruption duration.  This provides decisionmakers with a simple way to evaluate, compare and rank the energy resilience of a given (set of) Input-Output system(s) under various scenario assumptions.  Moreover, our methodology can be used to identify the most vulnerable sectors at different levels of disruptions.  The main contributions of this work are as follows.  (a) A novelty in our proposed approach is the use of the level of required recovery efforts as a measure of energy resilience such that it only requires speciﬁcations such as the impact level of disruption, the level of acceptable demand deﬁcits and the post-disruption duration which are much more concrete and easier to elicit from stakeholders.  Besides, by using minimum required recovery efforts as the surrogate for the energy resilience, our methodology bypasses several diﬃculties in modelling energy resilience since in reality, data relating restoration investments to production recovery speeds are difﬁcult to obtain and calibrate.  (b) Our model correctly captures the physical realities of supply and demand balances during a disruption and can evaluate the maximum impact arising from an arbitrarily large set of disruption scenarios without applying single-scenarioa-time analysis nor relying on Monte Carlo methods compared to other works in recovery modelling.  (c) We show that our proposed model can be reformulated and solved as a sequence of mixed integer programming models, which can be eﬃciently accomplished by commercial solvers such as CPLEX.  This is computationally attractive compared to more complex but highly non-linear models (see e. g.  Reed et al. , 2009.  Vugrin and Camphouse, 2011).  (d) We show that the critical energy disruptions can depend on both the intersectoral dependencies and the scale of the disruption.  This implies that anticipating and predicting critical sectors (e. g.  for fortiﬁcation purposes) generally cannot be accomplished by simply inspecting and analyzing the Input-Output data.  Besides, resorting to brute force scenario enumeration can become practically infeasible for large systems.  These considerations collectively provide justiﬁcation why automated decision analytics provided by our methodology play an important role in energy resilience studies.  The outline of the paper is as follows.  The next section reviews the literature of related works in the application of Input-Output models and their extensions for energy studies, and also the use of linear programming models in Input-Output analysis.  Section 3 introduces our proposed basic model to compute ﬁnal demand deﬁcits incurred after disruption, the uncertainty model for deﬁning the production disruption scenarios, the model to evaluate the maximum demand deﬁcit, and the proposed energy-economic recovery resilience.  Moreover, to evaluate the maximum impact of the economic system from the uncertain set of production disruption scenarios, we propose an equivalent formulation of the model in the format of a mixed integer linear programming model.  In Section 4, a case study using China 2012 Input-Output data is used to illustrate our methodology in further details.  Finally, Section 5 presents the concluding remarks and suggestions for the future research.  2.  Literature review.  In the past three decades, the Leontief Input-Output model (Leontief, 1986) has been widely used to study energy and economical issues (see the articles, Su and Ang, 2012.  Hoekstra, 2010.  Hawkins et al. , 2015).  Moreover, combining linear programming with Input-Output modelling is a popular approach to study various energy-economy-environment problems in the research literature.  For instance, Wang and Miller (1995) proposed an Input-Output linear programming model to analyze the economic impact of a transportation and energy supply bottleneck on the economy of Taiwan.  Leung and Hsu (1984) proposed the use of an linear programming model to study the economic impacts of energy supply reductions on the Hawaiian economy.  Rose et al.  (1997) used an Input-Output linear program to study the regional economic impact of an earthquake and they found a disruption in electricity was caused by reallocation of the scarce electricity across sectors could reduce the impacts substantially.  Input-Output analysis is also frequently used to assess the economy recovery following disasters.  Hallegatte (2008) applied InputOutput analysis to the landfall of Katrina in Louisiana by taking into account changes in production capacity due to productive losses and adaptive behaviour in the aftermath of a disaster.  Li et al.  (2013) developed a theoretical route map for imbalanced economic recovery called dynamic inequalities based on Input-Output model and applied it to a hypothetical post-disaster economic scenario of ﬂooding in London to assess the inﬂuence of shocks to a regional economy.  Separately, Haimes and Jiang (2001) and Santos and Haimes (2004) used an extension of Leontief Input-Output (i. e. , inoperability InputOutput and dynamic inoperability Input-Output) to quantify the economic losses triggered by terrorism and other disruptive events to economic systems (or industry sectors) where the economic Input-Output data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis was incorporated into the model for economic impact analysis.  The various applications of inoperability Input-Output models can be found in Crowther and Haimes (2005), Crowther et al.  (2007), Anderson et al.  (2007), and Barker and Haimes (2009).  The main strength of the Input-Output approach is in that it enables the analyst to differentiate and quantify impacts in different sectors, through diverse channels of causality, and across regions, though the data required to accomplish that fully are quite extensive (Okuyama and Santos,There are also some published works proposing Input-Output linear programming models to study the recovery of interconnected system due to disruptions.  For instance, Tan (2011) developed an optimization model with inoperability constraints to determine the optimal allocation of various energy sources within a system to corresponding energy sinks or demands, while ensuring that inoperability limits of the latter are satisﬁed for multiple enumerated scenarios.  MacKenzie et al.  (2014) proposed static and dynamic models to determine the optimal resource allocation to facilitate the recovery of impacted industries after a disruption where the objective is to minimize the production losses due to the disruption.  equilibrium, the output from each sector i should match the intermediate demands from all other sectors j for goods i (including itself) and ﬁnal demands fi.  Suppose a production disruption level of 4i has taken place in sector i at a certain point in time (e. g.  t = 0), so that the production level falls to ˆxi − 4i.  Production disruptions in this paper are assumed to be consequences of disruptions in the production capacity of the sector (e. g.  due to attacks on the critical production infrastructures), so that the sector is inhibited from producing at levels greater than ˆxi − 4i.  A supply-demand gap will then appear and the balance in Eq.  (2) cannot be achieved with the equilibrium levels of production outputs ˆx and ﬁnal demands f.  Without any further intervention, the impact on the economy post-disruption is a reduction in all other production outputs due to the inter-sectoral Input-Output dependencies, and consequently compromising the fulﬁlment of the ﬁnal demands.  A new equilibrium is then reached when the ﬁnal demand levels are reduced suﬃciently.  The ﬁnal demands that has been compromised from its original levels in this manner is termed as demand deﬁcits in this work.  Next, we assume that after the disruption event, recovery efforts are initiated to restore the production of the disrupted sector to its original equilibrium level.  In reality, the length of the recovery process depends on the effectiveness of the restoration efforts.  As the disrupted sector gradually recovers, the production levels of all other sectors are also restored to their original equilibrium levels.  Based on the above context, we introduce the following InputOutput linear programming model to describe the recovery of the production levels that minimizes the total demand deﬁcits over a horizon of T time periods after the disruption event.  Baghersad and Zobel (2015) used Input-Output linear programming to investigate the economic consequences of production capacity bottlenecks caused by disasters.  They also consider recovery operations within disrupted sectors, from the standpoint of evaluating the performance of the economy during the transition period after a disaster.  While the above works focus on combining Input-Output models with linear programming techniques to analyze the impact of energy supply shortage (e. g. , oil and electricity disruption) on national economy, they did not consider the issues of the uncertain nature of disruption events.  In this work, our models explicitly address the disruption uncertainties and incorporate the mechanisms to evaluate energy-economic resilience.  In our opinion, issues of energy supply disruption and energy resilience under uncertainty are of greater interest from the energy security aspect, and worthy of a more rigorous and technical approach of study.  This paper is more than an extension of the work by He on energy imports resilience evaluation using an Input-Output with linear programming model.  it is a generalization of He as we now explicitly consider the post-disruption recovery of output and use the recovery effort concept to motivate and deﬁne our notion of resilience here, which is much more complicated and broader in scope than the previous<Middle> Methodology.  In this section, we present the models used to characterize the inter-sectoral dependencies, energy production disruptions and post-disruption recovery.  These are then combined to deﬁne our proposed energy-economic resilience evaluation model.  The key notations in this paper are shown in Table 1.  Other notation will be deﬁned as when appropriate and necessary.  3. 1. 1.  Model description.  The basic Leontief Input-Output model depicts the inter-sectoral relationship between goods producing sectors in an economy through the supply-demand balance equation where ˆx is the N × 1 vector of sectors’ outputs in an economy of n sectors, A = [aij] is the Leontief technical coeﬃcient matrix, and f is the N-vector of ﬁnal demands.  Eqs.  (1) and (2) basically state that in here.  In the above model, the objective function (3) minimizes the total ﬁnal demand deﬁcits si,t over all sectors and time periods up to T.  Constraint (4) is an extension of the Leontief Input-Output Eq.  (1), speciﬁed for each time period t, and says that the production of sector i in period t should match the corresponding intermediate demands from all sectors, plus the compromised ﬁnal demands fi − si,t.  Constraint (5) depicts the production capacity recovery model, where the variable ri,t is deﬁned as the total recovered production capacity up to t in sector i.  Hence, in each period t, the recovered capacity increases by a component proportional to the demand deﬁcit level si,t, which can also be regarded as the supply-demand gap in the Input-Output equation in Constraint (4).  The non-negative recovery rate coeﬃcient ki determines the speed of recovery of the sector, and is deﬁned as the production capacity recovered per unit deﬁcit per unit time.  Clearly, the larger the value of ki, the faster the capacity recovery.  Also, when the demand-supply gap in sector i is eliminated, si,t = 0, no further capacity recovery takes place.  We further discuss on Constraint (5) later in this section.  Constraint (6) states that, the sector i(cid. 5)s output at time t is not greater than the production capacity available (immediately after disruption plus that recovered).  Deﬁning ri,0 = 0, it means that immediately after the disruption at t = 0, the remaining production capacity sector in i is ˆxi − 4i ˆxi.  Constraint (7) states that the demand deﬁcits are bounded above by the ﬁnal demand levels f, or equivalently, that all compromised ﬁnal demands fi − si,t are non-negative.  Note that if sit = fi for all i, for some t, then all production in the economy seizes, i. e.  x = 0.  Finally, Constraint (8) are non-negativity constraints for the decision variables.  We next give some further explanation and justiﬁcation for the capacity recovery model in the above formulation.  In particular, it is easy to see that Constraint (5) describes a ﬁrst-order difference system (e. g. , see Salamon, 1996) for modelling the production capacity recovery dynamics, which in general is an approximation to realworld recovery dynamics.  Although it is rather simple in structure, the linear difference system still provides many interesting insights and has been applied in many areas to model the recovery processes.  For instance, Davidson and Çagnan (2004) validated that the postearthquake recovery of lifeline systems such as electricity and water supply follows a ﬁrst-order exponential trajectory.  Priest et al.  (1996) used a ﬁrst-order linear system to model the recovery from medical conditions.  We also note that some works proposed the dynamic Leontief input output based models (including so called inoperability models) to model the output recovery from a supply disruption (Lian and Haimes, 2006).  However, those models in our opinion do not respect the physical reality of interest here.  For instance, if there is a disruption in sector i(cid. 5)s output, then other sectors requiring goods from sector i could suffer from a loss of inputs and consequently they cannot support their original levels of production outputs.  Such realities however do not seem to hold in general for the models proposed in the aforementioned work.  Our proposed Models (3)– (8) can be easily extended to account for many different issues with the modiﬁcations of the constraints or objective function.  For example, considerations such as buffer production capacity can be included as a decision variable in Constraint (6), and does not change the concept of the approach.  It can also be extended to include production stockpiles such as strategic reserves explicitly in Constraint (4), which is also an important instrument in mitigating energy disruptions.  In this work, we focus on the basic models (3)–(8) for the purpose of presenting our methodology clearly.  3. 1. 2.  A simple three-sector example.  To reinforce the ideas of the proposed Models (3)–(8), in the following we use a three-sector example for illustration.  The three sectors are.  Manufacturing (i = 1), Energy e. g. , oil, gas, coke, petroleum (i = 2), and Electricity (i = 3).  The Input-Output table is shown in Table 2 and the corresponding technical coeﬃcient matrix A = [aij]The output recovery path (xi,t) and ﬁnal demand deﬁcit (si,t) for disruption in Manufacturing, Energy and Electricity sector in turn, are plotted in the Figs.  1, 2 and 3 respectively, assuming a T = 50week horizon and ki = 0. 2.  The disruption level 4i is assumed to be 10% for each sector.  From Fig.  1, after the disruption in Manufacturing sector, all three sectors’ production recover gradually and approach their original levels, and demand deﬁcits only appear in the disrupted Manufacturing sector and decreases as the production recovers.  For Electricity and Energy sectors, their demand deﬁcits are zero since their production levels, although decreased as a consequence of their inputs from Manufacturing being disrupted, are still suﬃcient to balance intermediate consumptions and ﬁnal demands.  The total demand deﬁcits is 72,928 (millions CNY) in this scenario.  In contrast, from Fig.  2, when the disruption occurs in the Energy sector, demand deﬁcits appear in both Energy and Electricity sectors.  The obvious reason is that since Electricity sector is heavily reliant on inputs such as coal, oil and gas from the Energy sector, the latter’s disruption impacts electricity production so severely that ﬁnal demands for electricity cannot be met.  Finally, when the same level of disruption happens in Electricity sector, demand deﬁcits appear in all the three sectors.  This is a consequence of the fact that both the other two sectors are heavily reliant on Electricity sector for their inputs.  The total demand deﬁcits is 3086 (millions CNY) in this scenario.  3. 2.  A model for evaluating maximum disruption impacts.  3. 2. 1.  Model description.  From the aforementioned example, it can be seen that the consequence and impact of the disruption can be sensitive to the disruption scenario considered (i. e.  which sector(s) is (are) disrupted).  In the example, the disruption, when taking place in the Manufacturing sector, resulted in the largest level of demand deﬁcits, which was also entirely concentrated in the demand of Manufacturing goods.  When disruptions occurred in the other sectors, the total deﬁcits were lower, but more sectors’ ﬁnal demands were compromised.  In this section, we will evaluate the maximum impact of disruptions across many different possible disruption scenarios.  In this work we use the total demand deﬁcits incurred to deﬁne the impact of the disruption.  In reality, production disruptions can take place in any sector or many sectors simultaneously.  The disruptions can be deliberate (e. g. , terrorist attacks) or non-deliberate (e. g. , careless accidents, natural catastrophes).  Production disruptions generally can also have very little historical bearing.  In particular, it can be diﬃcult to ascertain the occurrence likelihood of a disruption scenario.  With these considerations, we deﬁne the following set of possible disruption scenarios parameterized by the severity parameter h.  In the above, 4i refers to the level of disruption of sector i, expressed as a proportion of the original equilibrium levels ˆxi, and thus 4ithe actual disruption level.  Y(h) describes the set of all disruption scenarios 4 such that the total number of sectors disrupted in the economy is no more than hN.  The parameter h can thus be used to deﬁne different sets of disruption scenarios corresponding to different severity levels of the disruption.  For instance, when h = 0, Y(h) reduces trivially to a singleton, i. e.  Y(h = 0) ={ 0}, which means simply that there are no disruptions, while Y(h = 1) corresponds to the largest set of scenarios where all the N sectors can be fully disrupted.  Using the above the production disruption scenario set Y(h), we can now evaluate the maximum demand deﬁcit using the following optimization model.  where M is a suﬃciently large positive constant.  As can be seen, the above formulation we considered is a general case where hN can be non-integer.  Hence, the optimal solution in the above outer maximization ∗, can be regarded as the ‘most critical’ disruption problem, say 4 scenario, since it results in the highest impact (i. e.  maximum demand deﬁcits).  We now consider the approach of solving Model (10).  First, note that if the number of disruption scenarios 4 is small, the maxmin problem can be solved by simply ﬁxing 4 and then solving the inner linear programming model in turn.  The maximum demand deﬁcits is then determined by inspecting the largest deﬁcits across all the scenarios.  The above model, however, describes the maximization over an inﬁnite set of 4 arising from the polyhedral set Y(h).  A possible ad-hoc approach can then be to randomly sample scenarios from Y(h), evaluate them, and then obtain the maximum demand deﬁcits.  Such an approach however, unavoidably contains sampling errors and poses the danger of missing out very critical scenarios, unless an extremely large number of scenarios are considered.  The max-min problem in Eq.  (10) is a speciﬁc instance of a two-stage adaptable robust linear optimization problem, which is computationally intractable in general (see e. g.  Ben-Tal et al. , 2009).  Based on the speciﬁcation of the Y(h) in Eq.  (9) we are able to show that the max-min problem in Eq.  (10) can be converted into a single instance of a linear mixed integer programming problem, which can then be handled quite eﬃciently using powerful commercial solvers such as CPLEX.  This reformulation is presented in the following proposition.  Proposition 1.  Solving problem Eq.  (10) is equivalent to solving the following mixed integer program Eqs.  (11)–(19).  By applying Proposition 1, the original problem can be reformulated to a solvable linear mixed integer program with which we are able to deﬁne the energy recovery resilience in the next subsection.  The practical implication of this result is that the evaluation of the max-min model can now be performed exactly, and need not rely on sampling approaches, which unavoidably introduces sampling3. 2. 2.  Three-sector example.  evaluating critical disruptions and maximum deﬁcits.  We continue to use the three-sector example in Section 3. 1. 2 to illustrate the application of the maximum demand deﬁcits model (10).  Assume ki = 0. 2 for each sector i, andT = 50.  The results under different disruption severity levels h • N are shown in Table 3.  As can be seen, the maximum demand deﬁcits generally increase as h increases.  The columns 4 Elec depict the critical disruption scenario.  It can be observed that, when h • N is not greater than 0. 3, disruption in Manufacturing sector causes the largest impact, and only ﬁnal manufacturing demands are compromised.  When the total disruption level is greater than 0. 4, disruption in Electricity sector is the most impactful, and all demand deﬁcits appear across all three sectors.  This suggests that identifying the critical disruption scenario is not always straightforward.  indeed the critical disruption scenario not only depends on the Input-Output relationship of the sectors, but can also depend on the severity of the disruption considered.  This is an important information for policy-makers interested in identifying critical sectors to fortify.  Generally, it may not be immediately obvious what causes the ‘switching’ of the critical disruption sectors.  Such characteristic however can be explained using linear programming concepts based on the model (10), the details of which is available in the Appendix section for the interested readers.  Clearly, larger values of recovery rate coeﬃcients k can result in faster production recoveries and smaller demand deﬁcits.  Table 4 illustrates some of these results by varying the level of k.  However, larger values of k imply greater levels of extrinsic support for recovery, and can be prohibitively expensive in practice.  These issues are further discussed in the next section.  3. 3.  Energy-economic recovery resilience.  In models (3)–(8), post-disruption recovery of the economic system is enabled through the ﬁrst-order production capacity restoration function in Eq.  (5), and clearly, how fast the economy regains its initial equilibrium depends on the assumed values of the recovery rate parameters k, where larger values of k implies that a higher proportion of the existing demand-supply gap can be closed over the same duration.  A practical challenge in using models (3)–(8) (and by extension the maximum demand deﬁcits model (10)) directly is on the estimation and choice of the values of k used.  This can be done, for example, if one has the luxury of the data regarding the production restoration efforts from past disruption incidents.  Generally, larger values of k suggest higher levels of resource investments for developing the restoration capability.  For instance, more recovery crews, higher availability of repair equipment and capabilities will be needed for rapid restoration of transmission lines or power generators following an electricity supply disruption.  In practice, many such recovery resources need to be developed or acquired before disruptions occur.  An important question that one may then pose is, can two economies with similar recovery rate parameters k, but different inter-sectoral dependencies (i. e.  the Input-Output matrix A), have different post disruption economic recovery performance.  Based on the above considerations, in this section we propose an extension of Model (10), to evaluate the energy recovery resilience of the economy.  This proposed model assumes a speciﬁed deﬁcit budget t, which is deﬁned as the maximum permissible total demand deﬁcits incurred over the post-disruption horizon of T time periods.  The model is deﬁned as follows.  The optimal objective function value V(h, t) in Eq.  (20) is the minimum total level of k required by the economy to ensure that total demand deﬁcits are not greater than t, over T time periods post disruption, where the disruption is any scenario from Y(h).  Hence, V(h, t) can be viewed as a surrogate of a least cost investment in production recovery capability while meeting demand deﬁcits requirements.  We also deﬁne the energy-economic recovery resilience as this.  Given a value of k, the left hand side of Eq.  (21) computes the maximum deﬁcits level, that is, the model (10).  In Eq.  (22) we assume that k is bounded above by 1 (i. e.  capacity recovery is at 100% of the demand-supply gap), although generally any other upper bounds can be used.  In summary, Models (20)–(22) can be used to rank different economic structures (speciﬁcally, corresponding to different Leontief matrice A) in their recovery resilience.  For example, one may consider a scenario analysis of switching power generation from coal-ﬁring to nuclear-ﬁring technology in a given economy.  This will result in a change of the generation mix and essentially some of the entries of A.  Models (20)–(22) is then solved for the corresponding q values prior and after the technology change.  Larger values of q implies a more resilient system, since it requires lower exogenous investments k to achieve the same demand deﬁcits requirements.  Furthermore, we highlight that a practical advantage of models (20)– (22) is that we do not need to calibrate or estimate the k in advance, which can be extremely diﬃcult due to lack of data.  Instead, the model chooses for us the optimal values.  As a trade-off, we need to specify t in the model.  However, t in our opinion is much easier to solicit from the model users.  If that is also not possible, still, performing scenario analysis with different values of t is quite straightforward (compared to that using k).  3. 4.  Solving the energy-economic recovery model.  We now consider the solution approach of the models (20)–(22).  Deﬁne V as the set of all vertices v in the set Y(h), and A(4, k) as the polyhedral set.  Deﬁning ¯V ⊆ V, we term the following as the master problem.  When ¯V = V, master problem (23)–(26) indeed is equivalent to the energy recovery resilience models (20)–(22).  These are stated in the following technical results, the proofs of which are found in Appendix A. 2 and A. 3.  Proposition 2.  Consider the maximum demand deﬁcits model (10).  There exist some extreme point v ∈ V , so that4 = v is an optimal solution (i. e.  the critical disruption scenario) in Eq.  (10).  Proposition 3.  The formulations (23)–(26), with lent to the energy recovery resilience models (20)–(22).  Formulations (23)–(26) is the basis of implementing an iterative cutting plane solution approach, where instead of having ¯V = V, which generally consists of an exponentially large number of constraints (due to the large size of the vertex set V), we solve Eqs.  (23)–(26) using a small subset ¯V, solve for a value of k, and then use the k to solve the maximum deﬁcits problem using the MIP reformulations (11)–(19) in Proposition 1.  This generates a new critical disruption scenario v, which is then added to the master problem (23)–(26) and re-solved for a new value of k.  The solution procedure then repeats, until either no new critical disruption scenario is found, or no feasible k can be found.  However, another issue is that even with a small ¯V, Eqs.  (23)–(26) remain diﬃcult to solve.  This is essentially due to the fact that k, which is involved in the deﬁnition of the set A(v, k), appears in the non-linear product terms kisi in the constraints Eq.  (5).  Hence, to facilitate a more tractable model, we approximate the formulation using a set of discretized variables of ki ∈ [0, 1], for all i = 1,··· , N.  In this way, the product terms kisi becomes a product of a discrete variable ki and a continuous variable si, which can then be reformulated using standard linear mixed integer programming techniques.  The granularity of the discretization of k depends of the choice of the modeler, and of course, the higher the granularity, the larger the computational demands due to the larger number of discrete decision variables required.  Since these involve fairly standard modelling tricks, we do not present the detailed reformulations for sake of conciseness.  A summary of the cutting plane solution procedure is outlined in Algorithm 1.  Algorithm 1.  Cutting plane algorithm for solving problems (23)–4.  Case study Rapid economic growth and industrialization have positioned China as both the largest energy consumer and producer in the world in 2012.  China has built up a comprehensive energy supply system consisting of coal, oil, natural gas, electricity and other renewable resources, which guarantees its long-term and steady economic development.  However, its fast growth in energy consumption has created strains on energy supply system, inevitably exposing more vulnerabilities to energy disruptions caused either by natural hazards (e. g. , ﬂoods, snowstorm, etc. ) or human accidents (e. g. , coal mine explosions, power outages, etc. ).  It is thus of interest, in this case study, to investigate China’s energy-economic resilience to production disruptions in primary energies and power supplies.  We use the 2012 China Input-Output data with 42-sector classiﬁcation (NBS, 2015) to illustrate the application of our proposed energy recovery resilience model.  The detailed names and codes of the Input-Output sectors are shown in Appendix C.  4. 1.  The energy-economic recovery resilience of China.  We ﬁrst solve Models (20)–(22) to evaluate the resilience level q(h, t) for different deﬁcit budget levels t in Table 5 and Fig.  4, and also for different levels of disruption severity h in Table 6.  We consider production disruptions only in energy supply sectors, i. e. , Coal, Oil & Gas, Coke & Petroleum and Electricity, and assume a time horizon of T = 50 weeks, which is reasonable for studying demand-supply imbalance and production recovery in the short term.  Although the numerical results depend on the choice of T, based on our extensive numerical studies, most results are qualitatively consistent (such as ranking of key sectors) when different horizons T are used.  The ﬁrst column in Table 5 gives the different deﬁcit budgets, the second to ﬁfth columns tabulate the optimal values of k for sectors Coal, Oil & Gas, Coke & Petroleum and Electricity respectively, while the last column gives the recovery resilience q(h, t) with disruption severity h = 0. 5.  Obviously, q(h, t) generally increases as the deﬁcits budget increases.  In practice, the deﬁcits budget can be associated with instruments such as reserve capacity buffers, stockpiles or external aids to support ﬁnal demand consumptions during disruptions, which are important measures for improving recovery resilience.  Moreover, we can see from Fig.  4 that the recovery resilience becomes less sensitive to increases in deﬁcit budgets when these budgets are larger.  In other words, the marginal beneﬁt of improving resilience by additional provisions of deﬁcit budgets diminishes with higher levels of deﬁcit budgets.  In Table 6, we can see that for a given level of deﬁcits budget, q(h, t) decreases as disruptions becomes more severe.  This is again consistent and obvious since higher rates of recovery would be required for the economy to limit the extent of the deﬁcits over the same post-disruption horizon.  The zero values of k in the cases of h = 0. 1 and 0. 2 imply that the current deﬁcit budget is larger than the maximum demand deﬁcits across all disruption scenarios, hence no recovery resource is needed.  ‘OB’ denotes that the k values or recovery resources required are out of bounds.  Hence, the resilience value for this situation is zero, which in our deﬁnition is the worst possible.  From the results in Tables 5 and 6, it can be observed that more recovery resources (higher k values) are allocated to the coal mining sector, which suggests that the overall energy-economic recovery depends signiﬁcantly on the coal sector production, which is an extremely important energy sector in China.  In 2012, coal accounts for nearly 66% of China’s primary energy supply, and most of them are for power generation.  Nearly 67% of the total electricity generated in China is from coal-ﬁred plants (NBS, 2013).  Hence, it is not surprising that disruptions in coal production can result in the highest impacts in terms of demand deﬁcits.  According to China’s 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (MIIT, 2013), the Chinese government have promised continued enhancement of coal production capabilities.  For instance, China leads the world in its employment of supercritical and ultra-supercritical advanced coal technologies for production.  They have further enhanced large-scale coal production bases in Shanxi, Inner Mongolia etc.  Also, new coal production centres in the western Xinjiang has been started to supplement production capacity.
