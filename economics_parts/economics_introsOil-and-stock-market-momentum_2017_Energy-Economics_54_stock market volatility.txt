 1.  Introduction Stock market anomalies reﬂect inefﬁciencies in the way information is disseminated in the market place and reﬂected in asset prices via investors' trades.  Anomalies also provide the basis for active investment strategies that aim to generate abnormal proﬁts.  One of the widely examined anomalies that has been shown to persist in stock markets is the momentum anomaly which relates to the relationship between a stock's historical and subsequent performance (e. g.  Asness, 1994.  Carhart, 1997.  Moskowitz and Grinblatt, 1999.  Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993, 2001).  An important implication of this anomaly is an investment strategy called momentum investing that is based on buying past winner stocks and selling past loser stocks.  Thus, apart from being a matter of concern from an academic perspective, the presence of this anomaly has signiﬁcant investment implications as well.  In another popular strand of the literature, numerous studies have explored the effect of oil market dynamics on stock return and volatility.  Oil can affect stock market dynamics via a number of different channels.  At the ﬁrm level, oil price can affect costs and growth expectations, which then affect stock values.  At the consumer level, oil price can affect consumer spending via its effect on their disposable income, thus affect the demand for the products that drive ﬁrm-level revenues and growth rates.  These arguments have in fact been supported in many studies that show a signiﬁcant oil effect on stock returns and volatility. 1 None of these studies, however, have explored whether oil price dynamics also contribute to stock market anomalies that reﬂect informational inefﬁciencies.  From a behavioral perspective, one can argue that oil price ﬂuctuations can affect investor sentiment, which may be particularly signiﬁcant in high oil-sensitive economies.  Such an effect on investor sentiment, in turn, may contribute to mispricing in the stock market in the form of stock market anomalies.  In fact, in a recent study, Ding et al.  (2017) show that oil price ﬂuctuations signiﬁcantly affect investor sentiment in the Chinese stock market without relating their ﬁndings to stock market anomalies.  Therefore, the main contribution of this study is to provide a novel perspective to the oil-stock market nexus by examining the predictive ability of oil price dynamics over a well-studied and yet unresolved stock market anomaly, i. e.  the momentum anomaly, that has been shown to persist in ﬁnancial markets (e. g.  Avramov and Chordia, 2006.  Liu and Zhang, 2008.  Liu et al. , 2011.  Wang and Xu, 2015).  Clearly, this is not only a concern from a market efﬁciency point of view, but can also present considerable abnormal proﬁt opportunities for active managers.  For our empirical study, we focus on China, the second largest oil importer globally (after the U. S. ) with an economy that is heavily reliant on oil imports to sustain its economic growth projections. 2 In addition to China's signiﬁcant role in the world energy markets as a major consumer, several features of the Chinese stock market provide fertile ground to study the oil-stock market nexus from a market anomaly perspective.  First, the literature offers robust evidence of an oil price effect on ﬁnancial markets in China (e. g.  Cong et al. , 2008.  Nguyen and Bhatti, 2012.  Wen et al. , 2012.  Zhu et al. , 2016.  Broadstock et al. , 2016, among others).  Second, Demirer et al.  (2015b) recently show that the momentum anomaly is present in this emerging stock market and document a signiﬁcant herding effect on the short-run performance of momentum strategies.  Finally, recent evidence by Ding et al.  (2017) show that international crude oil price ﬂuctuations signiﬁcantly Granger cause Chinese stock market investor sentiment such that a 1% ﬂuctuation in the price of crude oil leads to a 3. 94% negative effect on stock market sentiment.  Therefore, given the evidence in the literature, the Chinese stock market offers an interesting setup to examine whether oil market dynamics contribute to the momentum anomaly and allows us to extend the literature in a novel direction.  Our ﬁndings show that oil return volatility has robust predictive power over industry momentum payoffs in the Chinese stock market.  The predictive power of oil volatility over momentum is irrespective of whether the market is in a positive or negative state and is robust even after controlling for stock market volatility as well as key macroeconomic variables including the short-term rate, default spread and term spread.  In fact, our robustness checks suggest that oil return volatility absorbs the predictive ability of stock market volatility, implying that uncertainty surrounding oil price movements contributes to this anomaly more so than the stock market's own volatility does.
