 Introduction Shareholders hire a CEO and design the compensation contract to mitigate agency costs and motivate the CEO to make value-increasing decisions.  In addition to the compensation contract, the ﬁrm's debt contract terms and the possibility that the ﬁrm's creditors may wrest control of the ﬁrm also motivate the CEO.  From the perspective of the shareholders, who each year revise the CEO's compensation contract, the incentives provided by long-term debt contracts are pre-existing.  The shareholders potentially adjust the compensation contract such that the compensation incentives, layered on top of the debt contract incentives, modify the CEO's interests to align with those of the ﬁrm's owners.  Whether the pre-existing incentives provided by the debt contract are large enough to affect how compensation contracts are written is an interesting open question.  This study investigates whether the pre-existing debt contract provisions affect the compensation contract struck between the ﬁrm's owners and the CEO.  I document that when the ﬁrm's debt contracts include earnings-based covenants the CEO's cash compensation contract is less sensitive to earnings performance measures.  Prior studies that consider only the performance incentives embedded in the compensation contract potentially underestimate the strength of the CEO's incentives to perform.  Debt contracts are an important class of contracts that provide incentives to the CEO.  Prior literature explores the use of earnings performance measures in debt and compensation contracts, respectively, and documents that contracted performance measures inﬂuence the CEO.  However, the literature is silent on how the use of a performance measure in one contract relates to its use in the other.
