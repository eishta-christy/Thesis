One example which this paper has focused is clean and energy efﬁcient technologies such as the improved cookstoves (ICS).  Improved stoves are stoves that are designed to improve energy efﬁciency, remove smoke from the ☆ We gratefully thank the editor, associate editor and anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions on the preliminary draft of this paper, according to which the content was improved.

Energy efﬁcient technologies are technologies or appliances that reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services.  Despite the health, economic and climate beneﬁt of improved cookstoves, demand for them is surprisingly low in the rural areas of many less-developed countries.
