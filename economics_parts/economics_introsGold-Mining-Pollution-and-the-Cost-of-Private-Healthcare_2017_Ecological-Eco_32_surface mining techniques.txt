Studies have shown that gold extraction and processing can signiﬁcantly degrade natural environments (including soil and sediments,
water, and air quality) and, with that, human health and livelihoods
(Hilson, 2000.  Akpalu and Parks, 2007.  Obiri, 2007.  Leder Name, 2012. 
Saldarriaga-Isaza Name, 2013.  Ako Name, 2014.  Ansa-Asare Name, 2015). 
The pollution mainly occurs during gold extraction and processing,
which includes carbon-in-leach, heap leaching with cyanide, biological
oxidation and roasting (Hilson, 2002.  Leder Name, 2012).  However, the
existing laws in developing countries fail to effectively regulate the
gold mining industries leading to excessive environmental degradation
(Hilson, 2000). 
Thus, in gold-rich countries in Africa, gold miners, both large- and
small-scale, routinely discharge toxic chemicals such as mercury (typically used by small scale miners), cyanide and arsenic and their harmful
compounds into water bodies, exposing workers and residents to a
range of health risks including lower respiratory tract infections, cardiovascular diseases (Franchini and Mannucci, 2007, 2009, and Franchini
and Mannucci, 2012.  Mergler Name, 2007.  Banchirigah, 2008.  Obiri Name, 2010), skin infections, and cancerous infections (Amegbey and
Adimado, 2003.  Adei Name, 2011.  Obiri Name, 2010). 1 A recent review
of arsenic concentration in surface and underground water, for example, found mining as a major cause of high concentration of the hazardous substance in several African countries (Ahoulé Name, 2015).  Some of
the environmental and human damage can be irreversible (see e. g. ,
Naicker Name, 2003.  Stephens and Ahern, 2001). 
In Ghana, for example, several studies have documented heaped
waste materials at mining sites, which have resulted in the release of
toxic chemicals into the environment (see e. g. , Akabzaa Name, 2005. 
Essumang Name, 2007.  Yidana Name, 2007.  and Armah Name, 2010). 
The Council on Ethics of the Norwegian ‘Government Pension Fund
Global’ carried out a detailed survey on mining pollution at the oldest
gold mining town (Obuasi) and found evidence of severe environmental and health damage due to high level of concentration of arsenic, cyanide and heavy metals (e. g.  cadmium, manganese, lead and copper) in
water bodies (Leder Name, 2012).  An earlier study also cited eight cases
of cyanide spillage within a decade and a half (Amegbey and Adimado,
2003), which prompted the Ghana's Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) to remark that the nation is likely to experience water stress in
less than a decade (Banchirigah, 2008). 
In addition to water pollution, the use of heavy machinery in
extracting the ore, coupled with the surface mining techniques
commonly employed by miners in developing countries, generates substantial dust which can cause or exacerbate respiratory disorders
