Oil consumption has risen over the last 50 years, as nations have become reliant on oil for daily activities such as home heating, industrial
processes and transportation (IEA, 2015).  There have historically been
few substitutes for oil, so oil prices and shocks to oil prices have had a
major impact on global economic activity (Brown and Yucel, 2002; He
Name, 2010).  High oil prices in the 1970s had adverse economic impacts
in the industrialized world, and contributed to low growth, high unemployment and high inﬂation (Blanchard and Gali, 2007).  This caused oil
importing nations to re-examine energy security, and resulted in movements towards energy efﬁciency and the development of alternative energy sources (Natural Resources Canada, 2012; Department of Energy and
Climate Change, 2012).  On the other hand, when oil prices drop, oil producing and exporting countries face a reduction in revenue streams
(U. S.  Energy Information Administration, 2016a, 2016b), which can
potentially lead to economic downturns. 
While oil prices were high for much of the early 2000s, prices declined
sharply in the summer of 2014 to levels that were less than half of their
2012 values (US EIA, 2016b).  The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) spot
price for crude oil was $105 per barrel as of July 2014 and by January
2015 it had dropped to 44 $/barrel.  Canada is a major player in the global
market for oil and gas; proven reserves in Canada are third in the world
after Venezuela and Saudia Arabia, while production and exports are
ﬁfth and fourth, respectively.  Further, the oil and gas sector accounted
for 7. 5% of Canadian GDP in 2013 (Natural Resources Canada, 2015). 
Given this dependence on the oil and gas sector, it is clear that shocks to
oil prices may have hard-hitting and potentially long-lasting effects on
the national economy.  With a lower value of Canadian production and exports, Canada suffers a loss of international purchasing power (Royal Bank
of Canada, 2014). 
In Canada, the oil and gas sector is especially predominant within the
provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador
(NL).  In NL, the Oil Extraction and Supporting Activities sector, comprised
primarily of the offshore oil ﬁelds Hibernia, Terra Nova, and White Rose, is
by far the largest individual contributor to GDP, responsible for approximately 30% of provincial GDP.  Provinces such as NL, which saw great beneﬁts from the rise of oil prices prior to the shock in the 2000s, have been
the hardest hit when prices drastically fell.  The shock to oil prices has resulted in increased unemployment, reduced production and GDP: “Production in oil and gas related industries declined by 8% between the
fourth quarters of 2014 and second quarter of 2015, while business
investment linked to these industries fell sharply” (Bank of Canada, 2015). 
In NL, preliminary estimates show that there has been a 2% drop in real
GDP since 2014, an expected decline in production by about 16% as of
2015 and an increase in unemployment by about 0. 6% in 2015
(Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, 2015a, 2015b).  Further,
the oil price drop has reduced government revenue (royalties); the NL
government receives a signiﬁcant portion of its provincial revenue
(33%) from the various royalty regimes associated with the offshore oil
extraction projects (Royal Bank of Canada, 2015). 
Understanding the impact of a major change in oil prices on factors
such as those described above can prove crucial for developing the
optimal policy responses in reaction to shifting prices.
