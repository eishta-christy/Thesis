 1.  Introduction Human societies have always been dependent on material and energy use.  In recent time, however, the increasing level of per-capita consumption and the pressure generated by a rising world population have increased the worldwide energy and material demand.  Based on data provided by Arto et al.  (2012)and by the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2015), the quantity of material extracted increased by around 43% (between 1995 and 2007) and the world energy consumption by almost 100%, rising from 4666 Mtoe in 1973 to 9302 Mtoe in 2013.  Fossil fuels have been the main source of energy supply, accounting today for around 82% of the total energy use (World Bank, 2016).  The consequent impact on resource availability, pollution and unequal distribution of wealth are some of the main elements raising concerns related to possible instabilities and crisis.  Over the last few decades, different models have been proposed to investigate the mutual relationships existing between the humans and the natural environment and the concept of social metabolism has been proposed to investigate the process of energy and material transformation taking place on societies (Martinez-Alier, 1987.  Fischer-Kowalski, 1998).  Based on the idea that the human environment is strictly dependent on the natural environment, the social metabolism analyses the energy and the material use as fundamental elements for the maintenance and development of societies.  The main objective is to investigate how variation in energy, material and human time allocation can generate impact on both social and environmental elements.  The Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) is an accounting framework speciﬁcally design to investigate the size, the allocation and the human and natural dependencies of societies (Giampietro and Mayumi, 1977, 2000).  By using the MuSIASEM approach, this paper compares the metabolic proﬁle of 28 world countries in 1995 and 2007.  The main objective is to provide an overview of the variations that have taken place and to investigate the main elements responsible for changes.  The paper is structured as follow.  Section 2 introduces the methodology.  Section 3 presents the study area and the data sources.  In Section 4 the main results are reported and interpreted.  Section 5 includes discussion, future development and limitations.  Section 6 concludes.  2.  Social Metabolism and MuSIASEM Methodology.  The Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) has been proposed by Giampietro and Mayumi (1977, 2000) based on the integration of various concepts related to complex system theory (Prigogine, 1961, 1978.  Maturana and Valera, 1980.  Odum, 1971, 1983, 1996.  Ulanowicz, 1986, 1995.  Rosen, 1958, 2000.  Zipf, 1941.  Morowitz, 1979.  Kauffman, 1993.  Ahl and Allen, 1996.  Koestler, 1969) post-normal science (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1994) and bioeconomics (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971, 1977) (for exhaustive descriptions please see Mayumi, 1999, Ramos-Martin et al. , 2007 and Giampietro et al. , 2009).  The main idea is to consider societies as metabolic structures that use ﬂows and funds to sustain and expand.  According to the deﬁnition reported by Velasco-Fernandez et al.  (2015), ﬂows are elements that enter into the system, as energy or material and that are transformed by the socio-economic processes.  Funds are elements that are sustained by the ﬂows and that preserve their identity, as for example capital or human time.  The way in which ﬂows and funds are combined characterise the metabolic proﬁle of societies.  The analysis of the relationships existing between energy, materials and socio-economic variables, as human time, demography and economic elements, provides information about the way in which societies evolve and self-organise.  During the last decade, the MuSIASEM approach has proven to be particularly useful to analyse how technological development and acceleration of energy and material use, generates changes in the metabolic structure of societies.  The increasing use of exosomatic energy, deﬁned as the non-human body energy source, has been related to changes in demographic structure, economic activities, human time allocation, social stability and environmental impacts (Mayumi, 1991.  Falconi-Benitez, 2001.
