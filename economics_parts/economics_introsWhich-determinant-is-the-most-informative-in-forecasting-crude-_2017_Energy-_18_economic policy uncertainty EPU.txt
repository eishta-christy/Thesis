 1.  Introduction Explaining the main determinants and improving the forecast accuracy of crude oil market volatility are crucial to market investors and government decision makers.  However, forecasting oil volatility is an intractable task, as the crude oil market is quite complex and has various uncertain determinants, such as global oil supply and demand, OPEC spare capacity levels, ﬁnancial crises, and national elections.  Some studies have claimed that oil price change relies heavily on oil demand and supply, especially global demand (i. e. , Dées et al. , 2007.  Kilian, 2009.  Mu and Ye, 2011).  However, other studies have argued that a speculative component plays a key role (Zhang, 2013.  Hamilton and Wu, 2014.  Kilian and Murphy, 2014.  Juvenal and Petrella, 2015.  Gogolin and Kearney, 2016).  Liu et al.  (2016) disentangle the contributions of oil demand, supply, and speculation in real oil prices, whereas Yin and Zhou (2016) identify the role of speculation and economic fundamentals in driving oil price volatility.  However, as in the seminal work of Baker et al.  (2013) on measuring economic policy uncertainty (EPU), it is worth mentioning that many studies have examined the effect of EPU on the stock market and have considered EPU indices in forecasting stock market returns (Pastor and Veronesi, 2012.
