 1.  Introduction The important role of oil in the world economy has motivated the research on the economic and ﬁnancial consequences caused by oil price changes.  In his seminal study on oil price changes and the macroeconomy, Hamilton (1983) ﬁnds that an oil price shock is a contributing factor to US recession.  Since then, scholars have performed much research on this issue (Jones et al. , 2004.  Hamilton, 2008.  Herrera et al. , 2011.  Filis and Chatziantoniou, 2014.  Salisu et al. , 2017, among others).  Stock markets act as the barometer for anticipating economic changes in economic activity (Fama, 1990).  Oil price is also likely to play an important role in predicting stock prices by at least two channels as follows.  On the one hand, since oil is an important input in the production of many goods, oil price changes may affect future cash ﬂows of enterprises.  As a result, higher oil prices may increase the production cost of enterprises, dampening corporate proﬁts and thus further depressing stock prices (Sadorsky, 1999.
