1. Introduction

Energy supply and production disruptions can have severe conse-
quences in the entire economy. For example, the natural gas supply
disruptions experienced by Argentina in 2004 led to power gener-
ation shortages for the industrial and residential demands, leading
to signiﬁcant impacts the national economy (Honoré, 2004). The
Northeast power outage of 2003 in the U.S. affected more than
55 million people and resulted in estimated $10 billion economic
losses (Liscouski and Elliot, 2004). The topic of energy resilience (e.g.,
FLYNN, 2012) has received much attention in the recent decades in
the study of energy security (e.g., IEA, 2014; Vivoda, 2010; Lefèvre,
2010; Scheepers et al., 2007; Ang et al., 2015). The Presidential Policy
Directive 21 (PPD, 2013) deﬁnes resilience as “the ability to prepare
for and adapt to changing conditions and withstand and recover rapidly
from disruptions; resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover
from deliberate attacks, accidents, or naturally occurring threats or
incidents”. Molyneaux et al. (2012) states that “resilience is the ability
to absorb shocks and still retain function”. Haimes (2009) deﬁned
resilience as the “ability of system to withstand a major disruption
within acceptable degradation parameters and to recover with a suitable
time and reasonable costs and risks”. Hence, the ability of an economy
to recover its essential function of energy supply and production is
of fundamental interest in the study of energy resilience.

Despite various attempts to characterize or deﬁne energy
resilience, its quantiﬁcation is not straightforward. Many aforemen-
tioned efforts proceed by evaluating performance and contributions
from various infrastructural, economic and geographical perspec-
tives, and then aggregating them into a form of composite indicator,
for the purpose of comparison and ranking of energy resilience and
security (e.g., see Vivoda, 2010; Molyneaux et al., 2012; Kruyt et al.,
2009). However, a common critique of such approaches is that there
can be signiﬁcant inﬂuence of subjective judgement, e.g. in deter-
mining the relative importances of aggregating various performance
indicators. More importantly, energy-economic systems are gener-
ally highly inter-connected, and hence many economic sectors can
simultaneously suffer the consequences of energy disruptions (e.g.
in the form of production losses). Furthermore, the sectoral inter-
dependencies can result in an unforeseen cascade of consequences,
due to a seemingly isolated disruption event. In a similar manner,
post-disruption energy-economic recovery is highly dependent on
the inter-sectoral connectivities. Finally, energy resilience can also
depend on the speciﬁc energy sectors disrupted, and often, there is
limited a priori information or data to suggest which energy sectors
are the most vulnerable targets of attack.
Motivated by the above issues, in this paper we propose an
Input-Output linear programming model to study the relationships
between energy production disruptions, impacts on sectoral pro-
duction and demands, and post-disruption recovery efforts. Despite
some of their limitations, Input-Output models continue to be
widely-adopted and useful formats to depict inter-sectoral depen-
dencies in the economy and energy emission studies (Su and Ang,
2012; Su and Ang, 2015; Hoekstra, 2010; Hawkins et al., 2015).
Many countries and states have continued to collect, publish and
update data for calibrating Input-Output tables (e.g., 43 countries’
time series IO data in World Input-Output Database Timmer et al.,
2016). Our proposed methodology uses the economic Input-Output
structure, in the format of a linear programming model, to evalu-
ate the impact of a given energy sector’s output disruption on all
other sectors’ total outputs and ability to fulﬁl ﬁnal goods demands.
Since energy production disruptions can arise from different sec-
tors (possibly simultaneously) and cannot be anticipated precisely
in advance, our proposed model evaluates the maximum impact on
the economy, in the form of ﬁnal demand deﬁcits, over a set of
(possibly inﬁnite) production disruption scenarios. Our model also
includes production recovery assumptions, so that after the energy
disruption event, production is allowed to gradually recover, the rate
of which depends on the level of recovery investments assumed.
Finally, the above components are combined to deﬁne the energy-
economic resilience of the system under study, which is essentially
related to the minimum level of extrinsic resource recovery invest-
ments required to restore the production levels suﬃciently, such
that the total economic impacts do not exceed a stipulated level
over a stipulated post-disruption duration. This provides decision-
makers with a simple way to evaluate, compare and rank the energy
resilience of a given (set of) Input-Output system(s) under various
scenario assumptions. Moreover, our methodology can be used to
identify the most vulnerable sectors at different levels of disruptions.
The main contributions of this work are as follows. (a) A nov-
elty in our proposed approach is the use of the level of required
recovery efforts as a measure of energy resilience such that it only
requires speciﬁcations such as the impact level of disruption, the
level of acceptable demand deﬁcits and the post-disruption duration
which are much more concrete and easier to elicit from stakeholders.
Besides, by using minimum required recovery efforts as the surro-
gate for the energy resilience, our methodology bypasses several
diﬃculties in modelling energy resilience since in reality, data relat-
ing restoration investments to production recovery speeds are dif-
ﬁcult to obtain and calibrate. (b) Our model correctly captures the
physical realities of supply and demand balances during a disruption
and can evaluate the maximum impact arising from an arbitrarily
large set of disruption scenarios without applying single-scenario-
a-time analysis nor relying on Monte Carlo methods compared to
other works in recovery modelling. (c) We show that our proposed
model can be reformulated and solved as a sequence of mixed inte-
ger programming models, which can be eﬃciently accomplished by
commercial solvers such as CPLEX. This is computationally attrac-
tive compared to more complex but highly non-linear models (see
e.g. Reed et al., 2009; Vugrin and Camphouse, 2011). (d) We show
that the critical energy disruptions can depend on both the inter-
sectoral dependencies and the scale of the disruption. This implies
that anticipating and predicting critical sectors (e.g. for fortiﬁcation
purposes) generally cannot be accomplished by simply inspecting
and analyzing the Input-Output data. Besides, resorting to brute force
scenario enumeration can become practically infeasible for large
systems. These considerations collectively provide justiﬁcation why
automated decision analytics provided by our methodology play an
important role in energy resilience studies.

The outline of the paper is as follows. The next section reviews
the literature of related works in the application of Input-Output
models and their extensions for energy studies, and also the use
of linear programming models in Input-Output analysis. Section 3
introduces our proposed basic model to compute ﬁnal demand
deﬁcits incurred after disruption, the uncertainty model for deﬁning
the production disruption scenarios, the model to evaluate the max-
imum demand deﬁcit, and the proposed energy-economic recovery
resilience. Moreover, to evaluate the maximum impact of the eco-
nomic system from the uncertain set of production disruption sce-
narios, we propose an equivalent formulation of the model in the
format of a mixed integer linear programming model. In Section 4, a
case study using China 2012 Input-Output data is used to illustrate
our methodology in further details. Finally, Section 5 presents the
concluding remarks and suggestions for the future research.

2. Literature review.
In the past three decades, the Leontief
Input-Output model
(Leontief, 1986) has been widely used to study energy and eco-
nomical issues (see the articles, Su and Ang, 2012; Hoekstra, 2010;
Hawkins et al., 2015). Moreover, combining linear programming
with Input-Output modelling is a popular approach to study various
energy-economy-environment problems in the research literature.
For instance, Wang and Miller (1995) proposed an Input-Output lin-
ear programming model to analyze the economic impact of a trans-
portation and energy supply bottleneck on the economy of Taiwan.
Leung and Hsu (1984) proposed the use of an linear programming
model to study the economic impacts of energy supply reductions on
the Hawaiian economy; Rose et al. (1997) used an Input-Output lin-
ear program to study the regional economic impact of an earthquake
and they found a disruption in electricity was caused by realloca-
tion of the scarce electricity across sectors could reduce the impacts
substantially.

Input-Output analysis is also frequently used to assess the econ-
omy recovery following disasters. Hallegatte (2008) applied Input-
Output analysis to the landfall of Katrina in Louisiana by taking into
account changes in production capacity due to productive losses and
adaptive behaviour in the aftermath of a disaster. Li et al. (2013)
developed a theoretical route map for imbalanced economic recov-
ery called dynamic inequalities based on Input-Output model and
applied it to a hypothetical post-disaster economic scenario of ﬂood-
ing in London to assess the inﬂuence of shocks to a regional economy.
Separately, Haimes and Jiang (2001) and Santos and Haimes (2004)
used an extension of Leontief Input-Output (i.e., inoperability Input-
Output and dynamic inoperability Input-Output) to quantify the
economic losses triggered by terrorism and other disruptive events
to economic systems (or industry sectors) where the economic
Input-Output data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis was
incorporated into the model for economic impact analysis. The vari-
ous applications of inoperability Input-Output models can be found
in Crowther and Haimes (2005), Crowther et al. (2007), Anderson
et al. (2007), and Barker and Haimes (2009). The main strength of
the Input-Output approach is in that it enables the analyst to dif-
ferentiate and quantify impacts in different sectors, through diverse
channels of causality, and across regions, though the data required
to accomplish that fully are quite extensive (Okuyama and Santos,
2014).

There are also some published works proposing Input-Output lin-
ear programming models to study the recovery of interconnected
system due to disruptions. For instance, Tan (2011) developed an
optimization model with inoperability constraints to determine the
optimal allocation of various energy sources within a system to
corresponding energy sinks or demands, while ensuring that inop-
erability limits of the latter are satisﬁed for multiple enumerated
scenarios. MacKenzie et al. (2014) proposed static and dynamic mod-
els to determine the optimal resource allocation to facilitate the
recovery of impacted industries after a disruption where the objec-
tive is to minimize the production losses due to the disruption.
equilibrium, the output from each sector i should match the inter-
mediate demands from all other sectors j for goods i (including itself)
and ﬁnal demands fi.

Suppose a production disruption level of 4i has taken place in sec-
tor i at a certain point in time (e.g. t = 0), so that the production level
falls to ˆxi − 4i. Production disruptions in this paper are assumed to be
consequences of disruptions in the production capacity of the sector
(e.g. due to attacks on the critical production infrastructures), so that
the sector is inhibited from producing at levels greater than ˆxi − 4i. A
supply-demand gap will then appear and the balance in Eq. (2) can-
not be achieved with the equilibrium levels of production outputs ˆx
and ﬁnal demands f. Without any further intervention, the impact
on the economy post-disruption is a reduction in all other produc-
tion outputs due to the inter-sectoral Input-Output dependencies,
and consequently compromising the fulﬁlment of the ﬁnal demands.
A new equilibrium is then reached when the ﬁnal demand levels are
reduced suﬃciently. The ﬁnal demands that has been compromised
from its original levels in this manner is termed as demand deﬁcits in
this work. Next, we assume that after the disruption event, recovery
efforts are initiated to restore the production of the disrupted sector
to its original equilibrium level. In reality, the length of the recovery
process depends on the effectiveness of the restoration efforts. As the
disrupted sector gradually recovers, the production levels of all other
sectors are also restored to their original equilibrium levels.

Based on the above context, we introduce the following Input-
Output linear programming model to describe the recovery of the
production levels that minimizes the total demand deﬁcits over a
horizon of T time periods after the disruption event.

Baghersad and Zobel (2015) used Input-Output linear programming
to investigate the economic consequences of production capacity
bottlenecks caused by disasters. They also consider recovery oper-
ations within disrupted sectors, from the standpoint of evaluating
the performance of the economy during the transition period after a
disaster.

While the above works focus on combining Input-Output models
with linear programming techniques to analyze the impact of energy
supply shortage (e.g., oil and electricity disruption) on national
economy, they did not consider the issues of the uncertain nature of
disruption events. In this work, our models explicitly address the dis-
ruption uncertainties and incorporate the mechanisms to evaluate
energy-economic resilience. In our opinion, issues of energy supply
disruption and energy resilience under uncertainty are of greater
interest from the energy security aspect, and worthy of a more rig-
orous and technical approach of study. This paper is more than an
extension of the work by He on energy imports resilience
evaluation using an Input-Output with linear programming model;
it is a generalization of He as we now explicitly consider
the post-disruption recovery of output and use the recovery effort
concept to motivate and deﬁne our notion of resilience here, which
is much more complicated and broader in scope than the previous
work.

<Middle> Methodology.
In this section, we present the models used to characterize
the inter-sectoral dependencies, energy production disruptions and
post-disruption recovery. These are then combined to deﬁne our
proposed energy-economic resilience evaluation model. The key
notations in this paper are shown in Table 1. Other notation will be
deﬁned as when appropriate and necessary.
3.1.1. Model description.
The basic Leontief Input-Output model depicts the inter-sectoral
relationship between goods producing sectors in an economy
through the supply-demand balance equation where ˆx is the N × 1 vector of sectors’ outputs in an economy of n
sectors, A = [aij] is the Leontief technical coeﬃcient matrix, and f is
the N-vector of ﬁnal demands. Eqs. (1) and (2) basically state that in here.

In the above model, the objective function (3) minimizes the total
ﬁnal demand deﬁcits si,t over all sectors and time periods up to T.
Constraint (4) is an extension of the Leontief Input-Output Eq. (1),
speciﬁed for each time period t, and says that the production of sector
i in period t should match the corresponding intermediate demands
from all sectors, plus the compromised ﬁnal demands fi − si,t. Con-
straint (5) depicts the production capacity recovery model, where
the variable ri,t is deﬁned as the total recovered production capac-
ity up to t in sector i. Hence, in each period t, the recovered capacity
increases by a component proportional to the demand deﬁcit level
si,t, which can also be regarded as the supply-demand gap in the
Input-Output equation in Constraint (4). The non-negative recovery
rate coeﬃcient ki determines the speed of recovery of the sector, and
is deﬁned as the production capacity recovered per unit deﬁcit per
unit time. Clearly, the larger the value of ki, the faster the capacity
recovery. Also, when the demand-supply gap in sector i is eliminated,
si,t = 0, no further capacity recovery takes place. We further discuss
on Constraint (5) later in this section. Constraint (6) states that, the
sector i(cid:5)s output at time t is not greater than the production capacity
available (immediately after disruption plus that recovered). Deﬁn-
ing ri,0 = 0, it means that immediately after the disruption at t = 0,
the remaining production capacity sector in i is ˆxi − 4i
ˆxi. Constraint
(7) states that the demand deﬁcits are bounded above by the ﬁnal
demand levels f, or equivalently, that all compromised ﬁnal demands
fi − si,t are non-negative. Note that if sit = fi for all i, for some t, then
all production in the economy seizes, i.e. x = 0. Finally, Constraint
(8) are non-negativity constraints for the decision variables.

We next give some further explanation and justiﬁcation for the
capacity recovery model in the above formulation. In particular, it is
easy to see that Constraint (5) describes a ﬁrst-order difference sys-
tem (e.g., see Salamon, 1996) for modelling the production capacity
recovery dynamics, which in general is an approximation to real-
world recovery dynamics. Although it is rather simple in structure,
the linear difference system still provides many interesting insights
and has been applied in many areas to model the recovery processes.
For instance, Davidson and Çagnan (2004) validated that the post-
earthquake recovery of lifeline systems such as electricity and water
supply follows a ﬁrst-order exponential trajectory. Priest et al. (1996)
used a ﬁrst-order linear system to model the recovery from medi-
cal conditions. We also note that some works proposed the dynamic
Leontief input output based models (including so called inoperabil-
ity models) to model the output recovery from a supply disruption
(Lian and Haimes, 2006). However, those models in our opinion do
not respect the physical reality of interest here. For instance, if there
is a disruption in sector i(cid:5)s output, then other sectors requiring goods
from sector i could suffer from a loss of inputs and consequently they
cannot support their original levels of production outputs. Such real-
ities however do not seem to hold in general for the models proposed
in the aforementioned work.

Our proposed Models (3)– (8) can be easily extended to account
for many different issues with the modiﬁcations of the constraints or
objective function. For example, considerations such as buffer pro-
duction capacity can be included as a decision variable in Constraint
(6), and does not change the concept of the approach. It can also be
extended to include production stockpiles such as strategic reserves
explicitly in Constraint (4), which is also an important instrument
in mitigating energy disruptions. In this work, we focus on the
basic models (3)–(8) for the purpose of presenting our methodology
clearly.

3.1.2. A simple three-sector example.
To reinforce the ideas of the proposed Models (3)–(8), in the
following we use a three-sector example for illustration. The three
sectors are: Manufacturing (i = 1), Energy e.g., oil, gas, coke, petroleum
(i = 2), and Electricity (i = 3). The Input-Output table is shown in
Table 2 and the corresponding technical coeﬃcient matrix A = [aij]
is.
The output recovery path (xi,t) and ﬁnal demand deﬁcit (si,t) for
disruption in Manufacturing, Energy and Electricity sector in turn,
are plotted in the Figs. 1, 2 and 3 respectively, assuming a T = 50-
week horizon and ki = 0.2. The disruption level 4i is assumed to
be 10% for each sector. From Fig. 1, after the disruption in Manu-
facturing sector, all three sectors’ production recover gradually and
approach their original levels, and demand deﬁcits only appear in
the disrupted Manufacturing sector and decreases as the production
recovers. For Electricity and Energy sectors, their demand deﬁcits are
zero since their production levels, although decreased as a conse-
quence of their inputs from Manufacturing being disrupted, are still
suﬃcient to balance intermediate consumptions and ﬁnal demands.
The total demand deﬁcits is 72,928 (millions CNY) in this scenario.

In contrast, from Fig. 2, when the disruption occurs in the Energy
sector, demand deﬁcits appear in both Energy and Electricity sectors.
The obvious reason is that since Electricity sector is heavily reliant
on inputs such as coal, oil and gas from the Energy sector, the lat-
ter’s disruption impacts electricity production so severely that ﬁnal
demands for electricity cannot be met. Finally, when the same level
of disruption happens in Electricity sector, demand deﬁcits appear
in all the three sectors. This is a consequence of the fact that both
the other two sectors are heavily reliant on Electricity sector for
their inputs. The total demand deﬁcits is 3086 (millions CNY) in this
scenario.

3.2. A model for evaluating maximum disruption impacts.
3.2.1. Model description.
From the aforementioned example, it can be seen that the con-
sequence and impact of the disruption can be sensitive to the dis-
ruption scenario considered (i.e. which sector(s) is (are) disrupted).
In the example, the disruption, when taking place in the Manufactur-
ing sector, resulted in the largest level of demand deﬁcits, which was
also entirely concentrated in the demand of Manufacturing goods.
When disruptions occurred in the other sectors, the total deﬁcits
were lower, but more sectors’ ﬁnal demands were compromised. In
this section, we will evaluate the maximum impact of disruptions
across many different possible disruption scenarios. In this work we
use the total demand deﬁcits incurred to deﬁne the impact of the
disruption.

In reality, production disruptions can take place in any sector
or many sectors simultaneously. The disruptions can be deliberate
(e.g., terrorist attacks) or non-deliberate (e.g., careless accidents, nat-
ural catastrophes). Production disruptions generally can also have
very little historical bearing. In particular, it can be diﬃcult to ascer-
tain the occurrence likelihood of a disruption scenario. With these
considerations, we deﬁne the following set of possible disruption
scenarios parameterized by the severity parameter h.
In the above, 4i refers to the level of disruption of sector i, expressed
as a proportion of the original equilibrium levels ˆxi, and thus 4i
ˆxi is
the actual disruption level. Y(h) describes the set of all disruption
scenarios 4 such that the total number of sectors disrupted in the
economy is no more than hN. The parameter h can thus be used to
deﬁne different sets of disruption scenarios corresponding to differ-
ent severity levels of the disruption. For instance, when h = 0, Y(h)
reduces trivially to a singleton, i.e. Y(h = 0) ={ 0}, which means
simply that there are no disruptions, while Y(h = 1) corresponds
to the largest set of scenarios where all the N sectors can be fully
disrupted.

Using the above the production disruption scenario set Y(h), we
can now evaluate the maximum demand deﬁcit using the following
optimization model.
where M is a suﬃciently large positive constant.

As can be seen, the above formulation we considered is a general

case where hN can be non-integer.

Hence, the optimal solution in the above outer maximization
∗, can be regarded as the ‘most critical’ disruption
problem, say 4
scenario, since it results in the highest impact (i.e. maximum demand
deﬁcits). We now consider the approach of solving Model (10). First,
note that if the number of disruption scenarios 4 is small, the max-
min problem can be solved by simply ﬁxing 4 and then solving the
inner linear programming model in turn. The maximum demand
deﬁcits is then determined by inspecting the largest deﬁcits across all
the scenarios. The above model, however, describes the maximiza-
tion over an inﬁnite set of 4 arising from the polyhedral set Y(h). A
possible ad-hoc approach can then be to randomly sample scenar-
ios from Y(h), evaluate them, and then obtain the maximum demand
deﬁcits. Such an approach however, unavoidably contains sampling
errors and poses the danger of missing out very critical scenarios,
unless an extremely large number of scenarios are considered. The
max-min problem in Eq. (10) is a speciﬁc instance of a two-stage
adaptable robust linear optimization problem, which is computa-
tionally intractable in general (see e.g. Ben-Tal et al., 2009). Based on
the speciﬁcation of the Y(h) in Eq. (9) we are able to show that the
max-min problem in Eq. (10) can be converted into a single instance
of a linear mixed integer programming problem, which can then be
handled quite eﬃciently using powerful commercial solvers such as
CPLEX. This reformulation is presented in the following proposition.

Proposition 1. Solving problem Eq. (10) is equivalent to solving the
following mixed integer program Eqs. (11)–(19).
By applying Proposition 1, the original problem can be reformu-
lated to a solvable linear mixed integer program with which we are
able to deﬁne the energy recovery resilience in the next subsection.
The practical implication of this result is that the evaluation of the
max-min model can now be performed exactly, and need not rely
on sampling approaches, which unavoidably introduces sampling
errors.

3.2.2. Three-sector example: evaluating critical disruptions and
maximum deﬁcits.
We continue to use the three-sector example in Section 3.1.2 to
illustrate the application of the maximum demand deﬁcits model
(10). Assume ki = 0.2 for each sector i, andT = 50. The results
under different disruption severity levels h • N are shown in Table 3.
As can be seen, the maximum demand deﬁcits generally increase as
h increases. The columns 4
Elec depict the critical disruption scenario. It can be observed that, when h • N is not greater than
0.3, disruption in Manufacturing sector causes the largest impact, and
only ﬁnal manufacturing demands are compromised. When the total
disruption level is greater than 0.4, disruption in Electricity sector is
the most impactful, and all demand deﬁcits appear across all three
sectors. This suggests that identifying the critical disruption scenario
is not always straightforward; indeed the critical disruption scenario
not only depends on the Input-Output relationship of the sectors, but
can also depend on the severity of the disruption considered. This is
an important information for policy-makers interested in identifying
critical sectors to fortify.

Generally, it may not be immediately obvious what causes the
‘switching’ of the critical disruption sectors. Such characteristic how-
ever can be explained using linear programming concepts based on
the model (10), the details of which is available in the Appendix
section for the interested readers.

Clearly, larger values of recovery rate coeﬃcients k can result in
faster production recoveries and smaller demand deﬁcits. Table 4
illustrates some of these results by varying the level of k. However,
larger values of k imply greater levels of extrinsic support for
recovery, and can be prohibitively expensive in practice. These issues
are further discussed in the next section.
3.3. Energy-economic recovery resilience.
In models (3)–(8), post-disruption recovery of the economic sys-
tem is enabled through the ﬁrst-order production capacity restora-
tion function in Eq. (5), and clearly, how fast the economy regains
its initial equilibrium depends on the assumed values of the recov-
ery rate parameters k, where larger values of k implies that a higher
proportion of the existing demand-supply gap can be closed over the
same duration. A practical challenge in using models (3)–(8) (and by
extension the maximum demand deﬁcits model (10)) directly is on
the estimation and choice of the values of k used. This can be done,
for example, if one has the luxury of the data regarding the pro-
duction restoration efforts from past disruption incidents. Generally,
larger values of k suggest higher levels of resource investments for
developing the restoration capability. For instance, more recovery
crews, higher availability of repair equipment and capabilities will
be needed for rapid restoration of transmission lines or power gen-
erators following an electricity supply disruption. In practice, many
such recovery resources need to be developed or acquired before dis-
ruptions occur. An important question that one may then pose is,
can two economies with similar recovery rate parameters k, but dif-
ferent inter-sectoral dependencies (i.e. the Input-Output matrix A),
have different post disruption economic recovery performance?

Based on the above considerations, in this section we propose an
extension of Model (10), to evaluate the energy recovery resilience of
the economy. This proposed model assumes a speciﬁed deﬁcit bud-
get t, which is deﬁned as the maximum permissible total demand
deﬁcits incurred over the post-disruption horizon of T time periods.
The model is deﬁned as follows.

The optimal objective function value V(h, t) in Eq. (20) is the
minimum total level of k required by the economy to ensure that
total demand deﬁcits are not greater than t, over T time periods
post disruption, where the disruption is any scenario from Y(h).
Hence, V(h, t) can be viewed as a surrogate of a least cost investment
in production recovery capability while meeting demand deﬁcits
requirements. We also deﬁne the energy-economic recovery resilience
as this.
Given a value of k, the left hand side of Eq. (21) computes the max-
imum deﬁcits level, that is, the model (10). In Eq. (22) we assume
that k is bounded above by 1 (i.e. capacity recovery is at 100% of the
demand-supply gap), although generally any other upper bounds can
be used.

In summary, Models (20)–(22) can be used to rank different
economic structures (speciﬁcally, corresponding to different Leon-
tief matrice A) in their recovery resilience. For example, one may
consider a scenario analysis of switching power generation from
coal-ﬁring to nuclear-ﬁring technology in a given economy. This will
result in a change of the generation mix and essentially some of the
entries of A. Models (20)–(22) is then solved for the corresponding
q values prior and after the technology change. Larger values of q
implies a more resilient system, since it requires lower exogenous
investments k to achieve the same demand deﬁcits requirements.
Furthermore, we highlight that a practical advantage of models (20)–
(22) is that we do not need to calibrate or estimate the k in advance,
which can be extremely diﬃcult due to lack of data. Instead, the
model chooses for us the optimal values. As a trade-off, we need
to specify t in the model. However, t in our opinion is much eas-
ier to solicit from the model users. If that is also not possible,
still, performing scenario analysis with different values of t is quite
straightforward (compared to that using k).

3.4. Solving the energy-economic recovery model.
We now consider the solution approach of the models (20)–(22).
Deﬁne V as the set of all vertices v in the set Y(h), and A(4, k) as the
polyhedral set.

Deﬁning ¯V ⊆ V, we term the following as the master problem.
When ¯V = V, master problem (23)–(26) indeed is equivalent
to the energy recovery resilience models (20)–(22). These are stated
in the following technical results, the proofs of which are found in
Appendix A.2 and A.3.

Proposition 2. Consider the maximum demand deﬁcits model (10).
There exist some extreme point v ∈ V , so that4 = v is an optimal
solution (i.e. the critical disruption scenario) in Eq. (10).

Proposition 3. The formulations (23)–(26), with
lent to the energy recovery resilience models (20)–(22).
Formulations (23)–(26) is the basis of implementing an itera-
tive cutting plane solution approach, where instead of having ¯V =
V, which generally consists of an exponentially large number of
constraints (due to the large size of the vertex set V), we solve
Eqs. (23)–(26) using a small subset ¯V, solve for a value of k, and then
use the k to solve the maximum deﬁcits problem using the MIP refor-
mulations (11)–(19) in Proposition 1. This generates a new critical
disruption scenario v, which is then added to the master problem
(23)–(26) and re-solved for a new value of k. The solution proce-
dure then repeats, until either no new critical disruption scenario is
found, or no feasible k can be found. However, another issue is that
even with a small ¯V, Eqs. (23)–(26) remain diﬃcult to solve. This is
essentially due to the fact that k, which is involved in the deﬁnition
of the set A(v, k), appears in the non-linear product terms kisi in the
constraints Eq. (5). Hence, to facilitate a more tractable model, we
approximate the formulation using a set of discretized variables of
ki ∈ [0, 1], for all i = 1,··· , N. In this way, the product terms kisi
becomes a product of a discrete variable ki and a continuous variable
si, which can then be reformulated using standard linear mixed inte-
ger programming techniques. The granularity of the discretization of
k depends of the choice of the modeler, and of course, the higher the
granularity, the larger the computational demands due to the larger
number of discrete decision variables required. Since these involve
fairly standard modelling tricks, we do not present the detailed re-
formulations for sake of conciseness. A summary of the cutting plane
solution procedure is outlined in Algorithm 1.

4. Case study

Rapid economic growth and industrialization have positioned
China as both the largest energy consumer and producer in the world
in 2012. China has built up a comprehensive energy supply system
consisting of coal, oil, natural gas, electricity and other renewable
resources, which guarantees its long-term and steady economic
development. However, its fast growth in energy consumption has
created strains on energy supply system, inevitably exposing more
vulnerabilities to energy disruptions caused either by natural haz-
ards (e.g., ﬂoods, snowstorm, etc.) or human accidents (e.g., coal mine
explosions, power outages, etc.). It is thus of interest, in this case
study, to investigate China’s energy-economic resilience to produc-
tion disruptions in primary energies and power supplies. We use
the 2012 China Input-Output data with 42-sector classiﬁcation (NBS,
2015) to illustrate the application of our proposed energy recovery
resilience model. The detailed names and codes of the Input-Output
sectors are shown in Appendix C.


4.1. The energy-economic recovery resilience of China.
We ﬁrst solve Models (20)–(22) to evaluate the resilience level
q(h, t) for different deﬁcit budget levels t in Table 5 and Fig. 4, and
also for different levels of disruption severity h in Table 6. We con-
sider production disruptions only in energy supply sectors, i.e., Coal,
Oil & Gas, Coke & Petroleum and Electricity, and assume a time horizon
of T = 50 weeks, which is reasonable for studying demand-supply
imbalance and production recovery in the short term. Although the
numerical results depend on the choice of T, based on our extensive
numerical studies, most results are qualitatively consistent (such
as ranking of key sectors) when different horizons T are used. The
ﬁrst column in Table 5 gives the different deﬁcit budgets, the sec-
ond to ﬁfth columns tabulate the optimal values of k for sectors
Coal, Oil & Gas, Coke & Petroleum and Electricity respectively, while
the last column gives the recovery resilience q(h, t) with disrup-
tion severity h = 0.5. Obviously, q(h, t) generally increases as
the deﬁcits budget increases. In practice, the deﬁcits budget can
be associated with instruments such as reserve capacity buffers,
stockpiles or external aids to support ﬁnal demand consumptions
during disruptions, which are important measures for improving
recovery resilience. Moreover, we can see from Fig. 4 that the recov-
ery resilience becomes less sensitive to increases in deﬁcit budgets
when these budgets are larger. In other words, the marginal bene-
ﬁt of improving resilience by additional provisions of deﬁcit budgets
diminishes with higher levels of deﬁcit budgets. In Table 6, we can
see that for a given level of deﬁcits budget, q(h, t) decreases as dis-
ruptions becomes more severe. This is again consistent and obvious
since higher rates of recovery would be required for the economy to
limit the extent of the deﬁcits over the same post-disruption horizon.
The zero values of k in the cases of h = 0.1 and 0.2 imply that the
current deﬁcit budget is larger than the maximum demand deﬁcits
across all disruption scenarios, hence no recovery resource is needed.
‘OB’ denotes that the k values or recovery resources required are out
of bounds. Hence, the resilience value for this situation is zero, which
in our deﬁnition is the worst possible.

From the results in Tables 5 and 6, it can be observed that more
recovery resources (higher k values) are allocated to the coal min-
ing sector, which suggests that the overall energy-economic recovery
depends signiﬁcantly on the coal sector production, which is an
extremely important energy sector in China. In 2012, coal accounts
for nearly 66% of China’s primary energy supply, and most of them
are for power generation. Nearly 67% of the total electricity gen-
erated in China is from coal-ﬁred plants (NBS, 2013). Hence, it is
not surprising that disruptions in coal production can result in the
highest impacts in terms of demand deﬁcits. According to China’s
12th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (MIIT, 2013), the Chinese government have
promised continued enhancement of coal production capabilities.
For instance, China leads the world in its employment of supercritical
and ultra-supercritical advanced coal technologies for production.
They have further enhanced large-scale coal production bases in
Shanxi, Inner Mongolia etc. Also, new coal production centres in
the western Xinjiang has been started to supplement production
capacity. At the same time, China is also decommissioning several
ineﬃcient coal-ﬁred plants to curb national GHG emissions and other
environmental impacts. In the 12th FYP, China has set targets of
reducing 17% of carbon-intensity and 16% of energy intensity (GOSC,
2013), which may put pressure on China’s coal production and con-
sequently its energy security status. The following approaches to
mitigate carbon intensity as well as enhance energy security in tan-
dem are also proposed: (1) To improve coal cleaning technology
which will not only help reduce the GHG emissions but also help
improve the eﬃciency of coal production; (2) To develop higher
eﬃcient, environmentally-friendly coal-ﬁred power generation tech-
nology such as ultra supercritical power generation technology,
integrated gasiﬁcation combined cycle (IGCC).

Based on the obtained recovery resilience situation and optimal
recovery rate parameters k, we next identify the critical disruption
scenarios, through the maximum demand deﬁcits model (10). The
results are shown in Table 7 for different severity levels. The ﬁrst
column indicates the disruption severity levels hN considered, the
second to ﬁfth columns are obtained critical disruption scenarios 4
corresponding to energy sectors Coal, Oil & Gas, Coke & Petroleum and
Electricity respectively. Finally, the last column tabulates the total
demand deﬁcits incurred, which generally increases as h increases.
First, note that in each critical disruption scenario, although the
disruption is concentrated in one sector, the optimal allocation of
recovery resources k (in Tables 5 and 6) is diversiﬁed across all four
energy sectors, since the actual disrupted sectors are not known
in advance to the decision-maker allocating the recovery resources.
Next, it can be observed that when the severity of the disruption is
smaller than h = 0.06, Electricity sector is identiﬁed to be the most
vulnerable sector. When severity increases beyond h = 0.06 to 0.7,
Coal is the most vulnerable; while for h = 0.8 to 1, the critical sector
switches to Oil& Gas. These results indicate, as also illustrated in the
earlier three-sector toy example, that the critical disruption scenario,
and consequently the vulnerability of each sector, depends not only
on the inter-sectoral connectivities, but also on the severity level,
i.e. the scale of the disruption. This shows that identifying the criti-
cal sectors is not always a straightforward and obvious affair. In this
regard, our proposed model provides an important decision support
for the users.

4.2. The scenario of electricity disruption.
As can be seen from the previous results, the Electricity sector is
the most vulnerable sector when the disruption severity level h • N is
from 0.01 to 0.05. China is the world’s largest electricity consumer,
surpassing the US in 2011 owing to her rapid industrial growth since
the early 1990s. As previously stated, most power generation relies
on coal-ﬁring, which accounts for about 66% of the Chinese genera-
tion portfolio in 2012. China is trying to reduce this by seeking for
alternative and cleaner power. On the other hand, in the recent years,
there has been an increase in power outage cases in China caused
either by natural disasters or man-made accidents, for example, the
2008 blackout due to snow storm is among the 10 largest blackouts
in the world. Many such outages have resulted in tremendous eco-
nomic losses. Hence, the objective of this section is to investigate the
impact of disruptions in electricity sector in the rest of the economy.
To evaluate the impact of power outages in the economy, for a
given severity h in the Electricity sector, we solve Models (3)–(8) to
evaluate the resulting demand deﬁcits. In this case we assume that
the recovery rate parameters k take on the optimal values obtained
in the previous Section 4.1. To eliminate the effect of sector size, we
deﬁne the Average Deﬁcit Ratio as the ratio of total demand deﬁcits
divided by total recovery time T to the original ﬁnal demand level,
tsi,t
. The results of the top ten sectors in Average Deﬁcit Ratio, are
T • fi
presented in Table 8, for three different levels of electricity dis-
ruption severities, h = 0.1, 0.5, and0.8. First, it can be seen that
these sets of sectors are mostly consistent across the different sever-
ity levels. Asides the Electricity sector itself (S36), the rest of these
impacted sectors are among the most electricity-intensive sectors in
the economy. For example, Mining and processing of ferrous metal ores
sector (S04), Mining and processing of ferrous/non-ferrous metal ores
sectors (S05), Smelting and pressing non-ferrous metals sector (S27),
and Production and supply of water sector (S38), account for 26%
of the total electricity consumption in China in 2012 (NBS, 2013).
The results in Table 8 can thus provide targeted guidelines with
regards to planning of reserve capacities and stockpiles to mitigate
the consequences of electricity disruptions.

We plot the recovery paths of some key sectors (Electricity,
Coal, Water, Ferrous Metal Mining) for different electricity disruption
severity levels (h = 0.1 and 0.5) in Figs. 5 and 6 respectively. As

can be seen in Fig. 5, after the disruption, all the production outputs
fall, due to the sectoral-interdependencies. Recovery actions then
kick in to increase the Electricity sector outputs, and these recovered
outputs are allocated to the rest of the sectors (via the optimal solu-
tions of Models (3)–(8)), as intermediate inputs to help recover their
own production levels and to minimize total demand deﬁcits. Since
the severity of the disruption is relatively small (h = 0.1), demand
deﬁcits only occurred in the ﬁnal consumptions in Electricity sector.
In contrast, for Fig. 6, when the disruption severity is much higher,
i.e. h = 0.5, it can be observed that deﬁcits take place in both Water
and Ferrous Metal Ores Mining sectors, in addition to the Electricity
sector. In fact, the deﬁcits in these sectors did not start to close until
after thirty time periods. A possibility of this is because in the Models
(3)–(8), the optimal Input-Output balance of the economy dictates
that the recovered production of electricity be ﬁrst used to ﬁll inter-
mediate productions and ﬁnal consumptions of possibly other more
critical sectors ﬁrst. When those sectors requirements are suﬃciently
met, the recovered electricity output is the used to ﬁll the deﬁcits in
Electricity, Water and Ferrous Metal Ores Mining sectors.

In the 12th FYP, the Chinese government have formulated several
polices and goals for energy-intensive industries. This includes, for
instance, that the energy consumption per unit value added for iron
& steel industry, chemicals industry and eelectricity industry should
be decreased by 18–20 % compared to 2010 levels by 2015, and
total energy saving for all the industries should be 6.7 billion tons
of standard coal equivalent during the 12th FYP period. There is also
a strong emphasis on the elimination of outdated and high energy-
consuming metal-smelting equipments and technology such as 100
A electrolytic aluminium equipment. To reﬂect such initiatives, we
consider the effect of technology eﬃciency improvements on total
demand deﬁcits reduction and hence on the energy-economic recov-
ery resilience. Recall that the jth column vector in the Input-Output
matrix A models a production technology of sector j, and smaller
values of an entry aij implies lower levels of input requirements
from sector i goods to produce one unit of sector j goods. Hence, we
reduce, for each sector j at a time, its column coeﬃcients in A by 5%
from its 2012 values. Models (3)–(8) is then re-solved to evaluate
the corresponding demand deﬁcits in the economy. Table 9 shows
the top ﬁve sectors which, when their eﬃciencies were increased,
resulted in the largest improvement (reduction) in the total demand
deﬁcits. These are the Electricity sector (S36), Manufacture of Raw
Chemical Materials sector (S20), Manufacture of Non-metallic Mineral
Products sector (S25), Smelting and Pressing of Ferrous Metals sec-
tor (S6) and Smelting and Pressing of Non-ferrous Metals sector (S27).
Aside from the fact that improvement in power generation tech-
nology eﬃciency is of fundamental importance, these production
technologies are also identiﬁed with sectors highest in net electric-
ity consumptions in China in 2012. The reasoning for these results
is suggested by Fig. 7, which shows the corresponding total net sup-
ply of the economy in the event of electricity production disruption
under 5% of production eﬃciency improvement in each industry.
Recall that with the 5% of production eﬃciency improvement, the
industries requires fewer inputs (especially electricity) to produce
one unit of their product, hence they have more net supply (out-
put minus intermediate consumption) to meet the ﬁnal demand and
reduce the ﬁnal demand deﬁcits. For those ﬁve sector with highest
in net electricity consumptions, eﬃciency improvement in their pro-
duction technology results in the largest improvement in total net
supply, hence the most reduction in ﬁnal demand deﬁcits.

<Conclusion> Conclusion.
In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to evaluate
the energy-economic recovery resilience of an economy integrat-
ing linear programming and Input-Output analysis that accounts
for uncertainties in production disruptions and also inter-sectoral
dependencies. The models developed are shown to yield problems
in the format of mixed integer linear programming models, which
can be solved eﬃciently using commercial solvers. The proposed
models can serve as valuable decision-support tools for policy-
makers to study the impact of production disruptions on the supply-
demand balances, and also guide planning and allocation of recovery
resources in the economy.

A main ﬁnding of the case study is that the energy recov-
ery resilience of China in 2012 is strongly associated to that of
coal production. In particular, the computational results show that,
among other energy sectors, the Coal sector is often identiﬁed as the
critical sector under disruption. The results also indicate, after the
disruption, production recovery of coal would need to be the highest,
in order to minimize the overall impacts on demand deﬁcits. This is
a consequence of the economic sectors being highly interconnected
and inter-dependent on coal production. This has important impli-
cations on the Chinese energy security outlook since China is the
largest producer and consumer of coal in the world. Next, other than
coal production, disruptions in electricity sector can also result in the
most severe deﬁcits in the economy. The ﬁndings are coherent with
the policy directions formulated in the recent FYPs. In particular, it
is paramount for China to continually pursue the development of
high security and robust power generation assets and systems. It is
also important for sectors with high energy intensity and electricity
consumption to further improve their production eﬃciencies as this
can effectively reduce the impact of electricity disruptions.

There are some directions open for future work. First, multi-
regional studies considering the economic cooperation among dif-
ferent regions or countries can be developed to build a region-based
energy resilience indicator. Second, cross-country or cross-year com-
parisons can be done to better understand one economy’s energy
resilience status quo and to predict its future situation. Third, more
considerations can be given to the methods or ways to improve
energy resilience and quantitatively measure the improvements.
Fourth, more complicated recovery models can be incorporated into
the model for simulating the recovery pattern better and hence
improving the accuracy of the results.
