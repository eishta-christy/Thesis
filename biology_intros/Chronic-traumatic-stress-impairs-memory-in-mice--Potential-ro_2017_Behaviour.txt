1. Introduction

In humans exposure to stressful conditions can result in debilitating
mental disorders with altered memory performances [1–3]. Response to
stress is complex and includes avoidance of contexts and cues asso-
ciated with the stressor. This avoidance behavior is mainly due to de-
velopment of fear memory. In addition to the development of fear
memory, which is often strong and persistent, there could be impair-
ment of other forms of memories, along with the development of an-
xiety and depression as well as physiological changes. While acute
stress and its neurological eﬀects were the focus of several studies,
chronic stress can also disrupt memory performance and change hip-
pocampal cell structure and function [4,5]. Interestingly chronic stress
results in remarkable variability in memory performances [6–8] in-
dicating multiple factors may be involved in modulation of memory
with chronic stress. However, little is known about these factors and
especially their relationship with molecular and physiological processes
that modulate memory.

Strength of the stress is a major factor that is positively correlated to
the stress responses. Traumatic stress such as exposure to predators can
result in strong adverse psychobiological eﬀects in rodents.
Furthermore, exposure to predators [9] better mimic the life threa-
tening stress that is often associated with human stress related psy-
chiatric conditions such as PTSD. Especially ethological relevance and
potency of predator exposure is believed to be a highly relevant ap-
proach for developing an intense, psychological response in rodents [9].
Chronic traumatic stress also has high human health relevance as many
stressors like childhood abuse, sexual abuse or domestic violence can
often be continual in nature. Despite this relevance preclinical research
on chronic traumatic stress is scant and the propensity of chronic pre-
dator stress to develop defective memory performance is not well stu-
died.

The hippocampus located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain is
crucial for formation of memories [10,11]. Patients with stress dis-
orders tend to have lower hippocampal volume and impaired hippo-
campus dependent memories [12–15]. In addition to neurotransmitter
receptors, such as cholinergic receptors, that are involved in the mo-
lecular mechanisms of memory encoding, the neurons in the
hippocampus also express receptors for stress hormones and in-
ﬂammatory mediators [16–19]. The inﬂammatory and stress responses
mediated by these receptors are often disruptive to memory. Elevated
inﬂammatory and immunological responses in the hippocampus are
also associated with certain stress disorders [20–24]. Furthermore, in-
creased levels of stress hormones and inﬂammatory mediators are also
known to cause cell death in the hippocampus and other brain regions
[25–30]. These ﬁndings indicate that stress hormones and inﬂammatory mediators in the hippocampus may play a crucial role in
stress induced memory deﬁcits. In addition to increased inﬂammatory
responses, alterations of neurotrophins are also strongly correlated with
the pathophysiology of stress [31–33]. The stress related and in-
ﬂammation associated cellular processes associated with decreased
memory are not fully understood. Therefore, in this present study we
utilized the rat-mouse predator-prey relationship [34] in order to
analyze the chronic traumatic stress exposure induced behavioral and
molecular changes in mice.

<Middle> Materials and methods.
2.1. Animals and stress procedure.
Male C57BL/B6 mice (1 month old) and old (> 1 year) male Long
Evans rats were housed in standard housing conditions (12 h dark; 12 h
light) with free access to food and water. Rats and mice were housed in
separate rooms. Mice were randomly divided into control and predator
stress groups. All procedures involving live animals were in accordance
with National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and with the animal use protocol approved by
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Chronic traumatic stress in mice was induced by exposure to the
Long Evan rats [34]. Brieﬂy, a mouse was placed inside a clear plastic
hamster ball (Super Pet, Elk Grove Village, IL; material # 100079348)
and then the hamster ball was placed inside the home cage of an ag-
gressive rat for 30 min for 28 consecutive days (Fig. 1). This type of
stress allows visual and olfactory exposure to the predator without di-
rect physical contacts that might lead to injury or death to the mice. An
individual mouse was not exposed to the same rat for two consecutive
days.

2.2. Behavioral procedures

Open ﬁeld activity was studied by placing each mouse at the center
of a rectangular open ﬁeld area (34 cm X 34 cm) and allowing them to
explore for 10 min. Elevated plus maze test was performed as pre-
viously described [35] and the time spent in open and closed arms were
measured. Sucrose preference test was performed by providing mice
with a choice between two identical bottles, one ﬁlled with tap water
and the other with 2% sucrose solution, in their home cages for 48 h.
The bottles were switched after 24 h to avoid any side preference
[34,36]. Amount of sucrose solution consumed was measured.

Radial arm maze (RAM) experiments were performed as previously
described [37] with some minor modiﬁcations. Prior to radial arm maze
experiments mice were diet-restricted to reduce and maintain a body
weight of ∼85.0% of their ad libitum food body weight. During this
period mice were introduced to a food reward (Reese’s peanut butter
chips). Mice were pre-trained for 3 days to associate the maze with the
experience of obtaining the food reward by allowing each animal free
access to all eight arms until food reward from each arm is consumed.
Radial arm maze tests consisted of two phases, each lasting for 5 con-
secutive days and there was one trial per day. Prior to each trial each
mouse was placed in the central chamber of the maze for a two minute
acclimation period. During the ﬁrst test phase (one test/day for 5 days)
mice freely explored all eight arms with each arm baited with the food
reward. For each mouse the trial ended after either collecting the last
food reward or 15 min of elapsed time. In the second phase (one pair of
test/day for 5 days) each mouse was tested twice with 3 min interval
between tests. In the ﬁrst test 4 arms were closed and the remaining 4
arms were baited with the food reward. Mice were individually allowed
to explore the open arms and consume the food reward. This ﬁrst test
ended after the last food reward was consumed or 15 min of elapsed
time and the mouse was taken out and placed in its home cage for the
inter-test interval. In the second test all 8 arms were open but only four
arms that were previously closed were baited with the food reward. The
test ended after either the last food reward was consumed or after
15 min of elapsed time. In between trials the behavioral apparatus were
wiped with 70% ethanol to eliminate odor cues.

2.3. Western blot

Western blot experiments were performed by following standard
protocols that included separation of equal quantities of total proteins
in separate wells of a SDS-PAGE gel and subsequent transfer of proteins
to PVDF membranes. Membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with
the following primary antibodies: anti-interleukin-1β (IL-β; Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-nerve growth factor (NGF;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), anti-brain derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF; Santa Cruz) and β-actin (Cell Signaling). Membranes
were then probed with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase con-
jugated secondary antibody, incubated with SuperSignal® West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL, USA) and
the bands were developed in a ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, California, USA). Band intensities of each membrane were
normalized with corresponding β-actin band intensities using ImageJ
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) program.

2.4. Quantitative RT-PCR

Relative gene expression in the hippocampus was determined by
using a two-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR process com-
bined with Livak’s (2−ΔΔCt) method. Total RNA was extracted and
puriﬁed using the Trizol® Plus PureLink™ RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA concentration and purity was determined by
using a NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Wilmington, DE, USA). An equal amount of starting RNA was used for
subsequent cDNA synthesis by using the qScript™ cDNA SuperMix
(Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The qPCR analysis was
performed using PerfeCTa® SYBR® Green FastMix (Quanta Biosciences,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and the Rotor-Gene® Q HRM System (Quiagen,
Hilden, Germany). Validated Mus musculus primer sets (Table 1) were
obtained from a database [38–40] and 18s rRNA was used as the en-
dogenous control for relative gene expression analysis. The 20 μl qPCR
reaction mix contained 70 ng cDNA, 1 x PerfeCTa® SYBR® Green Fas-
tMix, and 0.25 μM of each forward and reverse primers.

2.5. Acetylcholine determination

Acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus of control and stressed
mice were determined using an Amplex™ Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA; cat# A12217). Brieﬂy, clear supernatants of
tissue samples were prepared and the experiments were performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Fluorescence was detected by
a Syngergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Winooski, Vermont, USA;
excitation = 530 nm, emission = 590 nm). Acetylcholine levels were
calculated from a standard curve and then normalized to the protein
content of the samples.

2.6. Statistical analysis

A two-way analysis of variance (2-way mixed ANOVA) was used to
determine diﬀerences between groups and detect the presence of a two-
way interaction between cohort and time (days) on RAM errors.
Independent samples t-test was used to determine signiﬁcant changes
between groups in all other experimental data. Shaprio-Wilk’s test and
Normal Q-Q plots were used to measure normality. Homogeneity of
variance and covariance were assessed by Levene's Test of Homogeneity
of Variances and Box's M Test, respectively. When appropriate, ad-
justments for multiple comparisons were made by using the Bonferroni
post-hoc test. For all experiments, statistical signiﬁcance was met at a p-
value < 0.05. All data was analyzed with IBM SPSS version 24.

3. Results

3.1. Hippocampus dependent memory was impaired by chronic predator
stress

High intensity stress was shown to impair memory in humans [41].
Patients with stress disorders like PTSD also reported to have reduced
hippocampal volume and memory [42–44]. Here we studied whether
chronic predator stress aﬀected hippocampus dependent memory using
eight arm RAM experiments [45]. In the ﬁrst test phase experiments
control mice exhibited progressively fewer errors during the 5 day
period. Such decreasing trend was not observed in stressed mice and
these mice had more errors than the controls (Fig. 2A; F(1, 6) = 7.324,
p = 0.035). In the second test phase the same set of mice were eval-
uated using a delayed spatial win-shift task (Fig. 2B top panel). Results
of these experiments also shows that the stressed mice had a greater
number of errors than their age matched control mice (Fig. 2B; F(1, 6)
= 9.870, p = 0.020). These results demonstrate chronic predator stress
impairs spatial working memory in mice.

3.2. Chronic predator stress did not induce anxiety or depression

Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorders often include stress as a
comorbid condition [46] and patients with stress disorders also show
hyperactive behavior [47]. Comorbidity of stress, anxiety and depres-
sion is also common in certain subpopulations such as veterans [48].
Hence here we studied whether chronic predator stress causes such
abnormal behaviors in mice. Mouse behavior was assessed in an open
ﬁeld arena. Stressed mice did not show any locomotor hyperactivity as
the mean speed and total distance traveled were not diﬀerent between
stressed and control mice (Fig. 3A–C; speed: t(9) = 2.26, p = 0.06);
total distance: t(8) = 2.30, p = 0.12). Anxiety was evaluated by cal-
culating the time a mouse spent in the center of the open ﬁeld arena and
also by EPM. Results show the amount of time spent in the center of the
open ﬁeld (Fig. 4A; t(14) = 2.14, p = 0.28), time in open arms of EPM
(Fig. 4C; t(14) = 2.14, p = 0.44), and time in closed arms of the EPM
(Fig. 4D; t(14) = 2.14, p = 0.59) were not diﬀerent between control
and stressed mice. These results indicate the chronic traumatic stress
protocol did not induce anxiety in mice.

Sucrose preference test was performed to study depression in both
groups of mice. Results of these experiments reveal the sucrose pre-
ference of control mice was not diﬀerent from that of stressed mice
(Fig. 4E; t(14) = 2.14, p = 0.13). These results suggest that chronic
predator stress does not induce anhedonia, a hallmark symptom of
human depression [49–51].

3.3. Neurotrophins were not altered in response to chronic predator stress

Stress in humans is often associated with altered neurotrophin sig-
naling [52,53]. Furthermore, brain neurotrophin signaling is altered in
response to stress and also in depression, one of the adverse behavioral
phenotype of stress disorders [54–56]. Therefore, using western blot
analysis we measured the levels of NGF and BDNF in the hippocampus.
Mature/pro-BDNF ratio of stressed mice was not diﬀerent from that of
the controls (Fig. 5A; t(6) = 2.44, p = 0.22). Similarly mature/pre-
cursor ratios of NGF were also not diﬀerent between the stressed and
control groups (Fig. 5B; t(6) = 2.44, p = 0.05). These results suggest
BDNF and NGF signaling was not aﬀected by the chronic stress.

3.4. Hippocampal CRH gene expression was modiﬁed by chronic predator
stress

To further investigate the impact of stress we quantiﬁed the gene
expression levels of stress associated factors in the hippocampus. Levels
of CRH mRNA in the hippocampus of stressed mice were lower than
those of controls (Fig. 6A; t(6) = 7.39, p = 0.0003). There were no
diﬀerences in glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1; Fig. 6A; t(6) = 0.21,
p = 0.83), mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2; Fig. 6A; t(6) = 0.22,
p = 0.82), zinc ﬁnger protein, ZIF-268 (EGR1; Fig. 6B; t(6) = −0.96,
p = 0.37), activity regulated cytoskeleton associated protein (Arc;
Fig. 6B; t(6) = −0.87.39, p = 0.41), and Fos proto-oncogene (c-Fos;
Fig. 6B; t(6) = −1.20, p = 0.27) mRNA levels between stressed and
control groups. These results illustrate that chronic stress resulted in the
downregulation of CRH gene expression but did not alter the expres-
sions of glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid receptors or immediate-early
genes.

3.5. Chronic predator stress induced proinﬂammatory response and
decreased acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus.
Since stress can induce inﬂammatory responses in neurons [57] we
studied the protein levels of IL-1β in the hippocampus. Results show
that the ratio of mature/precursor IL-1β levels was increased in stressed
mice when compared to the controls (Fig. 7A; t(6) = 2.44, p = 0.03).
This indicates that chronic predator stress induced inﬂammatory re-
sponses in the hippocampus and such responses might persist even in
the absence of other molecular markers of stress. Inﬂammatory sig-
naling in the body also involves cholinergic signaling [58,59] and re-
duced cholinergic signaling may impair memory performance of mice
in radial arm maze [60,61]. Therefore, we determined the levels of
acetylcholine in the hippocampus of mice to ascertain whether chronic
predator stress induced changes in the levels of this neurotransmitter.
Results of these experiments illustrate that the acetylcholine content of
hippocampus from stressed mice was reduced (Fig. 7B; t(6) = −0.03,
p = 0.03). This indicates that chronic stress reduced hippocampal
acetylcholine content and this reduction might have contributed to the
radial arm maze memory impairments.

<Conclusion> Discussion.

Here we show that chronic predator stress for 28 days caused deﬁ-
cits in working memory, decreased CRH gene expression, reduced
acetylcholine levels and increased the proinﬂammatory cytokine IL-1β
in the hippocampus of adolescent mice. Interestingly these changes
were not accompanied by anxiety, anhedonia or changes in locomotor
activity. Furthermore, levels of neurotrophins such as BDNF and NGF
were not altered. Memory deﬁcits observed in our study are consistent
with some previous reports [62–64] and could be due to decreased CRH
expression in the hippocampus as CRH signaling is implicated in
memory processing in rodents. Low levels of CRH were reported in
patients with Alzheimer’s disease [65,66] and increasing free CRH le-
vels enhanced cognition [67,68]. Direct injection of CRH into the hip-
pocampus also increased memory retention in rats [69]. These ﬁndings
support our results suggesting that reduced expression of CRH in the
hippocampus of stressed mice could be a factor underlying memory
deﬁcits.

Predatory exposure is a strong psychological stress and therefore
initial exposures to the predator may have caused strong elevations in
adrenocorticotropic hormone leading to reduced CRH expression [70].
Since the predator exposures did not accompany any other noxious
stimuli or physical harm, subsequent chronic exposures might have led
to stress desensitization and to a stress non-responsive period [71,72].
Reduction in CRH expression is likely sustained during this potential
non-responsive period because CRH mRNA levels were shown to be
unchanged in types of stress (chronic immobilization or cold exposure)
associated with desensitization of the ACTH responses [73]. CRH could
be a key molecule regulating memory as a previous studies showed a
positive correlation between central CRH levels and acetylcholine re-
lease [74]. The decreased acetylcholine levels found in our study may
be due to decreased CRH transcript levels. Since increased acetylcholine
release was reported during working memory performance [75] and
hippocampal cholinergic signaling is associated with cognition [76],
the memory deﬁcits observed in our study could be due to decreased
cholinergic signaling in combination with decreased CRH levels.
Impaired memory in the stressed mice could also be partly due to
elevated levels of IL-1β levels because IL-1β and cognition are nega-
tively correlated [77,78]. Increased IL-1β levels in stressed mice found
in our study are supported by other reports with similar ﬁndings in-
dicating both acute and chronic psychological stress can induce in-
ﬂammation in the hippocampus [79–81]. Interestingly, enhanced IL-1β
levels can also cause endocrine, neurochemical and behavioral mani-
festations similar to those produced by psychological stress [82,83]. In
relevance to our results, CRH is also reported to modulate inﬂammation
[84]. This suggests that IL-1β, stress related hormones, their targets,
and cholinergic signaling in the brain may be involved in a feed forward
loop, modulating stress, inﬂammation, and memory.

In contrast to other studies [53,55,85] our results do not include a
change in BDNF or NGF levels in the hippocampus of stressed mice.
However, our results are consistent with another study that showed
chronic restraint stress for three weeks did not alter the BDNF gene
expression in the hippocampus of rats [86]. Additionally, random and
variable physical or social stress regimens for 4 weeks impaired hip-
pocampus dependent memory but did not aﬀect the BDNF expression
[87]. Stress induced decrease in hippocampal BDNF levels returned to
normal levels after a 21 day recovery period suggesting alterations in
BDNF in the hippocampus due to stress could be transient [88]. These
results suggest that relationship between hippocampal BDNF expression
and stress is highly dynamic and that cognitive deﬁcits caused by
psychological stress do not always accompany alterations in BDNF le-
vels. Previous studies reported a decline in NGF levels in the hippo-
campus of animals that experienced chronic stress [55,89,90], however,
our results and some other reports did not identify alterations in NGF
levels in the hippocampus of stressed adult animals [91]. Another study
reported an increase in NGF levels in the hippocampus of rats that
experienced chronic stress [92]. These variabilities in neurotrophin
expression levels in the hippocampus of stressed animals could be due
to multiple factors including the age, strain, intrusiveness of the
stressor, stress duration, and stress-free recovery time.
Several studies also reported increased anxiety in animals subjected
to chronic stress [93–96]. Most of these studies used more physically
intrusive stressors like restraint or foot shock. Chronic psychosocial
stress that did not include any punitive physical stressors seem not to be
strong enough to induce EPM anxiety in rats but a chronic non- social
stressor (restraint stress) resulted in enhanced EPM anxiety [97]. Age
and strain of mice selected for research can also inﬂuence the beha-
vioral outcomes of stress [98–101]. The mouse strain used in this study
(C57BL/B6) has been shown to develop strong autonomic nervous
system eﬀects upon stress [98] and therefore suitable to develop animal
models of stress. Age is also another crucial factor that can determine
the onset of behavioral abnormalities resulting from stress. In our study
we used adolescent mice [102,103] because this age group is more
susceptible to stress than adult mice [104–106]. Sex also seem to play a
role in the susceptibility for anxiogenesis as only male but not female
rats showed EPM anxiety in response to predator induced psychosocial
stress [107]. Therefore, inconsistencies between our results, particu-
larly the lack of anxiety or anhedonia, and some other previous reports
could be attributable to the variations in strain, age, sex, and the nature
of stress in terms of severity and duration. In addition, a stress free
period between the termination of chronic stress and evaluation of
anxiety may also result in blunting of anxiety [108]. Chronic stress has
also been shown to result in anhedonia in animals [108–111], a be-
havioral outcome that was not detected in our study. Stress induced
anhedonia may also not persist for a long time after the cessation of
stress [112], suggesting that the stress free period may be a factor for
the lack of anhedonia observed in our study. Collectively the lack of
anxiety and anhedonia reported in our study could be due to adaptation
and resilience to the physically non-intrusive stress.

Our results show that chronic predator exposure did not induce any
changes in the expression of immediate early genes, Arc, cFos or
Zif268/EGR1. Expressions of these genes are implicated in the proces-
sing of memories [113–116]. Several studies have shown that acute as

well as chronic stress can cause changes in the expression of small,
regulatory, noncoding microRNAs [117–119]. Alterations in hippo-
campal microRNA is also correlated with cholinergic signaling, in-
dicating a central role of reduced cholinergic signaling for the impaired
memory performance of stressed mice in our study [120,121]. Inter-
estingly, one study reported increased IL-1β levels and memory re-
consolidation impairment were accompanied by decreased expression
of ZIF268 [122]. Taken together our results indicate that memory im-
pairment does not require altered expression of these immediate early
genes in the hippocampus.

Chronic stress can also result in the development of resilience.
Notably, Psychosocial stress induced elevations in corticosterones are
also short-lived [123–125]. Small increases in IL-1 has been shown
result in adaptive responses and leading to better coping [126] sug-
gesting modest increase of this proinﬂammatory molecule can promote
the development of resilience to chronic stress. While the development
of resilience can prevent or reduce fear memory and mood disorders
other forms of memory could still be aﬀected. In this context, our re-
sults suggest memory, particularly higher order complex working
memory, is more susceptible than the vulnerability to develop anxiety.
Furthermore, our results show that the memory disruptions caused by
stress can persist for a long time during a stress free period.

In summary, our results indicate chronic predator stress causes
memory deﬁcits along with congruent decreases in CRH gene expres-
sion, acetylcholine levels, and increased inﬂammation in the hippo-
campus of mice. These ﬁndings suggest that these could be major de-
terminants of long lasting non-fear memory decline that develops after
chronic traumatic stress. Thus these data highlight a role for hippo-
campal CRH, cholinergic signaling, and inﬂammation in the complex
stress-activated hippocampal dysfunction, suggesting potential ther-
apeutic strategies.
