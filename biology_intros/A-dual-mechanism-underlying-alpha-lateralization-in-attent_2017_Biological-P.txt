Introduction
The visual system has limited processing capacity, so simultaneous
stimuli present in the visual ﬁeld mutually suppress their evoked ac-
tivity in the visual cortex. Competition between stimuli can be resolved
by top-down mechanisms, such as selective attention, or by bottom-up
stimulus-driven mechanisms, such as saliency. Selective attention to the
behavioral relevant stimuli is considered a top-down process, in which
high-level processing areas in the prefrontal and posterior parietal
cortices, exert a biasing signal towards the visual regions processing the
relevant items (Miller & D’Esposito, 2005). As a consequence, sensory
regions show increased activity for the relevant vs the irrelevant items
(Armstrong, Fitzgerald, & Moore, 2006; Buﬀalo, Fries, Landman,
Liang, & Desimone, 2010), making stimulus processing more accurate
(Richter, Thompson, Bosman, & Fries, 2017). Neural synchrony seems
to be a key mechanism to enhance neural representation of the attended
sensory input. Several models postulate that gamma and alpha band
oscillations play a pivotal role in top-down processes such as selective
attention, with antagonist roles (Fries, Reynolds, Rorie, & Desimone,
2001; 2008; Oostenveld, & Desimone, Fries, Womelsdorf,
Jensen & Mazaheri, 2010; Klimesch et al., 2007; Womelsdorf, Fries,
Mitra, & Desimone, 2006). Whereas gamma synchronization represents
a high excitability state of the underlying neural population (Fries et al.,
2001), and is thus associated with processing of information; alpha
synchronization represents a state of low excitability and has been as-
sociated with the functional inhibition of task-irrelevant regions
(Jensen & Mazaheri, 2010). In this line, alpha modulation in visual
areas represents an anticipatory visuospatial attention correlate. Some
experiments have found an alpha power increase (or alpha synchroni-
zation) ipsilateral to the attended hemiﬁeld related to the suppression
of unattended neural representations (Kelly, Lalor, Reilly, & Foxe, 2006;
Rihs, Michel, & Thut, 2007;Worden, Foxe, Wang, & Simpson, 2000),
whereas others have found an alpha power decrease (or desynchroni-
zation) contralateral to the attended hemiﬁeld (Kelly, Gomez-
Ramirez, & Foxe, 2009; Sauseng et al., 2005; Yamagishi, Goda, Callan,
Anderson, & Kawato, 2005) linked to enhancement of neural excit-
ability in cortical areas processing the attended stimulus.
Like visuospatial attention, working memory (WM) has capacity
restrictions, in which only limited amount of information can be re-
presented during a short interval. Top-down mechanisms have been
shown to operate during the maintenance interval to optimize WM
performance (Griﬃn & Nobre, 2003; Lepsien & Nobre, 2007). Ad-
ditionally, recent theoretical conceptualizations highlight the ﬂexible
nature of memory representations, which are maintained in diﬀerent
accessibility states and the allocation of attention can move them into a
high prioritized state (Lewis-Peacock & Postle, 2012; LaRocque, Lewis-
Peacock, Drysdale, Oberauer, & Postle, 2013; Zokaei, Manohar,
Husain, & Feredoes, 2013, Zokaei, Ning, Manohar, Feredoes, & Husain,
2014; Heuer & Schubö, 2016a). An eﬃcient experimental strategy to
study the beneﬁt of orienting attention to representations already held
in WM is presenting a spatial cue during the retention period indicating
which item is likely to be probed. This is widely known as the retro-cue
paradigm, because the cue is provided after the memory set is encoded.
The use of this paradigm has demonstrated that orienting attention to
perceptual representation, this is, before encoding, and orienting at-
tention to memory representation, this is, after encoding, exhibit a si-
milar behavioral beneﬁt (Griﬃn & Nobre, 2003; Myers, Walther, Wallis,
Stokes, & Nobre, 2015). In addition, both processes elicit a similar
modulation of evoked visual activity (Griﬃn & Nobre, 2003). These
results suggest that a common set of attentional control (i.e. top-down)
mechanisms can be used in both cognitive contexts, this is, when se-
lecting items in the outside world, and when selecting items among
internal representations (i.e., WM). While there is abundant research
about the patterns of neural oscillatory activity underlying attentional
processes in the perceptual domain, the modulation of oscillatory ac-
tivity by the retro-cue has been much less studied.

Similarly to orienting attention to the perceptual space, retro-cue
experiments also ﬁnd an alpha modulation related to orienting atten-
tion to memory representations (Nobre, Gitelman, Dias, & Mesulam,
2000; Kastner & Ungerleider, 2001; Poch, Campo, & Barnes, 2014;
Wallis, Stokes, Cousijn, Woolrich, & Nobre, 2015; Mok, Myers,
Wallis, & Nobre, 2016; Schneider, Mertes, & Wascher, 2016). However,
contrary to the much studied phenomenon in perception, the char-
acteristics of alpha modulations in WM are still under examination.

Visuospatial attention experiments have proven useful to disen-
tangle the neural generators of alpha modulation in order to determine
its functionality. A recent MEG study found two dissociated generators
of alpha activity related to diﬀerent attentional mechanisms (Capilla,
Schoﬀelen, Paterson, Thut, & Gross, 2014). While alpha ipsilateral in-
creases arised from the dorsal stream to support attentional shifts,
contralateral alpha suppression in the ventral occipital cortex was re-
lated to feature processing. This dissociation would be of great re-
levance in WM as it could provide further understanding of sensory
recruitment proposals which posit that maintenance of information is
accomplished by sensory cortices (Postle, 2006; Serences, Ester,
Vogel, & Awh, 2009).

Whether item prioritization needs sustained attention to encoded
information or not is matter of debate. Some authors have argued that
retro-cue guides attention to the relevant item, and that it stays under
focal attention until probe presentation (Makovsik & Jiang, 2007;
Matsukura, Luck, & Vecera, 2007; Makovski, Sussman, & Jiang, 2008;
Pertzov, Bays, Joseph, & Husain, 2013). However, other authors have
found that sustained attention is not needed for the beneﬁt of the retro
cue (Hollingworth & Maxcey-Richard, 2013; Rerko, Souza, & Oberauer,
2014). Convergently, electrophysiological experiments have found a
transient alpha lateralization related to attentional orienting (Mok
et al., 2016; Myers et al., 2015; Wallis et al., 2015). In this line, it has
been proposed that transient alpha desynchronization is an index of
access to memory representation and, once a representation is accessed,
a change in the representational state takes place and alpha modulation
is no longer needed (Wolﬀ, Jochim, Akyürek, & Stokes, 2017).

Behavioural studies have found divergent results about the extent of
the retro-cue beneﬁt. Some authors reported that retrocue beneﬁts are
observed only for one single item (Makovsik & Jiang, 2007), while
others have found that is possible to retrospectively orient attention to
more than one (Heuer & Schubö, 2016b). Electrophysiological retro-cue
studies have mainly explored the eﬀects of retro-cueing one item
(Griﬃn & Nobre, 2003; Myers, Stokes, & Nobre, 2017; Schneider et al.,
2016). To our knowledge, the only electrophysiological work manip-
ulating retro-cued load found that alpha power was modulated by re-
levant cued information (Manza, Hau, & Leung, 2014). However, this
study used bilateral arrays, so it did not address alpha lateralization
diﬀerences related to selecting varying amounts of items.

In the present study we use a retro-cue paradigm with three con-
ditions, one-cue, two-cue, and neutral-cue. We explore the dynamics of
alpha band activity related to the retro-cue and use source localization
to address the issues previously exposed. We hypothesized that ac-
cording to a current theory of item prioritization (Myers et al., 2017),
alpha desynchronization would transiently emerge from areas coding
sensory information. Furthermore, accordingly to this model, the two-
cue condition would be expected to produce a more pronounced alpha
lateralization respect to one-cue with greater disinhibition of the con-
tralateral sensory cortex.

<Middle> Methods.
1.1. Participants.
Seventeen adult subjects [mean age, 25.36 years; standard deviation
(SD), 3.13 years; range, 22–32 years; nine females], without any history
of neurological or psychiatric illness, volunteered for participation in
the study, which was approved by the local ethical committee of the
Center of Biomedical Technology (Madrid, Spain), and gave written
consent, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, after the nature
of the procedures involved had been explained to them. Participants
were right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory
(Oldﬁeld 1971).

1.2. Stimuli and tasks
The experimental task was adapted from a retro-cueing paradigm
developed by Giﬀrin and Nobre (Griﬃn & Nobre, 2003;
Lepsien & Nobre, 2006) and is illustrated in Fig. 1. At the start of each
trial, participants ﬁrst saw a white central ﬁxation cross lasting
1000 ms. This was followed by a sample memory set, consisting of four
gray rectangles with diﬀerent orientations (0°, 45o, 90 o,13o) displayed
in four locations on a black background. Each rectangle size was of
7.62° of visual angle and their center was located at 7.62° eccentricity
for the horizontal and vertical planes. The to-be remembered array
remained on the screen for 200 ms, in order to discourage participants
from making saccadic eye movements to scan the individual items.
After a 1000 ms delay interval, participants could be presented with
either an informative spatial cue (i.e. retro-cue) or with a non-in-
formative cue (i.e. neutral cue). The retro-cue consisted of one or two
arrows originating from the ﬁxation cross pointing to one or two of the
four locations that had been occupied by a rectangle in the memory
array, thus indicating the item or items that will be subsequently
probed (validity 100%)
(Lepsien, Griﬃn, Devlin, & Nobre, 2005;
Matsukura et al., 2007). The neutral cue consisted of four arrows ori-
ginating from the ﬁxation cross pointing to each of the four locations,
thus providing no information regarding the relevant item. Cues were
presented for 200 ms, and were followed by another 1000-ms delay
interval. Finally, participants were presented with a single rectangle in
one location for 1500 ms, during which they were required to respond.
The task was to indicate, by button press, whether the probe had the
same orientation as the memory item. Following this response period, a
blank screen was shown for 1800 ms before the onset of the next trial
(Fig. 1). A total of 360 trials were presented, of which 120 had retro-
cues indicating one location, 120 had retro-cues indicating two loca-
tions, and 120 had neutral cues. Cues pointing to one or two locations
were used in order to determine whether attention can be reoriented
within WM to more than one item, such as in the perceptual space
(Awh & Pashler, 2000; Makovski & Jiang, 2007; Matsukura & Vecera,
2015). The experiment lasted for ∼40 min, and was performed in one
single session during MEG scanning.

1.3. Behavioral analysis
Analysis of performance was assessed in accuracy and reaction
times (RTs). Accuracy was calculated as the hit minus false alarm rate.
Only RTs of correct responses were included in the analysis. In order to
investigate the benefit of directing attention to memory representations,
an ANOVA was conducted for detection rate and another for RTs
with three levels: one-element, two-element, neutral.
Differential effects of cue side were investigated on detection rates
and RTs by a 2 ×2 ANOVA with factors Cue Side (left vs right) and
Load (one-cue vs two-cue elements).
1.4. Data acquisition
MEG data were obtained with a whole-head 306-channel
Vectorview system (Elekta-Neuromag, Helsinki, Finland), consisting of
102 magnetometers and 204 orthogonal planar gradiometers. Electrooculographic
(EOG) data were recorded supra- and infraorbitally
(vertical EOG) as well as from the left vs right orbital rim (horizontal
EOG). The signal was recorded continuously at a sampling rate of
600 Hz with an online bandpass filter from 0.1 to 200 Hz. The head
position relative to the sensor array was measured at the beginning of
the session with four head position indicator coils. Prior to the recording
session, the anatomical landmarks (nasion and auricular) and
extra points of the head shape were obtained with a 3D digitiser
(Fastrak Polhemus, Colchester, VA, USA). Visually detectable bad
channels were removed prior to signal preprocessing. External noise
was removed with the signal space separation method implemented
with MAX filter software (Taulu et al., 2004). Further analyses were
performed with SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). Data were
first filtered with a cutoff of 150 Hz and downsampled to 300 Hz and
filtered with a high cutoff of 150 Hz. We then epoched data from
500 ms before memory array presentation to 1000 ms after the presentation
of the probe, for each trial, for each condition, for each participant.
Trials were visually inspected, and rejected when they contained
sensor or muscular artefacts, and/or eye blinks.
1.5. Time–frequency analysis
Time-frequency (TF) representations of the data were performed
convoluting trial data with Morlet wavelets (7 cycles width), for the
interval 4–80 Hz in 1 Hz steps. TF representations were computed in-
dependently for vertical and horizontal planar gradiometers, and then
averaged independently for each condition. Averaged data from the
102 pairs of channels were combined over both directions, by means of
the Pythagoras rule, to obtain a single number positive-valued. Finally,
averaged data were log-relative rescaled (dB) using the average power
from −400 ms to −100 ms preceding the onset of the memory array
(i.e., 1600 ms before cue onset), to obtain TF power estimates for each
subject and each condition at 102 locations.

1.5.1. Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric cluster
analysis as implemented in ﬁeldtrip (“http://www.ﬁeldtriptoolbox.
org’) (Maris & Oostenveld, 2007) which controls for Type error I.
First, time-frequency data were average in the alpha range (8–14 Hz). A
t-test was then computed between each sensor-time point. P-values
below 0.05 were used to form clusters of adjacent time points and
electrodes. A minimum of two channels were used to form a cluster.
Cluster-level statistic was calculated by summing t-values within a
cluster. Signiﬁcance of the cluster statistic was evaluated by a permu-
tation test. The permutation distribution was obtained by randomly
assigning the data to two subsets and calculating the maximum cluster
statistic. A histogram of cluster statistics was obtained by repeating the
previous step 1000 times. Cluster p-value is then obtained as the pro-
portion of randomizations that are above the observed cluster-level
statistic.
1.6. Source analysis.
The linearly constrained minimum variance scalar beamformer
spatial ﬁlter algorithm (Sekihara, Nagarajan, Poeppel, & Marantz,
2004), as implemented in SPM8, was used to generate maps of source
activity in a 10-mm grid, with the use of a single-shell forward model ﬁt
to the inner skull surface of the inverse normalised SPM template
(Nolte, 2003). Coregistration to MNI space was carried out with the
three anatomical landmarks and the extra digitized points. Based on the
results of the TF analysis, two 300 ms windows were deﬁned and Fast
Fourier Transform was applied with a Hanning window. Spatial ﬁlter
was constructed based on the covariance matrix of all trials in the
frequency range of 8–14 Hz using a 10% regularization. The spectral
resolution of a 300 ms window is 3.33 Hz, thus, the frequency bins
included in the covariance matrix were 9.9 Hz and 13.3 Hz. Only the
real part was utilized in the covariance matrix. To explore the sources
relative to alpha desynchronization, the time covariance window cor-
responding to 300ms–0 ms before memory array presentation and
250–550 ms after cue onset was utilized. Alpha increase was explored
using the time covariance window corresponding to 300 ms baseline
and the 550–850 ms interval after cue presentation. Summary statistics
images were calculated based on the power spectral density by sub-
tracting the baseline period (300 ms before memory array presentation)
image from the active time period, generating four volumetric images
for each participant. The images were then smoothed using a Gaussian
kernel at 10 mm FWHM and subjected to a group random eﬀects ana-
lysis. Average eﬀect of condition (this is, greater or lower activation
than baseline), was performed independently for the right- and left-
hemiﬁeld conditions for each time interval by means of Student t-test.
Signiﬁcant parametric maps were thresholded at p < 0.05 FWE for the
whole brain volume. To estimate the signiﬁcance of the main eﬀects of
hemisphere, hemiﬁeld, load and its interactions a 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA
with Hemisphere (ipsilateral vs contralateral), Hemiﬁeld (left vs. right),
and Load (one-cue vs. two-cue) as main factors was performed.

2. Results

2.1. Behavioral results

Analysis of the behavioral data revealed that there was a signiﬁcant
beneﬁt in the use of the spatial retro-cue compared to when no spatial
information about the upcoming target was presented. This beneﬁt was
observed both in accuracy and RT.

A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the factor
Condition (one-element, two-element, neutral) for detection rate re-
vealed a main eﬀect of Condition (F (2,32) = 23.99, P < 0.001).
Planned comparisons showed that participants were more accurate in
the one-element condition (mean = 0.89, SD = 0.16) than in the two-
element
(16) = 5.05,
p < 0.001), and than in the neutral condition (mean = 0.72;
SD = 0.15) (t (16) = 6.8, p < 0.001). We also observed a trend for a
better performance in the two-element condition than in the neutral
condition (t (16) = 2.09, p = 0.053).

RTs also showed a main eﬀect of stimulus condition (F (2,32)
= 234.83, p < 0.001), revealing that participants’ reaction time sig-
niﬁcantly increased with increasing number of to-be-attended items.
Participants were slower in the neutral condition (mean = 509.89 ms,
SD = 58.45 ms) than in both the one-element (mean = 386.05 ms,
SD = 51 ms) (t (16) = 17.14, p < 0.001), and the two-element con-
ditions
(16) = 5.23,
P < 0.001). Participants were also slower in the two-element condi-
tion than in the one-element condition (t (16) = 17.07, p < 0.001).

Analysis of cue direction revealed an advantage for right hemiﬁeld
cues compared to the left hemiﬁeld cues. Accuracy and RTs were sig-
niﬁcantly aﬀected by cueing direction (F (1,16) = 8.792, p < 0.005; F
(1,16) = 19.87, p < 0.001; respectively). Individuals presented higher
accuracy for right targets (mean = 0.86, SD = 0.13) compared to left
targets (mean = 0.81, SD = 0.16); as well as faster RTs for right cued
items (mean = 422.07 ms, SD = 54.83) than for left cued items
(mean = 448.41 ms, SD = 55.44).

2.2. MEG results

We computed TF representation in gradiometer planar sensors.
Unlike magnetometer sensors, planar gradiometer can proportionate
the location of the maximum just above the corresponding source, so
lateralization eﬀects are easy to interpret from the topography. TF
analysis showed alpha modulation in posterior sensors (Fig. 2). Time-
course of alpha activity showed an initial desynchronization followed
by a synchronization sustained until target presentation. Crucially, this
oscillatory modulation seems to be lateralized with respect to the cued
side. Alpha topographies are depicted for right, left and neutral con-
dition at 300 ms intervals, starting from 250 ms after the cue onset
(Fig. 3). An initial desynchronization is seen in posterior lateral sensors
followed by a synchronization in posterior central sensors. To assess the
signiﬁcance of alpha lateralization, a nonparametric randomization test
controlling for multiple comparisons over sensors and time was applied.
Comparing ipsilateral vs contralateral sensors revealed a signiﬁcant
cluster of temporooccipital sensors in the time period ranging from
330 ms post cue until probe presentation (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4A). When
testing for a load eﬀect, statistical analysis revealed an occipital non-
lateralized cluster over the time period 620 ms to probe presentation
(p < 0.001) (Fig. 4A). Cluster analysis also revealed that lateralization
eﬀects were stronger in the right cued hemiﬁeld condition than in the
left cue condition (p < 0.05) at the end of the maintenance period
(710–1200 ms).

In most cases, alpha lateralization refers to the diﬀerence between
the two hemispheres (or two conditions-right and left), so modulation
occur when one hemisphere is more or less synchronized than the
other. This makes it diﬃcult to assess whether the experimental manipulation leads to more desynchronization of
the contralateral hemisphere (related to processing of relevant information) or to less
desynchronization of the ipsilateral one (related to the inhibition of
distractors). It is then useful to compare the spatial cueing condition
with a neutral condition in which the cue does not require an atten-
tional orientation and therefore no lateralization is expected. Here we
compare the spatial retro-cue condition with a neutral condition in
which no spatial information is provided. Comparing the neutral and
the two-cue condition revealed that the later elicited a larger desyn-
chronization in a contralateral temporooccipital cluster in the time
period 360–880 ms (p < 0.025). However, the two-cue condition
presented more synchronization in a later cluster (760–1200 ms) in the
ipsilateral occipital hemisphere (p < 0.025) (Fig. 4B).

Topographies suggested diﬀerent generating sources for the alpha
desynchronization and synchronization. Therefore, alpha activity was
source reconstructed in 300 ms intervals. For the first inverted period
alpha desynchronization was located to the ventral lateral occipital
cortex for left- and right-cue conditions (p < 0.05, FWE corrected)
(Fig. 5). The minimum peak for either condition was located in the
cortex contralateral to the cued hemifield (right condition [-36 –78
−6]); left condition [42 –84 −4]). Comparison of contralateral and
ipsilateral alpha sources revealed that alpha activity in the contralateral
cortex was significantly lower than in the ipsilateral cortex [29 –92
−10] (p < 0.001, small volume corrected). Source inversion of the
subsequent time period showed revealed an ipsilateral alpha increase
located in the occipital cortex (p < 0.05, FWE corrected). Maximal
activity for both right- and left-cue conditions occurred in the visual
cortex ipsilateral to the cued hemifield (right condition [20 –92 14]);
left condition [-16 –92 4]). Statistical analysis revealed that alpha activity
was significantly higher in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the cue
compared to the contralateral hemisphere [-36 –88 14] (p < 0.001,
small volume corrected). Additionally, in this window there was an
effect of load, with greater activity for two-cue compared to one-cue
was located to the non-lateralized occipital cortex.
<Conclusion> Discussion.
Previous studies have found that the allocation of attention to external
space and to mnemonic representations induces similar oscillatory
modulations in the alpha band in posterior sensory regions. In the
present work we explored dynamics of alpha oscillatory activity and its
underlying sources while participants oriented attention to one or two
items within WM.
Presentation of the retro-cue elicited an initial alpha desynchronization
followed by a resynchronization. This alpha modulation is in
accordance with the time-course typically obtained in relation to the
presentation of a stimulus (Klimesch, Sauseng, & Hanslmayr, 2007).
Non-parametrical statistical analysis revealed that alpha power was
lateralized respect to the cue side in a cluster of temporooccipital
sensors. Previous studies have found alpha lateralization in relation to
the retro-cue (Myers et al., 2015; Mok et al., 2016; Poch et al., 2014;
Schneider et al., 2016; Wallis et al., 2015). Alpha lateralization is a
robust correlate of visuospatial attention and can be reflected in an α-
band decrease contralateral to the attended hemifield (Gould,
Rushworth, & Nobre, 2011; Rihs, Michel, & Thut, 2009; Thut, Nietzel,
Brandt, & Pascual-Leone, 2006), and/or an ipsilateral increase (Capilla
et al., 2014; Rihs et al., 2009; Worden et al., 2000).

Topographical inspection of alpha activity revealed that following
the retro-cue, contralateral temporooccipital sensors presented a
stronger desynchronization. Neuronal sources accounting for this eﬀect
were located in the temporooccipital cortex. Following this initial de-
synchronization, alpha activity re-synchronized over ipsilateral occi-
pital sensors which was located to the medial occipital cortex. The
anatomical and temporal segregation of these generators could be ac-
commodated in a recent theoretical framework. A recent model pro-
poses that WM prioritization could be accomplished in a multi-step
process (Myers et al., 2017). After retro-cue presentation, attention is
oriented to the cued item which permits the selection of this item. Se-
lection of the cued memoranda would result in the activation of the
neural population coding for this item. After this selection step, the
memory item would be reformatted into another representational state
where sustained attention would be no longer needed. Under this ap-
proach, the ﬁnding of alpha desynchronization in the ventral extra-
striate cortex could be reﬂecting access to memory representation. This
region is engaged in processing geometrical ﬁgures (Flowers et al.,
2004) like the memorandum stimuli of our task. Alpha desynchroni-
zation has been shown to correlate with neural excitability (Haegens,
Händel, & Jensen, 2011), and thus could be indexing the activation of
neural populations coding the selected item. This explanation would ﬁt
well with previous interpretations of alpha lateralization. In these stu-
dies, alpha lateralization was transient and thus it was hypothesized to
reﬂect access to representations to change them into a more robust state
(Myers et al., 2015; Wallis et al., 2015). However, in another case, it has
been interpreted to reﬂect active retention of the cued items (Schneider
et al., 2016). However, in this last study the sustained lateralization was
not entirely clear as no signiﬁcant lateralization was obtained in the last
period of the longest SOA (1400–1800 ms). Results obtained from
comparison of the two-cue condition with the neutral condition would
further support the transient access account. If alpha lateralization were
indicating sustained retention of memory items, neutral and two-cue
conditions would have presented the same degree of desynchronization
as both had two relevant items in one hemisphere. However, two-cue
condition presented more contralateral desynchronization compared to
the neutral condition in a temporooccipital cluster in a transient early
window. Thus, probably reﬂecting transient access to memory re-
presentations. While our ﬁnding is merely empirical and interpretation
speculative, there is a study describing a causal relation between re-
tinotopic areas and retro-cue beneﬁt. Speciﬁcally, applying TMS to
SMG or LOC, depending of the cue feature (spatial or color), facilitated
retro-cued items of the contralateral hemisphere (Heuer,
Schubö, & Crawford, 2016). While it was not tested, authors hypothe-
sized that rTMS delivered at alpha frequency could have modulated
alpha activity with a facilitatory eﬀect.
In turn, alpha synchronization over occipital ipsilateral cortex in a
later stage would have a less clear role. Alpha synchronization has been
previously related with the functional inhibition of distracting items
(Bonnefond & Jensen, 2012). Alpha activity increase over irrelevant-
task areas have been found to correlate with optimal performance
(Haegens, Osipova, Oostenveld, & Jensen, 2010) which have led to the
proposal of inﬂuential model of “gating by inhibition”
(Jensen & Mazaheri, 2010). Accordingly, relevant information is routed
to processing areas by blocking oﬀ the task-irrelevant pathways. In the
case of this study it is diﬃcult to determine whether alpha activity
increase is related to the inhibition of irrelevant items or to the in-
hibition of the irrelevant external space. In fact, when comparing two-
cue with the neutral condition, in addition to the early contralateral
desynchronization in the former, we found that an occipital ipsilateral
cluster presented higher synchronization compared to neutral condition
in a late window. This could be related to the inhibition of the two
irrelevant items or the upcoming irrelevant hemiﬁeld. Given that alpha
increase arised from an early area of visual processing in a later tem-
poral stage it could be reasonable to argue that it might be involved in
the anticipation of the upcoming probe. However, the design of this
experiment cannot dissociate between these two possibilities. To unravel
its contribution, it would be necessary to vary the number of irrelevant
items in forthcoming experiments.
There is a debate whether it is possible to prioritize more than one
item in WM (for a review see Souza & Oberauer, 2016). Here, we found
that orienting attention to one item was more advantageous than orienting
to two items. Orienting to two items had a modest advantage
compare to the neutral condition. We found a non-lateralized effect of
load with greater alpha for two-cue relative to one-cue condition over
the occipital cortex. This increase was found at the end of the maintenance
period. This finding is congruent with the hypothesis that attention
must first be oriented to the cued items in order to select them.
Once one or two items have been selected, load effects can be observed.
A parametric increase in alpha power with load in occipital cortex has
been previously reported with different stimuli (Jensen, Gelfand,
Kounios, & Lisman, 2002; Scheeringa et al., 2009; Tuladhar et al.,
2007). It has been proposed that load dependent alpha activity is not
likely involved in working memory maintenance per se, but rather reflects
disengagement of the dorsal visual stream (Bonnefond & Jensen,
2012). This inhibition might serve to filter and attenuate irrelevant
visual information in order to prevent interfering signals to sensory
brain regions involved in actual working memory maintenance. There
is a retro-cue study manipulating the number of relevant and irrelevant
items (Manza et al., 2014). These authors found that general alpha
activity increased with relevant load, while they did not observe significant
variations with irrelevant load. In contrast, a WM study using
pre-cues, related the degree of alpha lateralization to the number of
irrelevant items congruent with the gating inhibition hypothesis
(Sauseng, Klimesch, Heise, Gruber, & Holz, 2009). The former study
used bilateral arrays of stimuli, thus is not possible to compare its results
with those from the later. In our study we observed no difference
in lateralization between one-cue and two-cue conditions. If alpha lateralization
were tracking actual WM maintenance, a difference in
alpha lateralization would be expected, with less lateralization for onecue
vs two-cue conditions. However, the alpha inhibition hypothesis
has only been tested between hemispheres but not within the same
hemisphere. Further research is therefore warranted.
A limitation of retro-cue studies using spatial cues, like the one
presented here, is that it is not possible to rule out that alpha lateralization
is indexing allocation of attention to the external hemifield
indicated by the arrow. To control for this confound it would be necessary
to use a non-spatial retro-cue. Retinotopic activation by a nonspatial
retro-cue has been previously found in an fMRI study (Munneke,
Belopolsky, & Theeuwes, 2012) in which a verbal cue referred to one of
the four objects maintained in WM. Further electrophysiological research
will be necessary to reveal how alpha lateralization relates to
retinotopic activation with non-spatial cues.
In conclusion, we found that alpha lateralization arised from two
dissociated neuronal sources that could be related to different neural
mechanisms. We suggest that the initial focal transient alpha desynchronization
might reflect the allocation of selective attention to relevant
items maintained in extrastriate visual regions
(Sadaghiani & Kleinschmidt, 2016). In contrast, a later alpha synchronization
in ipsilateral cortex might be more related to the inhibition of
upcoming information. However, further research manipulating irrelevant
information load is warranted in order to shed light in this later
proposal.
