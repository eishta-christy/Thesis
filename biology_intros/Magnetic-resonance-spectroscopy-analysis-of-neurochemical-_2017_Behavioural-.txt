1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related progressive neurode-
generative disorder accompanied by cognitive decline [1]. The World
Alzheimer Report 2015 estimates that over 46 million people live with
dementia worldwide and the cost of dementia is $818 billion [2].
Furthermore, the prevalence of AD increases with ageing and doubles
every ﬁve years after the age of 65, which will cause great economic
and social burdens [2,3].

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including structural MRI,
functional MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS),
is becoming more useful in the understanding of the pathogenesis and
diagnosis of AD [4–12]. Brain morphological abnormalities, such as
hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala have been gradually
uncovered with the development of structural MRI in the study of AD
patients [4,8,9]. Animal structural MRI also shows striatum and en-
torhinal cortex atrophy in AD models, including the TASTPM and APP/
PS2/Tau mouse [13]. In addition, 1H MRS studies have suggested that
neurochemical alterations, such as those associated with glutamate
(Glu) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the hippocampus or cingulate,
contribute to cognitive decline in AD patients [14–16]. In animal
models of AD, neurochemical alterations were measured similarly with
that of AD patients [17–19]. Glu is a primary excitatory neuro-
transmitter that is thought to represent the number of survival neurons
[20]. NAA is a speciﬁc kind of amino acids that mainly exists in the
neurons and axon [21]. As a neuronal marker, the concentration of

NAA can be sensitive to neuron density. myo-inositol (mIn) is one of the
most abundant metabolites visible on 1H MRS in the brain and can act
as a biomarker of glial activation[22]. A number of studies suggest that
neurochemical alterations are associated with cognitive decline in AD
[18,21,23–25].

However, few studies have contemporarily focused on the roles of
structural MRI changes and neurochemical alterations in cognitive de-
cline associated with AD. Therefore, the current study aimed to mea-
sure the learning and memory ability and regional volumes in APP/PS1
transgenic mice. Furthermore, some atrophic regions were selected as
region of interest (ROI) to explore neurochemical metabolism using 1H
MRS in order to further understand cognitive decline in AD.

<Middle> Materials and methods.
2.1. Animals.
Twelve-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice and age-matched lit-
termate wild-type (C57Bl/6J) control mice were used for the water
maze, MRI and 1H MRS analyses, with 2 diﬀerent groups per test (n = 7
mice/group, weights 25–35 g). APP/PS1 mice express a chimeric
mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a
mutanthuman presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9), which are associated with early-
onset AD [26].

All animals were kept in standard size mouse cages (29*18*13 cm,
up to 5 per same sex group) at 20–26 °C on a daily 12-h light-dark cycle
with ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were per-
formed strictly in accordance with the International Ethical Guidelines
and National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Ethics Committee of
Fujian University of TCM, P.R. China (protocol #FUTCM-2014012). All
eﬀorts were made to minimize animal suﬀering.

2.2. Morris water maze test

Cognitive function was tested using a water maze apparatus
(Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China), which was a stainless
steel circular tank with a diameter of 120 cm and a height of 50 cm. The
tank was ﬁlled with water (21–23 °C) to a depth of 40 cm and divided
into four equal quadrants. A platform (diameter, 6 cm) was placed in
the third quadrant and submerged 1 cm below the surface of the water.
For the place navigation trials, mice were trained for ﬁve days. Each
trial was started by placing the mice in one of the four quadrants. Mice
were allowed to swim for a period of 90 s to ﬁnd the hidden platform. If
a mouse did not ﬁnd the platform within 90 s, it was removed from the
water and placed on the platform for 15 s by a researcher. On the sixth
day, the probe trial test was performed to assess memory consolidation
and the platform was removed. Each mouse was allowed to swim freely
for 90 s. The frequency of each mouse that crossed the position where
the platform was once placed and the time spent in the target quadrant
were recorded.

2.3. MRI scanning

Prior to MRI scanning, mice were initially anaesthetized with 1.5%
isoﬂurane in a 1:4 oxygen and air mixture. During the MRI scan, the
animals were placed prone in a MR-compatible stereotactic holder with
the head cinched, the teeth hooked by a tooth bar, and the nose em-
placed in a nose cone to exhaust isoﬂurane in a mixture of oxygen and
air (ratio 1:4). The core body temperature was controlled to approxi-
mately 37 °C using a warm water circulated heating cradle, and re-
spiration was monitored. Imaging was performed on a 7T small animal
MRI scanner (70/20USR Biospec, Bruker Biospin GMbls, Germany). The
body coil and surface coil were used as the exciting coil and receiving
coil.

A 3D rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) T2-

weigheted sequence was performed to assess anatomic changes with the
following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 16000 ms, echo time
(TE) = 65 ms, number of averages = 16; ﬁeld of view (FOV)
= 20*20 mm,
thickness = 0.2 mm and ma-
trix = 256*256.

slices = 75,

2.4. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of MRI data

All pre-processing was performed using Advanced Normalization
Tools (ANTs) [27] and Statistical Parametric Mapping8 (SPM8, Well-
come Department of Clinical Neurology, London) with the SPMMouse
plugin [28]. First,
the images were corrected for intensity non-
homogeneity with ANTs’s N4biasFieldCorrection [29]. Then, the brain
images were extracted from the corrected images by skull strip. The
extracted brain images were normalized into the standard stereotactic
space [30] and segmented into grey matter (GM), white matter (WM)
and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) using SPMMouse toolbox [28]. Finally,
the resulting GM images were smoothed with a 210 μm isotropic
Gaussian kernel using SPM8. The two-sample t-test was performed by
SPMMouse toolbox [28] voxel-by-voxel to determine the GM volume
diﬀerences within the whole brain between control and APP/PS1
transgenic mice. P < 0.01 and clusters > 50 voxels were considered as
the statistically signiﬁcant threshold.

2.5. 1H-MRS acquiring

Based on the results of the above VBM analysis, APP/PS1 transgenic
mice revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in volume of grey matter in the
hippocampus, motor cortex, amygdaloid body, striatum, etc. The hip-
pocampus is the area of most concern in AD studies. A number of stu-
dies have shown regional atrophy in the hippocampus of AD [8,9].
Therefore, we selected an area in the hippocampus as the region of
interest (ROI) for 1H-MRS measurement, where a signiﬁcant reduction
in volume of grey matter was detected by VBM. The ROI size was set as
1.5*1.5*1.5 mm.

TE = 35 ms,

A T2-weighted image using RARE sequence was ﬁrst acquired to
ensure the mouse head position. The parameters were as follows:
TR = 4200 ms,
averages = 4,
FOV = 20*20 mm, slice thickness = 0.5 mm, slices = 30, and ma-
trix = 256*256. The selected ROI was shimmed, and the water sup-
pression pulse was adjusted for chemical-shift-water suppression
(CHESS) prior to the point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) acquisition.
MR spectroscopic data were collected with
TR = 2500 ms,
TE = 16.168 ms and scan duration = 5 min 20 s.

2.6. 1H-MRS spectral processing

The spectral data were processed using the software package
TOPSPIN (v3.1, Bruker Biospin, Germany). The areas under the peak
for various metabolites, including NAA, mIn, Glu and creatine (Cr),
were calculated automatically using a quantum estimation (QUEST)
method with a subtraction approach for background modelling. Using
Cr as the criterion [18,31], NAA/Cr, Glu/Cr and mIn/Cr were statisti-
cally evaluated. The metabolites chemical shift position in the brain,
including NAA 2.02 parts per million (ppm), Glu 2.2 ppm, mIn 3.5 ppm
and Cr 3.05 ppm.

2.7. Statistical analysis

Both the water maze and 1H MRS data were analysed using SPSS
21.0 software (SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA) with a two-tailed Student’s t-
test, and the results were used to compare APP/PS1 transgenic mice
versus wild type mice. The data were presented as the mean ±
standard error of the mean (S.E.M). P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results.
3.1. Learning and memory declines in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
The Morris water maze experiment was performed to evaluate
learning and memory in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice and the wild type
mice. Both APP/PS1 transgenic mice and wild type mice successfully
learned how to ﬁnd the platform after 4 days of training sessions, and
the escape latency of the two groups was gradually reduced over the 4
training days. However, the escape latency in APP/PS1 transgenic mice
was greater than that of the wild type mice (P < 0.01, Fig. 1A). There
was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in path length between the APP/PS1
transgenic mice and the wild type mice (P > 0.05, Fig. 1B). In the
spatial probe test, the swimming times of the APP/PS1 transgenic mice
in the platform quadrant were signiﬁcantly reduced compared with the
wild type mice (P < 0.01, Fig. 1C–D). The percentage of time spent in
the target quadrant in relation to other quadrants was used for statis-
tical analysis during the probe trial. Both APP/PS1 transgenic mice and
wild type mice spent more time in the target quadrant compared to the
other quadrants (Figure E), whereas the APP/PS1 transgenic mice spent
less time in the target quadrant compared with the wild type mice
(P < 0.01, Figure F).

3.2. The loss of regional volume in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice

VBM was conducted to estimate the volume changes between the
wild type mice and the APP/PS1 transgenic mice using MRI. Compared
to MRI images from the wild type mice, the APP/PS1 transgenic mice
revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in volume of grey matter (P < 0.01,
uncorrected, clusters > 50, Fig. 2). The Paxinos and Franklin’s
coordinates [30] were used to provide detailed visualizations of the
brain regions that presented signiﬁcant loss of signal intensity. The
main signiﬁcant diﬀerences were located in the hippocampus, motor
cortex, amygdaloid body, septal area, accumbens nucleus, bed nucleus
of the stria terminalis and striatum. (Table 1 and Fig. 2).

3.3. Neurochemical changes in hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice

According to the results of the morphology analysis, the hippo-
campus was chosen as the ROI in which 1H MRS was extracted.
Compared to the wild type mice, the ratio of NAA/Cr and Glu/Cr was
decreased in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice, and the ratio of mIn/Cr was
elevated in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice (P < 0.01, Fig. 3). The t
values of NAA/Cr, Glu/Cr and mIn/Cr between the APP/PS1 transgenic
mice and the wild type mice were −4.473, −4.217 and 6.462, and the
p values were 0.001, 0.001 and 0.000, respectively.

<Conclusion> Discussion.
In the present study, we found that the learning and memory ability
of APP/PS1 transgenic mice was decline. VBM analysis showed regional
atrophy of the hippocampus, motor cortex, amygdaloid body, septal
area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and striatum. Furthermore, the
hippocampus was selected as an ROI to explore neurochemical meta-
bolism. The results showed that the ratios of NAA/Cr and Glu/Cr were
decreased, whereas mIn/Cr increased in the hippocampal regions.

T2-weighted images of the APP/PS1 transgenic mice and the wild
type mice were segmented into GM, WM and CSF tissue images. GM is a
major component of the central nervous system and contains numerous
cell bodies. The GM tissue images revealed signiﬁcant atrophy in areas
analogous with those aﬀected in the human brain, such as the cortex
and hippocampus, in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. These results are in
accordance with previous studies that used manual segmentation of
ROI to show a reduction in cortical, hippocampal and striatal volumes
of AD animal models [13]. A number of studies have shown that the
regional atrophy of AD typically appears in the hippocampus, en-
torhinal cortex and amygdaloid nucleus, which are all brain regions
that aﬀect memory, in response to behavioural issues [32]. In the
present study, the Morris water maze test was performed to assess
learning and memory in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The results de-
monstrated that the learning and memory ability of the APP/PS1
transgenic mice declined compared to the wild type mice, which was
accompanied by hippocampal atrophy.

It is becoming increasingly clear that neurochemical alterations in
speciﬁc regions, including Cr, NAA, Glu, and mIn, are correlated with
some behavioural deﬁcits [33]. Previous studies have shown that NAA
level is a positive predictor for functional impairments in diseases
[10,34]. In addition, studies have indicated that Glu levels measured in
the hippocampus by 1H MRS are related to cognitive performance [35].
Several studies have declared that mIn levels are correlated with cog-
nitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease [10,36]. A number of studies have
reported that NAA and Glu were reduced signiﬁcantly in the hippo-
campus in the early stage of AD [17,37]. In vivo 1H MRS studies have
found increased mIn level in the frontal white matter, posterior cin-
gulate region and occipital lobes in AD patients [24,38]. Recently,
Moon et al. performed a study on brain morphometric changes and
metabolic alterations in AD patients [18]. The study reported regional
grey matter atrophy in precuneus, hippocampus, parahippocampal
gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, and found decreased NAA/Cr and in-
creased mIn/Cr in the hippocampus of AD patients. However, the grey
matter atrophy was found in the hippocampus head, while the neuro-
chemical alterations were detected for whole hippocampus Therefore, it
appears more advantageous to assess neurochemical alterations in the
morphometric lesion.

In the present study, the ratios of NAA/Cr and Glu/Cr in the hip-
pocampus were signiﬁcantly decreased in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice,
whereas the ratio of mIn/Cr in the hippocampus was increased. The
atrophy of the hippocampus could be connected with the reduction of
NAA and Glu and might mainly be due to the apoptosis of glutamate
neurons. A number of studies in AD patients have found decreased Glu
levels [14,39], and several studies have reported the utility of mem-
antine in treating AD patients accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase in
Glu levels [39]. In addition, the decrease in NAA and increase in mIn
levels might provide insight into the treatment of AD.

In conclusion, based on the VBM analysis, the present study found

that
the hippocampus, motor cortex, and striatum regions were
atrophic in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Furthermore, a decrease in
NAA and Glu levels, and an increase in mIn levels were found in the
atrophic regions of the hippocampus, which may prove conducive to
the clinical diagnosis of cognitive decline in AD.
