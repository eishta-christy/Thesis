1. Introduction

Public health messages delivered in video format are the mainstay
of smoking-cessation campaigns that have contributed to the decline in
smoking prevalence in the US (Woloshin, Schwartz, & Welch, 2008).
Yet, despite these eﬀorts, smoking remains a leading cause of mortality
and morbidity worldwide, and is responsible for more than 480,000
deaths annually in the United States alone (U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, 2014). Therefore, it is imperative to identify the
factors that inﬂuence audiences’ cognitive processing of smoking-ces-
sation videos (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012).

Sensory features, which attract viewer’s attention through engaging vi-
suals, edits, and music, have been hypothesized to be one such factor
(D’Silva and Palmgreen, 2007; Helme, Donohew, Baier, & Zittleman, 2007;
Morgan, Palmgreen, Stephenson, Hoyle, & Lorch, 2003). Message sensation
value (MSV) is a validated measure that has been developed to quantify
such sensory features in health promotion videos (Morgan et al., 2003). The
prevailing assumption that higher MSV improves cognitive processing and
eﬀectiveness of health promotion videos has been challenged by recent
neuroimaging studies, which found that videos with lower MSV were better
remembered and elicited greater prefrontal and temporal
response
(Langleben et al., 2009; Seelig et al., 2014). These ﬁndings are consistent
with predictions of the limited cognitive capacity theories. These theories
suggest that although high MSV attracts viewers’ attention, it also diverts
cognitive resources from processing the health information content in the
videos (Petty and Cacioppo, 1986; Wilson and Wolf, 2009).

While these studies question the value of utilizing high MSV as an
eﬀective communication tool, they do not address the possibility that
individual diﬀerences in attention to sensory stimulation may be re-
sponsible for the lack of eﬀectiveness of high-MSV videos at a popu-
lation level (Everett and Palmgreen, 1995; Stephenson and Palmgreen,
2001). Such diﬀerences would have been of purely academic interest in
the era of network television, but as media becomes more personalized,
individual diﬀerences in the neurocognitive processing of health pro-
motion videos begin to acquire real life relevance (Chua et al., 2011).
Yet, experimental data on the biological basis of individual diﬀerences
in the cognitive processing of health messages are very limited. Many
key traits that may aﬀect individual ability to process health messages,
such as selective attention, working memory and reward sensitivity, are
inﬂuenced by dopaminergic neurotransmission (Gordon, Devaney,
Bean, & , Vaidya, 2015). The dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) has a
variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism that modulates
dopaminergic neurotransmission, with the 10-repeat (10R) and 9-re-
peat (9R) alleles as the most common forms (Mitchell et al., 2000). The
10R/10R homozygosity has been linked to a higher level of novelty
seeking, a trait that indicates greater reactivity to novel external sti-
mulation (Sabol et al., 1999). The 10R allele has also been consistently
implicated in increased susceptibility to attention deﬁcit disorder
(ADD) (Cook et al., 1995; Gill, Daly, Heron, Hawi, & Fitzgerald, 1997;
Gizer, Ficks, & Waldman, 2009; Kebir, Tabbane, Sengupta, & Joober,
2009; Newman et al., 2014). Although it remains unclear whether this
association is mediated by the dopamine or dopamine transporter levels
(Yang et al., 2007), it suggests that homozygous 10R allele carriers are
more likely than others to exhibit poor attentional processing, e.g.
diﬃculty ﬁltering out irrelevant sensory stimuli, which is a key
symptom of ADD (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Therefore,
it is possible that when exposed to public health video messages with
high MSV, 10R DAT1 homozygotes would be more engaged by the at-
tention-grabbing sensory features compared to carriers of other geno-
types.

The present study sought to examine the eﬀect of DAT1 poly-
morphism on the brain response to high MSV format. The value of such
candidate gene approach is limited by the a priori assumptions about
the relationship between the gene and the phenotype (Tabor,
Risch, & Myers, 2002). However, it remains useful as the practical ap-
proach to generate initial data on the eﬀects of individual genetic
makeup on the neurocognitive processing of public health commu-
nication in a small sample (Simon et al., 2011). Such studies would help
to demonstrate the relevance of genetics to the processing of public
health video ads and to determine the feasibility of the larger and much
more expensive genome-wide association studies. Building on the link
between the 10R DAT1 allele and attentional processing deﬁcits de-
scribed above, we hypothesized that smokers with two copies of the
10R allele (10/10) would diﬀer from smokers without the 10R homo-
zygosity (non-10/10) in the neural response to high-MSV smoking-
cessation videos. Speciﬁcally, we hypothesized that the 10/10 smokers
would show greater neural response to high-MSV vs. low-MSV videos
than the non-10/10 smokers in two brain regions: the right tempor-
oparietal junction (rTPJ) and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
(rVLPFC). These regions form the strongly right lateralized “ventral
attention network” that underlies bottom-up, stimulus-driven atten-
tional processing (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Fox, Corbetta, Snyder,
Vincent, & Raichle, 2006; Petersen and Posner, 2012; Vossel,
Geng, & Fink, 2014), and are thus likely to be modulated by the greater
attention-grabbing sensory content in high-MSV videos. The secondary
aim of the present study was to explore the contribution of the diﬀer-
ences between 10/10 and non-10/10 smokers’ ventral attention net-
work response during one-time exposure to smoking-cessation videos to
individual variation in future smoking behavior. Smoking was indexed
by subjective (self-report) (Gorber, Schofield-Hurwitz, Hardt,
Levasseur, & Tremblay, 2009; Perezstable, Marin, Marin,
Brody, & Benowitz, 1990) and objective (urine levels of the nicotine
metabolite cotinine) measures of smoking (Pokorski, Chen, & Bertholf,
1994; Wall, Johnson, Jacob, & Benowitz, 1988), immediately before
and approximately one month after the one-time exposure to 16
smoking-cessation videos.

<Middle> Materials and methods.
2.1. Participants.
Seventy-four non-treatment-seeking adult daily smokers partici-
pated in the study. Eight participants were excluded due to excessive
(>1 voxel) head motion during the MRI scan and 15 participants de-
clined to be genotyped, leaving 53 participants (23 female; 3 left-
handed) who passed MRI quality control and were genotyped.
Participants reported their racial-ethnic characteristics as follows: 28
White, 19 African American, 4 Asian, and 2 Hispanic. Their ages ranged
between 14.16 ± 0.26 years of education. All participants gave written
informed consent to participate in the protocol approved by the
University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board. Exclusion cri-
teria were (1) presence of any DSM-IV-TR Axis 1 psychiatric disorder
except tobacco use disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2000);
(2) urine drug screen positive for illicit opioids, benzodiazepines, can-
nabinoids, cocaine, or methamphetamine; (3) baseline urinary cotinine
levels <50 ng/ml (SRNT Subcommittee on Biochemical Veriﬁcation,
2002); (4) presence of medical or neurological disorder or treatment
that may aﬀect the cerebrovascular system; and (5) safety-related
contraindications for MRI scanning.

2.2. Task

The video-viewing task is described in the Supplementary materials
and in Wang et al. (2013). Each participant viewed eight smoking-
cessation videos with Low MSV and eight with High MSV in a random
order, separated by a 16 s rest period (gray cross-hair on a homogenous
black background). A 16 s rest period was also presented at the be-
ginning of the task. Each video was 30 s long and presented only once.

2.3. Genotyping

Genomic DNA was extracted from anti-coagulated venous blood
samples using a standard salting out method (Lahiri and Nurnberger,
1991). Genotyping of
the DAT1 40 bp repeat polymorphism
(rs28363170) was performed as previously described (Franklin et al.,
2009; Vandenbergh et al., 1992) (see Supplementary material). Parti-
cipants were divided into two cohorts by the DAT1 genotype: 26
homozygous (two copies) for the 10-repeat allele, and 27 with one or no
10R alleles (21 with 10R/9R, 2 with 9R/8R, and 1 each with 10R/8R,
9R/9R, and 3R/3R).

2.4. Procedure

The study included a phone screening, baseline assessment, fMRI
session, and a follow-up session 1 month later. Participants were asked
to avoid nicotine-replacement products throughout the study and to
report any use of such products. At the baseline session, participants
were evaluated for eligibility, demographics, and handedness (Oldﬁeld,
1971). One hour before the fMRI session, participants provided urine
samples for baseline cotinine levels, reported the average number of
cigarettes smoked per day in the past 30 days, and completed the Fa-
gerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) (Heatherton, Kozlowski,
Frecker, & Fagerstrom, 1991) and other behavioral assessments (see
Supplementary material). Approximately 30–45 min before the fMRI
session, participants were given an opportunity to smoke one of their
own cigarettes outdoors under observation. This minimized individual
diﬀerences in craving for cigarettes during fMRI session, and avoided
this potential confound to the brain response to smoking-cessation vi-
deos. All participants took the opportunity to smoke. Before the video
task began, participants were instructed to attend to the videos. At the
follow-up session approximately 30 days later (M
± SE = 32.08 ± 2.10 d), urine samples for cotinine level were again
obtained. Participants were debriefed about the cotinine assay and the
study hypotheses only after completion of all assessments.
2.5. MRI data acquisition.
MRI imaging was performed using Siemens Tim Trio 3T (Erlangen)
system and a 32-channel receive-only head coil. Blood oxygenation
level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI was performed, using a whole-brain,
single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar sequence with the following
parameters: matrix = 64 × 64, slice thickness/gap = 3.4/0 mm, 32 slices, eﬀective
voxel resolution of 3.4 × 3.4 × 3.4 mm. After BOLD fMRI, 5-min
MPRAGE T1-weighted images were acquired with the following parameters:

TR/TE = 2000/30 ms,

FOV = 220 mm,

126

Z. Shi et al.

Biological Psychology 128 (2017) 125–131

TR/TE = 1630/3.87 ms,


matrix = 256 × 192, eﬀective voxel resolution of 1 × 1 × 1 mm. An
oblique acquisition, oriented along the anterior commissure–posterior
commissure line, allowed coverage of the entire brain with the ex-
ception of the lower cerebellum.
2.6. Functional imaging data analysis

Functional imaging data were analyzed using SPM 8 (Wellcome
Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). Images were adjusted for
slice timing, realigned to the ﬁrst scan to correct for head motion,
normalized into stereotactic Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
space with 3-mm cubic voxels, and spatially smoothed by a Gaussian
ﬁlter with full-width/half-maximum parameter (FWHM) set to 8 mm.
Voxelwise individual-level statistical analyses were performed by
modeling High-MSV and Low-MSV videos using a canonical hemody-
namic response function. Six rigid body motion parameters were in-
cluded as covariates, and the rest periods were treated as the baseline.
The eﬀects of MSV were tested by contrasting High-MSV videos with
Low-MSV videos. To test the diﬀerence in MSV eﬀect between 10/10
and non-10/10 participants, contrast images were subjected to in-
dependent-sample t-tests to examine the eﬀect of DAT1 genotype (10/
10 vs. non-10/10). The MSV eﬀect across all participants was examined
by one-sample t-test and is reported in the Supplementary material as a
replication of a previous study (Wang et al., 2013).

Two key regions of the ventral attention network, the right temporoparietal
junction (rTPJ) and the right ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex (rVLPFC), were tested as a priori regions of interest (ROIs). Based
on a previous meta-analysis (Fox et al., 2006), the rTPJ and rVLPFC
ROIs were deﬁned as 6-radius spheres centered at x/y/z = 59/–47/22
and x/y/z = 41/21/–6 (MNI coordinates converted from Talairach
space (Lancaster et al., 2007). We also conducted a preliminary whole-
brain search for the 10/10 vs non-10/10 group diﬀerences in other
brain regions. We used a common procedure that included a 2000-
iteration Monte-Carlo simulation that determined the combined “voxel-
level p < 0.005” and “cluster size > 52” thresholds required for a
whole-brain corrected p < 0.05. Similar threshold has been shown to
produce a balance in Type I and Type II errors (Lieberman and
Cunningham, 2009). Contrast values of parameter estimates were ex-
tracted from signiﬁcant clusters using MarsBaR 0.42 (http://marsbar.
sourceforge.net) for post hoc correlation and mediation analyses.

2.7. Predictability analysis

We used the leave-one-out cross-validation analysis to test whether
brain response could predict future smoking behavior measured by
cotinine levels at the follow-up session (Hastie, Tibshirani, & Friedman,
2009). We performed a regression analysis on all except one partici-
pant, with follow-up cotinine levels (adjusted for baseline levels) as the
dependent variable, and the brain response as the independent variable.
The parameter estimates obtained from the regression model were then
applied to the omitted participant, yielding a predicted value of his/her
follow-up cotinine level. After repeating this procedure over every
participant, the inaccuracy of prediction was estimated by the mean
squared error (MSE), that is, MSE = [Σi(Ŷ−i − Yi)2]/N, where N is the
number of participants, Yi is the actual follow-up cotinine level for the i-
th participant, and Ŷ−i is the predicted follow-up cotinine level for the
i-th participant based on the regression model with all but the i-th
participant. The signiﬁcance of MSE was determined by a permutation
test. For each of the 10,000 permutations, a random MSE (i.e. MSEnull)
was calculated after permuting the correspondence between follow-up
cotinine levels and brain response. This yielded an empirical distribu-
tion of prediction inaccuracy under the null hypothesis that there was
no association between brain response and follow-up cotinine levels.
The signiﬁcance of the original MSE was then calculated as Prob
(MSE ≥ MSEnull).

2.8. Mediation analysis

To determine whether brain response to MSV in the ventral atten-
tion network mediated eﬀects of DAT1 genotype on cotinine levels at
the follow-up session, we conducted mediation analysis using the
PROCESS macro for SPSS 22 (Model 4; http://www.processmacro.org).
The signiﬁcance of the indirect eﬀect was determined by a 5000-
iteration bootstrapping procedure (Preacher and Hayes, 2004, 2008).
Although the direct and total eﬀects have had less weight in recent
literature, we examined them as well, to better connect with the earlier
literature (Rucker, Preacher, Tormala, & Petty, 2011; Shrout and
Bolger, 2002; Zhao, Lynch, & Chen, 2010). Listwise deletion was used to
manage missing values. This procedure removed ﬁve 10/10 partici-
pants and eight non-10/10 participants leaving a total of 40 partici-
pants in the model. We also used multiple imputations as an alternative
way to manage missing values (Allison, 2001).

3. Results

3.1. Participant characteristics

The demographic characteristics of the 10/10 cohort were: N = 26,
16 females; 2 left-handed; 10 Caucasian, 13 African American, 2 Asian,
1 Hispanic; aged 18–47 years (32.42 ± 1.93); with 13.75 ± 0.41 years
of education. The demographic characteristics of the non-10/10 cohort
were: N = 27, 7 female; 1 left-handed; 18 Caucasian, 6 African
American,
(M
± SE = 31.30 ± 1.84); with 14.56 ± 0.33 years of education. The two
cohorts did not diﬀer in handedness (χ2(1) = 0.40, p = 0.53), race
(χ2(3) = 4.85, p = 0.18), age (t(51) = −0.80, p = 0.43), or years of
education (t(51) = 1.55, p = 0.13). The 10/10 cohort contained sig-
niﬁcantly more female participants than the non-10/10 cohort (χ2(1)
= 6.84, p < 0.01). Behavioral measures including urine cotinine le-
vels, FTND scores, and self-reported cigarettes per day at baseline and
at 30-day follow-up are summarized in Table 1.There was no signiﬁcant
main effect of time of assessment (baseline vs. follow-up) or genotype
(10/10 vs. non-10/10) or interaction (Fs <1.16, ps > 0.29). There was
a trend for positive correlation between follow-up cotinine levels and
self-reported cigarettes per day, after adjusting for baseline (r = 0.31,
p = 0.056).

3.2. fMRI results
Analysis of the a priori ROIs showed that, compared to the non-10/
10 participants, the 10/10 participants showed greater rTPJ response to
the High-MSV vs. Low-MSV smoking-cessation videos (M
± SE= 0.20 ± 0.06 vs. 0.00 ±0.05; t(51) = 2.42, p< 0.02). A trend
in the same direction was found for the rVLPFC (−0.02 ± 0.05 vs.
−0.19 ± 0.07; t(51) = 1.92, p = 0.06). Whole-brain analysis showed
that, compared to the non-10/10 participants, the 10/10 participants
showed greater neural response to High-MSV vs. Low-MSV videos at the
left TPJ (lTPJ), rTPJ, rVLPFC, and right middle temporal gyrus (rMTG)
(see Fig. 1 and Table 2). No regions showed greater MSV effect in the
non-10/10 compared to 10/10 participants. These findings remained
significant after controlling for race and gender (see Supplementary
results).

3.3. Predictability and mediation analysis.
The rTPJ response to the High-MSV vs. Low-MSV videos positively
predicted follow-up urine cotinine levels adjusted for baseline levels
(r = 0.37, p < 0.02) (see Fig. 2A). Leave-one-out cross-validation
confirmed the predictive power of the rTPJ neural response, which
produced significantly smaller MSE compared to that obtained from
randomization (p <0.02) (see Fig. 2B). The rVLPFC response was not
correlated with cotinine levels (r = 0.18, p= 0.26). Similarly, there
was no correlation between the rTPJ response and self-reported cigarettes
per day (r = 0.21, p = 0.18).
Next, we tested the mediation model using DAT1 genotype as the
independent variable (1 = 10/10, −1 =non-10/10), follow-up cotinine
levels as the dependent variable, rTPJ response to High-MSV vs.
Low-MSV videos as the mediator, and baseline cotinine levels as a
covariate. There was a significant indirect effect of DAT1 genotype on
follow-up cotinine levels through the rTPJ neural response (indirect
effect= 146.70, bootstrap SE= 73.17, 95% bootstrap confidence interval
=[36.09, 334.68], p < 0.005). The total and direct effects were
not significant (ps >0.40). Using multiple imputations (20) instead of
listwise deletion produced similar results (ps< 0.05). These findings
remained significant after controlling for race and gender (see
Supplementary results). Substituting urine cotinine levels with cigarettes
per day as the outcome variable yielded a similar mediation effect
(indirect effect= 0.50, bootstrap SE =0.33, 95% bootstrap confidence
interval = [−0.04, 1.30], p =0.07) at a trend level.
<Conclusion> Discussion.
We found that the DAT1 polymorphism modulated smokers’ brain
response to the attention-grabbing sensory features in smoking-cessa-
tion videos. Speciﬁcally, smokers with the 10/10 genotype showed
greater response to the high-MSV vs. low-MSV videos in the rTPJ and
the rVLPFC, whereas the non-10/10 smokers showed the opposite
pattern. The rTPJ and rVLPFC comprise the ventral stream of the
frontoparietal attention network and are mainly involved in bottom-up
attention reorienting toward distinctive extraneous stimuli (Corbetta
and Shulman, 2002; Fox et al., 2006; Petersen and Posner, 2012; Vossel
etal., 2014), both visual and auditory (Downar, Crawley,
Mikulis, & Davis, 2000; Kim, 2014). Hence, our ﬁndings suggest an in-
creased bottom-up attention toward the high-MSV format for the 10/10
participants and vice versa for the non-10/10 participants. This is
consistent with our hypothesis that the DAT1 polymorphism
contributes to individual variability in the cognitive processing of anti-
smoking videos. Nevertheless, since we did not employ direct measures
of attention, future studies would be required to conﬁrm this inter-
pretation.
The ventral attention network, however, does not simply respond to
salient stimuli. Instead, it is modulated by task-relevance, such that its
activity is restricted to important, target stimuli (de Fockert, Rees,
Frith, & Lavie, 2004; Indovina and Macaluso, 2007) or distracters that
share features with the target (Serences et al., 2005). This phenomenon
implies a ﬁltering mechanism of the ventral attention network (espe-
cially the rTPJ) that prevents irrelevant information from being at-
tended to. Failure to suppress the network’s response to distracters may
result in compromised information processing. Therefore, in the present study, the 10/10
participants’ excessive rTPJ response to the high-MSV format might
have impaired their eﬀective processing of the anti-smoking informa-
tion in the videos. Since we did not measure participants’ information
processing eﬃciency directly during the task, this assumption would
require conﬁrmation through additional research. We also showed that
neural activity of the rTPJ predicted urine cotinine levels approxi-
mately one month after exposure to the videos. Speciﬁcally, the rTPJ
response to the high-MSV vs. low-MSV videos was positively correlated
with future smoking and mediated the eﬀect of genotype on that be-
havior. These ﬁndings suggest that greater rTPJ response to the high-
MSV format is associated with poorer long-term behavioral respon-
siveness to smoking-cessation messaging. A possible explanation could
be that the 10/10 individuals developed a less adaptive processing style
that focused on the sensory features of the videos, and thus received less
beneﬁt from the anti-smoking information (Langleben et al., 2009;
Seelig et al., 2014).

Together, our ﬁndings contribute to the existing literature in several
ways. First, they extend prior studies on the mechanisms of neurocog-
nitive processing of the high-MSV format (Langleben et al., 2009; Seelig
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013) to genetic variability, i.e. the DAT1
polymorphism. Second, previous studies have shown that neural ac-
tivity of the self-referential processing regions, such as the medial
prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, predict
the behavioral outcomes of health communication (Chua et al., 2011;
Falk, Berkman, Mann, Harrison, & Lieberman, 2010; Wang et al., 2013).
Here, we expand these ﬁndings by showing that the diﬀerential en-
gagement of the attention network (e.g. rTPJ) in response to video
format is an additional outcome predictor. Third, the 10R DAT1 allele is
associated with high risk for ADD (Cook et al., 1995; Gill et al., 1997;
Gizer et al., 2009; Kebir et al., 2009; Newman et al., 2014), addiction
(Stolf et al., 2014) and poorer outcomes of smoking-cessation treatment
(Lerman Stapleton, Sutherland, & O’Gara, 2007). The present study adds a neurobiological
dimension to this literature by showing that 10/10 smokers may have
less eﬀective cognitive processing of smoking-cessation videos and may
derive less beneﬁt from population-level public health interventions
than other smokers.

Findings for the self-reported cigarettes per day were at a trend level
and in the same direction as urine cotinine. This is in agreement with
prior literature suggesting that self-report is less sensitive to individual
diﬀerences in response to smoking-cessation videos than urine cotinine
(Gorber et al., 2009; Perezstable et al., 1990; Pokorski et al., 1994; Wall
et al., 1988). The relationship between biological and self-report mea-
sures in addiction research is often indirect, with both over- and under-
estimation of addiction severity depending on context (de Beaurepaire
et al., 2007; Devine et al., 2013). For this reason, laboratory con-
ﬁrmation of self-report by urine analysis is the standard of practice in
substance abuse treatment. The number of cigarettes smoked per day is
only a rough approximation of the amount of nicotine actually inhaled
and then absorbed and metabolized, as the inhaled volume and the
portion of a cigarette actually consumed varies widely within and be-
tween participants. Cotinine levels are a more reliable and objective
measure of
the eﬀective amount of nicotine active in the body
(Benowitz et al., 2009) and also have predictive value in cancer re-
search (Zhu et al., 2013). Therefore, it is not surprising that the neural
response to smoking-cessation videos was a better predictor of urine
cotinine levels that of self-reported smoking behavior.

Our ﬁndings inform the neurocognitive mechanisms of anti-smoking
communication processing among smokers with DAT1 10/10 and non-
10/10 genotypes. Although using the genotype to personalize health
communications (Wang et al., 2016) may not be feasible in the fore-
seeable future, we believe that these ﬁndings may help inform future
development of anti-smoking communication strategies, so that “less
responsive” smokers (in this case DAT1 10/10 homozygotes) beneﬁt
from anti-smoking ads as much as other smokers. Speciﬁcally, the re-
duced eﬀectiveness of high-MSV videos in imparting health information
to the 10/10 smokers suggests that it may be challenging to produce
videos that would attract the 10/10 smokers’ attention without dis-
tracting them from the message content. One option is to use lower
MSV videos. However, this approach may fail to attract the 10/10
smokers’ attention altogether (Morgan et al., 2003). Another option is
to strengthen the ads’ content to help them survive the distraction of
high MSV in this population. This could be achieved by including anti-
smoking arguments that have been independently rated as more per-
suasive (Zhao, Strasser, Cappella, Lerman, & Fishbein, 2011). Previous
research showed that high-MSV video messages were better re-
membered than low-MSV ones only when the ads’ argument strength
was high (Wang et al., 2013). Although the sample size of the present
study does not permit testing the three-way interaction of DAT1 gen-
otype, MSV and argument strength, determining whether increasing
argument strength could attenuate the detrimental eﬀect of high MSV
on the eﬀectiveness of smoking-cessation videos among 10/10 smokers
is a worthwhile subject of future research.

Our study comes with a number of limitations. Although we were
interested in the attentional processing of the smoking-cessation videos,
we did not directly measure attention during video viewing. This lim-
ited our ability to infer psychological functions from the observed brain
responses. It would be interesting to address this issue by incorporating
measures such as eye-tracking for each video in the future studies
(Nardo, Santangelo, & Macaluso, 2011). We focused on a single poly-
morphism in a limited sample of smokers. However, neurocognitive
endophenotypes may be largely polygenic, exhibiting additive eﬀects
from multiple genetic variants. Other genes commonly
associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission include COMT and the
dopamine receptor genes DRD2 and DRD4 (Frank, Moustafa, Haughey,
Curran, & Hutchison, 2007). Studies support a potential role for DRD2
and DRD4, but not COMT in attention processing (Barnett,
Scoriels, & Munafo, 2008; Cheuk and Wong, 2006; Gizer et al., 2009;
Sun, Yuan, Shen, Xiong, & Wu, 2014). Despite the known limitations of
the single candidate gene approach, our ﬁndings set the stage for fur-
ther research examining a more comprehensive set of candidate genes
or genome-wide association (Tabor et al., 2002) that would provide a
more complete picture of the neural and genetic eﬀects of cessation
videos on smoking (Falcone et al., 2013). Additionally, given the
greater risk of Type I error with small sample sizes, our ﬁndings will
need to be replicated in an independent cohort with a larger sample
size. We did not include control videos (i.e. videos not promoting
smoking cessation) or control subjects (i.e. non-smokers). Therefore,
our ﬁndings may not be speciﬁc to smoking-cessation videos. However,
even if our ﬁndings reﬂect viewers’ capacity to process persuasive video
advertising in general, their potential relevance to smoking-cessation
communications remains. Future studies could evaluate the interaction
between genotype and smoking status (current, former and at-risk) on
both health and other messages. In addition, although our ﬁndings were
unchanged after controlling for gender, it should be noted that there are
substantial gender diﬀerences in the rates of response to nicotine re-
placement therapy (Wetter et al., 1999) and in susceptibility to anti-
smoking communications (Toll et al., 2008). Lastly, given the liberal
threshold we used for the exploratory whole-brain analysis, the neural
response of the non-a priori clusters (i.e. the lTPJ and rMTG) should be
interpreted with caution (Eklund, Nichols, & Knutsson, 2016).

5. Conclusions

DAT1 genotype signiﬁcantly contributes to the individual varia-
bility in brain response to the level of sensory stimulation by smoking-
cessation videos, which in turn predicts future smoking behavior.
Genetic variability should be taken into account in future studies of the
brain processing of health communications. These ﬁndings may help
inform future eﬀorts in identifying message characteristics that can
better reach smokers who may be less responsive to mass-media public
health campaigns.
