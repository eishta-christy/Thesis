1. Introduction

Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) is a common
neurodevelopmental disorder with a worldwide prevalence around
5.3% (Polanczyk, de Lima, Horta, Biederman, & Rohde, 2007). The
electroencephalogram (EEG), as a non-invasive tool to measure brain
electrical activity, has been used frequently in research to objectively
reﬂect the abnormalities of AD/HD (Barry, Clarke, & Johnstone, 2003).
Past studies have reported that patients with AD/HD showed increased
slow-wave activity and reduced fast-wave activity compared to healthy
controls, which results in a higher slow/fast wave ratio − commonly
measured as an elevated theta/beta ratio (TBR) (Barry & Clarke, 2009).
An early meta-analysis demonstrated a large eﬀect size for the AD/HD-
control group diﬀerence on TBR (Snyder & Hall, 2006). In 2013, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2013) approved the use of TBR to
assist in the identiﬁcation and diagnosis of AD/HD.

However, the diagnostic value of TBR in AD/HD is controversial as
recent studies have failed to replicate the group diﬀerence reported in
earlier studies (Arns, Conners, & Kraemer, 2013; Loo et al., 2013;
Ogrim, Kropotov, & Hestad, 2012; Zhang et al., in press). Instead, re-
searchers are proposing the use of TBR in AD/HD for a prognostic
purpose (Arns et al., 2013; Lenartowicz & Loo, 2014; Zhang et al., in
press). The prognostic proposition focusses on using EEG to predict
individual diﬀerences in AD/HD rather than identifying the char-
acteristics of AD/HD. From this perspective, while TBR does not re-
liably diﬀerentiate the patients from healthy controls, patients with
elevated TBR show features diﬀering from those without elevated TBR.
The argument is supported by the heterogeneous nature of TBR in AD/
HD − about 35% of patients are estimated to have elevated TBR
(Clarke et al., 2011). In addition, the prognostic value is also supported
by EEG-based medication studies in which patients with higher TBR
responded better to stimulant treatment (Arns, 2012; Clarke, Barry,
McCarthy, & Selikowitz, 2002).

One obstacle to using TBR for its prognostic value is to understand
its behavioral meaning. The aberrant EEG activity in AD/HD was at-
tributed to an arousal disorder in a prevailing EEG model of AD/HD, the
hypo-arousal model (Satterﬁeld & Cantwell, 1974; Mann et al., 1992).
In this model, the higher TBR in AD/HD was thought to reﬂect lower
arousal compared to healthy controls. However, the assumption was
not supported in a study that did not ﬁnd the relationship between TBR
and arousal in children with AD/HD (Barry, Clarke, Johnstone,
McCarthy, & Selikowitz, 2009). Instead, it was suggested that TBR in
AD/HD may provide information about cognitive processing (Barry
et al., 2009). However, it is uncertain which speciﬁc tasks/processes are
related to TBR. In subsequent studies, it was reported that inattentive
symptoms correlated with fronto-central TBR in children with AD/HD
(Loo et al., 2013; Zhang et al., in press). Patients with higher TBR
showed more severe inattentive issues (Loo et al., 2013; Zhang et al., in
press). These results suggest that TBR may be a marker of attentional
processing, which is consistent with studies of TBR in the normal po-
pulation (Angelidis, van der Does, Schakel, & Putman, 2016; Putman,
van Peer, Maimari, & van der Werﬀ, 2010; Putman, Verkuil, Arias-
Garcia, Pantazi, & van Schie 2014).

In the normal population, Putman et al. (2010) explored the re-
lationship between frontal TBR and inhibitory functions. Inhibition was
conceptualized at an attentional level (attention control, also known as
interference control) and at a response level (response inhibition). The
study revealed negative correlations between TBR and inhibition at two
levels, relationships that were further replicated in subsequent studies
(e.g. Putman et al., 2014; Angelidis et al., 2016). In these studies, the
participants with higher TBR performed worse on inhibitions involving
attentional and response control. As a result, TBR was considered a
biomarker for inhibition (Angelidis et al., 2016; Putman et al., 2014).
These results suggest that children with AD/HD who have elevated
frontal TBR may be in risk of inhibitory deﬁcits both at attentional and
at response level. Following this explanation, the correlation between
TBR and the inattention found in AD/HD research (Loo et al., 2013;
Zhang et al., in press) may essentially reﬂect a weakness of attentional/
interference and response control. However, these assumptions have
not been empirically addressed.

Therefore, the current study aimed to explore whether elevated TBR
is related to deﬁcient inhibition in children with AD/HD. As inhibition
is a broad concept (Nigg, 2000; Diamond, 2013), three types of in-
hibition found to be deﬁcient in AD/HD were examined; interference
control (IC), response inhibition (RI), and daily inhibition (DI). The ﬁrst
two terms are similar to those used in Putman et al. (2010). IC is a
higher-order function of attention and plays an important role in top-
down regulation, allowing individuals to preferentially process relevant
stimuli and ignore irrelevant stimuli (Petersen and Posner, 2012). In
comparison to healthy controls, patients with AD/HD show poor per-
formance in IC tasks (Mullane, Corkum, Klein, & McLaughlin, 2009)
and diﬀer from controls on electrophysiological measures taken during
task performance (Johnstone, Barry, Markovska, Dimoska, & Clarke,
2009; Johnstone, Barry, & Clarke 2013). In the laboratory, IC is fre-
quently measured via a Flanker task.

RI refers to the ability to stop an inappropriate prepotent or ongoing
movement (Aron, Robbins, & Poldrack, 2004). A substantial proportion
of the AD/HD population show deﬁcits in RI (Willcutt, Doyle, Nigg,
Faraone, & Pennington, 2005), and concurrent abnormal neural activity
has been shown in electrophysiological (Dimoska,Johnstone,
Barry, & Clarke, 2003; Johnstone et al., 2013) and neuroimaging stu-
dies (Aron & Poldrack, 2005). The Stop-signal task is frequently used to
measure RI.
DI also measures the ability to control/stop inappropriate behaviors
but the measurement is based on performance in daily life (Gioia,
Isquith, Guy, & Kenworthy, 2000). While RI is usually measured by
experimental computerized tasks, performance indices may only reﬂect
pure inhibitory processes without the involvement of emotion and
motivation, which is dissimilar to daily behaviors (Barkley & Fischer,
2011; Barkley, 2013). Thus, the outcomes may lack ecological validity
(Barkley, 2013). Here, DI is introduced to measure inhibition in a social
context, and measurement is typically via observation/questionnaires.
Past studies have reported that, compared to controls, children with
AD/HD show poor inhibitory control as measured by DI
(Barkley & Fischer, 2011; McAuley, Chen, Goos, Schachar, & Crosbie,
2010).

As variables such as TBR are quantitative in nature, proportion/
median-based split is widely used to dichotomize continuous variables
into categorical variables (DeCoster, Iselin, & Gallucci, 2009;
MacCallum, Zhang, Preacher, & Rucker, 2002); for example see Barry
et al. (2009). The transformation allows researchers to better examine
experimental hypotheses (Decoster et al., 2009; Iacobucci, Posavac,
Kardes, Schneider, & Popovich, 2015). However, a common concern is
that the dichotomization may bias the results, and certain justiﬁcations
should be given when using the method (Decoster et al., 2009; Iacbucci
et al., 2015; MacCallum et al., 2002). One consideration is whether
there is a theoretical justiﬁcation for the cut point (Decoster et al.,
2009). In an AD/HD population, not all patients show elevated TBR
(Arns et al., 2013); 35% of the patients are estimated to have elevated
TBR compared to healthy controls (Clarke et al., 2011). Therefore 35%
will be the cut point to categorize an elevated TBR group or a control
group here.

The current study will explore whether AD/HD patients with or
without high frontal TBR are diﬀerentiated on three inhibitory mea-
sures − IC, RI, and DI. We predict that patients with elevated TBR will
perform worse on these inhibitory assessments.

<Middle> Methods.
2.1. Participants.
The participants were recruited at child psychiatric clinics of Peking
University Sixth Hospital. Clinical Diagnostic Interview Scale (CDIS), a
structured clinical interview based on the DSM-IV, was conducted by
psychiatrists with the participants and their parents. Diagnosis was
made by a senior psychiatrist based on clinical observation and the
results of the CDIS. The mandarin version of CDIS was used and it
shows good sensitivity and speciﬁcity (Yang, Wang, Qian,
Biederman, & Faraone, 2004). Fifty-eight children (49 males, age range
8–13 years, M = 10.2, SD = 1.5 years) participated in this study.
Thirty four children were diagnosed with the predominantly inattentive
type (ADHD-I) and 1 of these was comorbid with Oppositional Deﬁant
Disorder (ODD). Twenty four children were diagnosed with the com-
bined type (ADHD-C); four of them were comorbid with ODD and 1 was
comorbid with Tic disorder. All participants had: 1) screening by the
Clinical Diagnostic Interviewing Scales (Barkley, 1998); 2) no history of
head trauma with loss of consciousness; 3) no history of other severe
disease; 4) no history of pharmacological treatment; and 5) an IQ
higher than 80 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale III for children.

2.2. Procedure

Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Wollongong
Human Research Ethics Committee (HE 15/085). Informed consent was
obtained from the parent or guardian of each participant prior to ac-
cessing any records or testing.
Participants were required to complete the testing protocol in one
day. In the morning, participants were in a patient room accompanied
by a psychiatrist. They completed psychometric assessments and the
Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) over
about 2 h. In the afternoon, resting EEG was recorded in a room which
was free from distraction, with participants seated on a comfortable
chair with dimmed lighting. After EEG recording, participants were
required to complete a Flanker task. The afternoon tasks lasted about
55 min.
2.3. Inhibitory measures

IC was measured by the Flanker task (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974)
programmed using E-prime (Psychological Software Tools, Pittsburgh,
PA). The task stimuli and parameters followed Johnstone et al. (2009).
There were three trial types: congruent, incongruent , and
neutral; with 40 presentations of
each trial type. Each trial began with a 500 ms central ﬁxation cross
(+) immediately followed by a stimulus which remained on-screen
until a response was made or for 1500 ms if no response was made. A
blank followed, of random duration between 250 and 750 ms. Children
were instructed to focus on the ﬁxation, ignore the ﬂanking stimuli
surrounding the central arrow, and respond with a left or right button
press according to the direction of the central arrow. Only the ﬁrst
response was recorded. Correct reaction time on incongruent stimuli
(RTincongruent) minus correct reaction time on neutral stimuli (RTneutral)
was calculated to measure the interference response cost (IRC).

RI was measured by the Stop-signal task embedded in CANTAB.
CANTAB is a commercial computerized battery consisting of a range of
neuropsychological tasks (Chamberlain et al., 2011). Only the results of
the Stop-signal task are reported in this study. In this task, children
were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to bidirectional ar-
rows. The task consisted of 320 trials with a 1000 ms inter-trial interval.
In a minority of trials (25%) when an arrow was followed by an audi-
tory signal, they were instructed to withhold their response. The Stop-
signal task used a staircase design with the stop-signal delay (SSD)
varied with a 50 ms step based on task performance, typically resulted
in a 50% success on stop-signal trials. The outcome was stop-signal
reaction time (SSRT), an estimate of the time taken to inhibit the re-
sponse. SSRT was calculated by subtracting the SSD50% (at which the
participant has 50% success in stopping) from the median RT of correct
Go trials (Go RT).

DI was measured by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive
Function (BRIEF). The BRIEF is an 86-item questionnaire for assessing
executive functions by observing daily behaviors, consisting of non-
overlapping clinical subscales (Gioia et al., 2000). The BRIEF-Parent
edition was used, and only the score of the inhibitory subscale is re-
ported, given the stated research purpose.

2.4. EEG recording and pre-processing

Five minutes of EEG were recorded in an eyes-closed resting con-
dition, followed by 5-min of recording with eyes open. The eyes-closed
data were used in this study. The recording was paused if children
showed signs of fatigue or restlessness. The EEG was acquired via a 128-
channel system (HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net, Electrical Geodesics,
Inc., Eugene, OR). The impedance of all electrodes was less than 50 kΩ.
All electrodes were physically referenced to Cz (ﬁxed by the EGI
system). The EEG was ampliﬁed with a band pass of 0.01–200 Hz,
which was digitized on-line at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The EGI data
were converted to allow analysis using EEGLAB and Neuroscan soft-
ware version 4.3.

The EEG pre-processing followed previous studies in AD/HD (Barry
et al., 2009; Clarke et al., 2011). Nineteen channels were selected based
on the international 10–20 system. All channels were oﬄine re-refer-
enced to linked ears, and re-sampled at 256 Hz, ﬁltered by a band-pass
ﬁlter from 1 Hz to 70 Hz and a 50 Hz notch ﬁlter. Visual inspection was
used to identify and exclude sections of EEG trace containing gross
artefacts. The Independent Component Analysis function in EEGLAB
(Delorme & Makeig, 2004) was applied on the 19 channels to identify
and exclude components related to eye and muscle movements; this is a
semi-automatic process aided by a tool box in EEGLAB, ADJUST
(Mognon, Jovicich, Bruzzone, & Buiatti, 2011). Then, a 3-min period
was extracted from the artefact-free EEG data, and was segmented into
4 s epochs. These epochs were Fourier transformed using a Hamming
window. Then EEG band power was obtained for two frequency bands:
theta (3.5-7.5 Hz) and beta (12.5–25 Hz). TBR was subsequently cal-
culated.

2.5. Statistical analysis

Frontal TBR was calculated by averaging the TBR values of frontal
electrodes (Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F7, F8, Fz). Then, participants were di-
vided into an elevated TBR group (ET, the value of TBR ranked top
35%) and a control TBR group (CT).

A common feature of the patients who have elevated TBR is the
globally increased ratio (Clarke et al., 2011). To examine whether the
ET group had this feature, a topographic analysis was conducted. The
electrodes were divided into nine regions: left frontal (Fp1, F3, F7),
midline frontal (Fz), right frontal (Fp2, F4, F8), left central (T3, C3),
midline central (Cz), right central (T4, C4), left posterior (T5, P3, O1),
midline posterior (Pz) and right posterior (T6, P4, O2). The EEG data
for each region were calculated by averaging the electrodes in the re-
gion. Then, an ANOVA with between-subjects factors of Group (ET, CT)
and within-subjects topographic factors of Lateral (left, midline, right)
and Sagittal (frontal, central, posterior) was conducted for the theta/
beta ratio. Planned contrasts were examined within the Sagittal and
Lateral factors. Within the Sagittal factor, planned contrasts compared
the frontal (F) and posterior regions (P), and the central region (C) with
the mean of the frontal and posterior regions (F/P). Within the Lateral
factor, the contrasts compared the left hemisphere (L) with the right
(R), and the midline region (M) with the mean of the hemispheres (L/
R). The contrasts were planned, and there were no more of them than
the degrees of freedom for the eﬀect, so no Bonferroni-type adjustment
to α was required (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007).

ANOVA was separately used to examine the primary measures de-
rived from the Stop-signal task and the Flanker task between groups. To
examine the eﬀect of Group on inhibitory measures, a MANOVA was
conducted. Pillai’s Trace tests were conducted. The behavioral data
were inspected before entering the analysis. For RT-based measures,
data were considered an outlier if it exceeded ± 2.5 standard deviations
from the mean. One case was screened out in the Flanker task. For DL, 3
cases were screened out as the scores exceed the criterion of the
questionnaire. As these values were missing at random, an ex-
pectation–maximization method was used to estimate the missing va-
lues.

3. Results
3.1. Demographic and diagnostic information

Demographic and diagnostic information were compared between
groups (See Table 1). No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between the
ET group and the CT group for age, IQ, and scores on the AD/HD Rating
Scales.

3.2. TBR topographic analysis

The topographic maps for TBR for each Group are displayed in
Fig. 1. TBR was larger in the midline (11.9) than the mean of the left/
right hemispheres (8.6)
(M > L/R: F(1,56) = 49.58, p < 0.001,
2 = 0.470), larger in the frontal (10.3) than posterior (8.2) region
ηp
(F > P: F(1,56) = 43.03, p < 0.001,
), and larger in the
central (10.5) than frontal/posterior (9.3) region (C > F/P: F(1,56)
2 = 0.104), and thus showed a midline fronto-
= 6.52, p = 0.013, ηp
central distribution.

A Group × Lateral

ment was larger in the ET (4.9) than CT (1.8) group. A Group × Sagittal
2 = 0.068)
interaction (ET > CT × F > P: F(1,56) = 4.07, p = 0.049, ηp
indicated that the frontal enhancement was larger in the ET (2.7) than
CT (1.4) group. Also, a main eﬀect of Group (ET > CT: F(1,56)
2 = 0.407) indicated that the ET (12.9) had a
= 38.49, p < 0.001, ηp
globally elevated TBR compared to the CT (6.4).

4.1. Task performance

For the stop-signal task, the mean proportion of successful stop trials
was 48.7% across participants, indicating the varied method in SST was
valid. Separate ANOVAs examined Go RT and mean SSD50% between
the groups (Table 2). There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences.

For the Flanker task, RTincongruent was greater than RTneutral (F
2 0.762), indicating that the ﬂanker
(1,57) = 182.59, p < 0.001, =ηp
setting was valid. Separate ANOVAs examined the mean RTs on neutral
and incongruent trials between the groups (Table 2). The ET group
showed a larger RTincongruent compared with the CT group (F(1,56)
= 5.31, p = 0.025, ηp

2 = 0.087).

4.2. Inhibitory functions

The results of inhibitory tasks are displayed in Table 2. There was a
signiﬁcant eﬀect of Group on IRC, SSRT, and DI in Pillai’s Trace (F
2 0.192). Separate univariate ANOVAs
=ηp
(3,54) = 4.29, p = 0.009,
were then conducted on each measure. IRC was larger in the ET than CT
2 = 0.088). By contrast,
group (ET > CT: F(1,56) = 5.42, p = 0.024, ηp
DI was smaller in the ET than CT group (EC < CT: F(1,56) = 5.69,
2 = 0.092). There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence on SSRT (F
p = 0.020, ηp
(1,56) = 0.29, p = 0.590, ηp

2 = 0.005).

As the ET group showed larger IRC and smaller DI, one-way Pearson
correlations were conducted to examine if the relationships between
TBR and each of these types of inhibition were continuous. The corre-
lations with TBR were signiﬁcant (IRC: r = 0.219, N = 58, p = 0.049;
DI: r = −0.227, N = 58, p = 0.043).

In summary, the results revealed that compared to the CT group, the
ET group was more inﬂuenced by the interference but had less in-
hibitory issues in a social context. Also, the relationships between TBR
and the inhibition types were continuous.

4.3. Relationships among inhibitory functions in each group

As diﬀerences between groups were evident for inhibitory functions,
relationships between the inhibitory tasks were further explored in the
ET and CT groups separately. No signiﬁcant correlations were found
between the DI and other inhibitory functions in the ET (DI with IRC,
r = 0.130, N = 20, p = 0.655; DI with SSRT, r = −0.291, N = 20,
p = 0.213) and CT group (DI with IRC, r = 0.286, N = 38, p = 0.082;
DI with SSRT, r = 0.170, N = 38, p = 0.307). However, diﬀerent re-
lationships between IRC and SSRT were found between groups. IRC was
signiﬁcantly correlated to SSRT (r = 0.322, N = 38, p = 0.048) in the
CT group, whereas this correlation was not signiﬁcant in the ET group
(r = 0.135, N = 20, p = 0.570). By using a Fisher transformation, the
correlations between SSRT and IRC were compared between the ET
(r = 0.135, N = 20) and the CT group (r = 0.322, N = 38). The dif-
ference was not signiﬁcant (p = 0.503).

<Conclusion> Discussion.

TBR is increasingly important as a prognostic biomarker in AD/HD
research (Arns et al., 2013), although the behavioral meaning of TBR is
currently uncertain. It has been suggested that TBR is related to
cognitive processes rather than hypo-arousal in the AD/HD population
(Barry et al., 2009). In addition, recent studies in healthy populations
show that TBR is negatively correlated with inhibitory functions
(Angelidis et al., 2016; Putman et al., 2010; 2014). Hence, the current
study classiﬁed an elevated TBR group, based on the proportion of the
population estimated to include this feature, as indicated by cluster
analysis (Clarke et al., 2011), and explored whether the patients with
elevated TBR displayed weakness in three types of inhibitory tasks.

Across the groups TBR had a fronto-central distribution, which is
consistent with previous studies (Barry & Clarke, 2009; Clarke, Barry,
McCarthy, & Selikowitz, 2001). Compared to the CT group, the ET
group showed a globally increased TBR. The result is in line with a
feature in children with AD/HD who have excessive TBR (Clarke et al.,
2011).

With regard to the inhibitory functions, the current study found that
participants in the ET group were more inﬂuenced by interference
compared to the CT group; the ET group took longer to make an ac-
curate response when interference stimuli were present. This result
supports the hypothesis and is consistent with ﬁndings in the normal
population. Using a self-report scale to measure IC, Putman et al.
(2010) reported that the value of TBR is negatively correlated with
performance. This ﬁnding was also repeated in subsequent studies and
has shown good test-retest reliability (Angelidis et al., 2016; Putman
et al., 2014).

The ﬁndings of the relationships on RI and DI are in contrast to the
hypotheses. In the Putman et al. (2010) study, TBR was also negatively
correlated to RI; however, there was a non-signiﬁcant diﬀerence of RI
between groups in this study. The diﬀering results may be due to dif-
ferences in the stimuli and task paradigms. In their study, emotional
stimuli were selected to investigate the relationship between TBR and
emotional processing encouraged by previous ﬁndings (Knyazev,
2007). Thus, the outcome reﬂects an interaction between emotional
processing and RI. Here, without engaging emotional processes, the
outcomes reﬂect more pure RI processing. Furthermore, with diﬀerent
paradigms adopted, diﬀerent aspects of RI were involved. A Go/Nogo
task was used in their study while a Stop-signal task was used here.
Although both tasks measure RI, the Go/Nogo task emphasizes the
ability to inhibit a response tendency whereas the Stop-signal task
emphasizes the ability to inhibit an ongoing response (Aron, 2011;
Verbruggen & Logan, 2008). The two paradigms are thought to elicit
diﬀerent types of response inhibition (Verbruggen & Logan, 2008) and
diﬀerent brain regions are involved in the tasks (Aron, 2011). Hence,
the non-signiﬁcant result here indicates that there is no diﬀerence in
inhibiting an ongoing response between groups.

Also, the direction of the diﬀerence between groups on DI − pa-
tients with elevated TBR had better performance on an inhibitory score
measured by BRIEF − is contradictory to expectations. The contra-
diction is relevant to a debate on the relationship between executive
functions (EF) outcomes, including inhibition, measured by computer
tasks, and the outcomes measured by reports based on daily perfor-
mance (Barkley, 2013). Although EFs are operationally deﬁned in si-
milar ways in these two approaches, low or no correlations have been
reported between the outcomes from EF tasks and those from EF
questionnaires in both normal (McAuley et al., 2010) and AD/HD po-
pulations
Bucciarelli,
Jain, & Tannock, 2009). Two reasons may account for the disassocia-
tion. First, the outcome measured by computerized tasks reﬂects the
pure EF without a motivational or emotional inﬂuence; so-called “cold
EF” (Barkley, 2013; Diamond, 2013). On the other hand, EF ques-
tionnaires measure day-to-day activities in which motivational and/or
emotional factors play an important role; so-called “hot EF” (Barkley,
2013; Diamond, 2013). Thus, the diﬀerence may result from the in-
volvement of motivational and/or emotional factors.
The second explanation for the dissociation between task-based and
questionnaire measures of EF, and the one that seems more plausible
for the data reported here, is that the questionnaire-based approach
may actually measure abilities other than EFs (McAuley et al., 2010).
Fast and slow brain rhythms are resourced from diﬀerent brain systems
and play cooperative roles in regulating behavior (for a historical re-
view, see Knyazev, 2007). In detail, the fast wave/slow wave ratio such
as TBR is suggested to reﬂect emotional and (or) motivational proces-
sing. For example, the TBR is related to more motivational imbalances
and punishment-driven behaviors (Schutter & Van Honk, 2005). Also,
healthy individuals with higher TBR show weakness in inhibiting a
response under the eﬀect of emotion (Putman et al., 2010). In this way,
patients with higher TBR should have performed worse on BRIEF in this
study. Moreover, scores on BRIEF are widely related to math perfor-
mance, reading proﬁciency, and other behaviors but not related to
classic EF tasks including inhibitory tasks in children (McAuley et al.,
2010), which suggests BRIEF may actually measure other abilities.
Hence, the comparison of the inhibitory subscale between groups may
in fact tap abilities other than inhibition. Our results suggest that
children with AD/HD who do not show elevated TBR may have atypical
functions in other domains rather than inhibition.
Furthermore, diﬀerent relationships between IC and RI were found
between groups − IC was correlated with RI in the CT but not ET
group. The diﬀerence may reﬂect the smaller group size of the ET
group, as the comparison of the correlations was not signiﬁcant.
Otherwise, this may indicate that IC and RI are separate functions in the
ET group. In the normal population, behavioral studies ﬁnd that IC and
RI share some variance (Friedman & Miyake, 2004; Huizinga,
Dolan, & van der Molen, 2006), and imaging studies reveal some pre-
frontal areas that play an important role in both inhibitory functions
(Bunge, Dudukovic, Thomason, Vaidya, & Gabrieli, 2002; Nee,
Wager, & Jonides, 2007; Wager et al., 2005). Moreover, compared to
adults, children tend to show less activation of these common areas
(Bunge et al., 2002). Together, the disassociation may indicate that
children in the ET group may have the immature pre-frontal regions
which are common neural underpinnings for inhibitory functions.
The current results have implications for the use of TBR as a prog-
nostic biomarker in children with AD/HD. Elevated TBR was thought of
as a reliable marker for classifying AD/HD from healthy controls
(Snyder & Hall, 2006). However, recent evidence shows that the dif-
ference between the groups is reducing (Arns et al., 2013) and not all
children with AD/HD can be characterized by increased TBR (Clarke
et al., 2011). In this case, the prognostic value of TBR was proposed in
AD/HD (Arns et al., 2013; Lenartowicz & Loo, 2014). A hot topic related
to the TBR research is its behavioral meaning (Barry et al., 2009). An
inference from current limited studies is that TBR in AD/HD may be
indicative of issues in attentional processing (Loo et al., 2013; Zhang
et al., in press) without further specifying which exact types of atten-
tional functions are involved. Our results extend the ﬁndings to in-
hibition at the attentional level − IC, and children with elevated TBR
were more inﬂuenced by task irrelevant stimuli. In other words, the
elevated TBR could be a marker of a weakness in IC in AD/HD. For
patients without the elevated ratio, on the other hand, a weakness was
demonstrated on DI. Given past research on BRIEF, however, it may be
that other abilities rather than inhibition itself may be compromised in
AD/HD children without the elevated TBR.

Future studies may explore the mechanism underlying the re-
lationship between TBR and each type of inhibition. One possible ex-
planation comes from recent ﬁndings in cognitive neuroscience.
Imaging studies report that brain resting networks interact with task-
related networks and impact on behavioral output
(Northoﬀ,
Duncan, & Hayes, 2010; Raichle, 2009). As EEG can detect the activity
of the resting networks (Raichle, 2009), TBR may be an electro-
physiological manifestation of speciﬁc resting networks, which in turn
implies the inhibitory abilities. Alternatively, the relationship may be
the consequence of TBR-related problems. Arns et al. (2013) proposed
that TBR may be associated with sleep duration, which can aﬀect the
neuropsychological functions (e.g. Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2010).
Thus, the relationship between TBR and inhibition may in fact result
from individual diﬀerences in sleep duration.
One issue related to this study is the methodology to obtain TBR.
Recently, obtaining TBR through individual frequency band rather than
the ﬁxed bands is suggested as EEG frequency bands may vary due to
the eﬀects of age (Saad, Kohn, Clarke, Lagopoulos, & Hermens, 2015).
Here, the ﬁxed band method was adopted to follow previous studies
(Barry & Clarke, 2009). Further studies may extend the ﬁndings based
on the individual frequency band method.

6. Conclusions

The purpose of the current study was to explore whether elevated
TBR indicated an inhibitory problem in children with AD/HD in light of
relevant ﬁndings in the healthy population. The results indicated a
functional disassociation − children with AD/HD who have elevated
TBR perform worse on interference control but perform better on day-
to-day inhibition, compared to children with AD/HD who do not have
elevated TBR. This suggests that TBR may be a biomarker for inhibitory
functions, which further supports the prognostic value of resting EEG
measures in AD/HD. Future studies might further explore the beha-
vioral implications of the disassociation indicated by TBR in children
with AD/HD.
