A large volume of research has been conducted over the last century to
understand fully the development of interrogative forms and functions in
English-speaking children (see Chouinard, , for a review). However,
Mandarin Chinese, the most widely spoken language in the world
(Graddol, ), has not been equally empirically explored. Recently,
there have been Chinese studies examining the development of
interrogative forms in L children (Fahn, ; Zhou, ), and forms
(Ding, ; Gao, ; Yuan, ) and functions (Wang, ; Yuan,
; Zhu & Wu, ) in L learners. However, very few were
conducted with representative samples to establish the developmental
norms or patterns of interrogative form and function in Mandarin
Chinese. We have already conducted a corpus-based study on early
question acquisition in Cantonese-speaking young children in Hong Kong
(Li, Tse, Wong, Wong & Leung, ). Mandarin Chinese, however,
differs greatly from Cantonese in terms of lexicon, syntax, and
pronunciation (Tse & Li, ) and therefore deserves a similar study. In
addition, the Mandarin-speaking children in the present study have a
monolingual language environment in Beijing, whereas their counterparts
in Hong Kong thrive in a ‘trilingual and biliterate’ society (Li & Rao,
). Comparing their acquisition of interrogative forms and functions
can provide some cross-linguistic evidence for the effects of language
environments. This study is thus aimed at filling the gap in the literature.
Another objective of this study is to examine further the cross-linguistic
universality of the Information Requesting Mechanism (IRM) proposed
by Chouinard (). Having reviewed all the studies on the early
acquisition of English questions, Chouinard hypothesized that request for
information (RfI) might be the universal and dominant function of
children’s question. This hypothesis, however, was challenged by our
previous study on early child Cantonese in  children aged , , and
 months (Li et al., ), which found that request for action (RfA)
rather than RfI might be the dominant interrogative function. This
inconsistent finding was regarded as the result of the cultural difference
between Cantonese- and English-speaking young children (Li et al., ).
But it might also be caused by the age differences in samples or the
linguistic differences between English and Cantonese. To verify this
cultural influence, we need to conduct a similar study on Mandarin
Chinese using samples that share the same Chinese culture and
communication task but speak different languages. Therefore, in this
study, we thoroughly examine the interrogatives elicited from a similar
early child Mandarin corpus and empirically explore the factors
influencing the early acquisition of interrogatives in order to determine
whether the IRM is applicable to Mandarin Chinese.
Development of interrogative forms in Mandarin Chinese.
Mandarin Chinese has a very complex interrogative system, which is
composed of a large number of members: question words (i.e. ‘what’,
‘who’), question forms (i.e. the ‘A-not-A’ construction), question mood
particle (i.e. ma), and intonation (Gao, ). The various combinations of
these members could make a question ambiguous and even controversial
for Chinese speakers, and even linguists, in terms of the scope of
questioning, the degree of question mood, and the degree of
grammaticalization of various question forms. This could easily lead to
misunderstanding and miscommunication (Gao, ) and make the
acquisition of interrogative forms a really challenging task (Gao, ) for
young Mandarin-speaking children.
The Chinese interrogative form is challenging not only for young children
but also for linguists, who have not achieved any consensus on a typology
(Gao, ; Matthews & Yip, ; Ross & Ma, ; Tse & Li, ).
Liing () identified four major interrogative forms: particle questions,
‘háishì’ questions, ‘A-not-A’ questions, and wh-questions. Also, Chinese
linguists have explored A-not-A questions in different syntactic contexts
(Cheng, ), and their modularity and forms (Huang, ; Hsieh,
). In this study, we adopted the most comprehensive and systematic
typology, which was proposed by Matthews and Yip (), as it has been
verified by our previous corpus-based studies on early child Cantonese
(Tse & Li, ; Li et al., ). As Cantonese has many more
interrogative forms than Mandarin Chinese (Li et al., ; Li, Wong,
Tse, Leung, & Ye, ), we used the eight forms commonly shared by
Cantonese and Mandarin interrogatives to allow a cross-linguistic
comparison between Cantonese and Mandarin interrogatives (for details,
please see ‘Coding of the interrogatives’ below).
Currently, the most common topic for early interrogative studies concerns
wh-questions in Mandarin Chinese. Fahn () studied the acquisition of
monoclausal wh-questions and found that subject wh-questions were much
easier to learn than object wh-questions for Chinese children aged between
four and six years. Zhou () found that young children exhibited an
adultlike sensitivity to the licensing environments for the non-interrogative
use of wh-words. Su, Jin, Wan, Zhang, and Su () found that young
children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could understand the
question readings rather than the statement readings of wh-words. Also,
there have been other wh-question studies on L–L transfer and
comparison among Japanese speakers (Yuan, ) and English speakers
(Yuan, ), and on different strategies for the acquisition of different
interrogative forms (Gao, ).
Another common topic is the sequence of question acquisition in Chinese
children. Ding () found that the sequence of yes/no question acquisition
was ma question > tag question and ba question > rhetorical question, and
this sequence was roughly similar for L and L Chinese learners. Wong
and Ingram () found that the sequence of Cantonese question
acquisition between one and three years of age was particle/intonation
questions > wh-questions > A-not-A questions. They tended to believe that
syntactic complexity, cognitive complexity, and personal/social factors, as
well as their interactions, could have determined the sequence of question
acquisition. In addition, our previous Cantonese studies (Li et al., ;
Tse & Li, ) found that girls produced more types of interrogative
forms than boys, and that there was a significant form–function
preference, with wh- and multiple questions being primarily used to seek
information. Is the same pattern found in the interrogative development of
Mandarin-speaking young children? This study addresses this question by
examining the development of interrogative forms with a large-scale
sample of Mandarin-speaking young children.
Development of interrogative functions in Mandarin Chinese.
Interrogative function refers to the pragmatic function of questioning (Li
et al., ), and it has been widely and repeatedly studied in the past two
centuries since Sully () identified two major functions of
interrogatives: asking for information (‘what’, ‘how old’, ‘where’, ‘who’)
and asking for reasons and causes. Piaget () created a complete
typology of interrogative functions: causality, reality and history, action
and intention, classification and evaluation, and calculation. Later on,
Smith (), Holzman (), and Sachs and Devin () further
categorized child questions into eight categories: external world, internal
state, request, imperative, attention getting, instruction, confirmation, and
repetition. Since the s, a corpus approach has been employed to
investigate the development of interrogative functions (Freed, ;
Sinclair & Gessel, ). It is important to note that half of those
functions identified in previous studies (Freed, ; Holzman, ;
Piaget, ; Sinclair & Gessel, ; Sully, ) are asking for
information (RfI), indicating that interrogatives often serve the function of
information seeking.
Recently, Chouinard () conducted a systematic literature review and
four separate studies on early interrogative development in young
American children. Together, the results of her four studies supported the
existence of the IRM as a way for children to learn about the world. As
RfI was the most dominant function (%) of American children’s
questions in her studies, she hypothesized that RfI might be “a universal
function of children’s interrogatives”. Tse and Li () used Chouinard’s
framework to test data drawn from their Early Child Cantonese Corpus,
and developed a typology of Cantonese interrogative functions: (i) request
for information (RfI) about names, locations, descriptions, and so forth;
(ii) request for action (RfA), such as to draw attention to themselves, to
declare something, to ask permission to do something, to generate
conversation, to seek confirmation or verification, to suggest certain
actions, and to prohibit some actions that they dislike; (iii) emotional
expression to convey their annoyance (anger) or disappointment
(dissatisfaction); and (iv) egocentric speech, which is directed to no one
but themselves. Using this typology, our previous study (Li et al., )
challenged the generality and applicability of Chouinard’s IRM hypothesis
and found that request for action (RfA) (rather than RfI) was the
dominant function of early childhood Cantonese. This contrary finding,
however, needs to be verified further with empirical evidence from an
early Mandarin corpus that shares the same culture and communication
task as in the Cantonese study but involves different languages. If
Cantonese- and Mandarin-speaking young children share the same pattern,
which is different from that of English, we could attribute this
inconsistent finding to cultural influences. If not, the factor of language
(instead of culture) should be highlighted.
Furthermore, previous studies have found cross-linguistic evidence to
support the form–function preference in early childhood interrogatives.
James and Seebach () found that yes/no questions were primarily used
as directives, whereas wh-questions were employed to initiate and maintain
conversations. A similar pattern was found by Shatz () and
Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman () with English-speaking children.
A previous study on early Cantonese questions (Li et al., ) also found
similar patterns: wh-questions were primarily used to request information,
and intonation/echo and the rhetorical questions were used to request
action. The present study further explores whether this preference is
cross-linguistic, based on the evidence from a corpus-based study of
Mandarin-speaking young children.
Predictors of early language development.
Many family, preschool, and environmental factors are known to have an
influence on early language acquisition. Family socioeconomic status
(SES) has been identified as one of these factors (Hart & Risley, ,
; McLoyd, ). Home language input such as parental support has
been found to be another predictor of young children’s acquisition of
wh-questions (Gullo, a, b). Other factors such as a supportive
home environment with rich reading resources, parent–child shared reading,
and maternal book-reading strategies can also make a great contribution to
early language development (DeJong & Leseman, ; Haden, Reese &
Fivush, ; Roberts, Jurgens & Burchinal, ). For example, Rowland,
Pine, Lieven, and Theakston () found that the acquisition order of
wh-questions could be predicted by the frequency with which the mother
used particular wh-words and verbs in conversations with the child.
Another important predictor of early language acquisition is TV viewing
time. Recent studies have repeatedly documented a negative association
between early TV exposure and language development (Barr, Lauricella,
Zack & Calvert, ; Hudon, Fennell & Hoftyzer, ; Pempek,
Kirkorian & Anderson, ; Tomopoulos, Dreyer, Berkule, Fierman,
Brockmeyer & Mendelsohn, ). Nathanson and Rasmussen ()
found that mother–child communication was less frequent and less
verbally responsive when dyads viewed TV. Duch et al. () found that
children who watched more than  hours of television a day had lower
communication scores. A very recent neuroimaging study (Takeuchi et al.,
) also confirmed the negative effect of TV viewing on a child’s verbal
intelligence quotient (VIQ). However, Takeuchi et al.’s study also found
some positive effects of TV viewing on the regional gray/white matter
volume of the frontopolar and medial prefrontal areas, visual cortex,
hypothalamus/septum, and sensorimotor areas in young children. All these
brain areas are associated with cognitive and intellectual abilities. Does TV
viewing have any negative or positive effects on early interrogative
development? Another aim of the present study is to determine whether
TV viewing has any negative or positive effects on early interrogative
development in Mandarin-speaking young children. The following
research questions were set up to guide this study:
. What are the interrogative forms produced by a representative sample of
Mandarin-speaking young children? Are there any age and gender
differences in the development of interrogative forms?
. What interrogative functions are present in early childhood Mandarin?
Are there any age and gender differences in the development of
interrogative functions?
. What are the predictors of early interrogative development in Mandarin
Chinese?

METHOD.
Participants.
The Early Childhood Mandarin Corpus used in this study consisted of the
utterances produced by  Mandarin-speaking preschoolers randomly
sampled from eight preschools located in the four major districts of
Beijing: Chaoyang, Dongcheng, Xicheng, and Haidian. This sample
represented children from four age groups (ages ;, ;, ;, and ;),
with twenty-one boys and twenty-one girls in each age group. As shown
in Table , the average age of each group was very close to their target
age, except for group  whose average age was ;. This is because the
sampling was carried out very early in the first semester, so most of the
kindergarteners had not achieved the target age. All the participants were
native speakers of Mandarin, and their parents and teachers also spoke
Mandarin at home and at preschool, respectively. Most of the parents were
degree holders, and some children had taken extracurricular activities and
private tutoring in the early years (see Table ). The average TV viewing
time ranged between · to · hours per day, and the parent–child
conversation time ranged between · to · hours per day.
Communication task.
Participants of the same age were paired randomly (boy/girl, boy/boy, or
girl/girl) and were left in the play corner to play for  minutes. A set of
regular toys, including cooking materials, faux food and fruit, furniture
and electrical appliances, hospital materials, and vehicles, was set up in the
corner (Li et al., ). The participants were free to play with any toys
and engaged in any type(s) of play they wished. They were encouraged to
talk while they were playing, and their conversation was videotaped with a
digital video camera. The assistant researcher observed but did not
intervene during the sessions, and there were no other children in the corner.
Transcription.
All the videotaped conversations were transcribed by trained research
assistants to a level of detail that captured all words and word fragments
(including overlapping speech) audible to the ear, and non-lexical fillers (e.g.
ah), as well as other vocalizations (e.g. laughter). Next, other research
assistants double-checked the transcripts against the video clips to ensure
accuracy of transcription. Then, the Chinese script was segmented into
utterances by the trained research assistants.
Coding of the interrogatives
Questions and interrogativeswere judged according to the standards given in Li
et al.’s () early childhood Cantonese study. A question was defined as a
linguistic expression of enquiry that invites or calls for a reply. An
interrogative was defined as the linguistic form of a question and could be a
word, a phrase, or a sentence. All the interrogatives were analyzed and coded
based on the coding systems as follows. Two authors of this paper coded %
of the interrogatives elicited from the corpus, and their mutual agreement
was more than %, indicating excellent inter-coder reliability. Then, one of
the co-authors coded the rest of the data (SFP = sentence-final particle).
() Intonation and echo questions: raising the intonation of a declarative or
echoing others’ declaratives to construct an interrogative form:
皮球不见了？
Piqiu bujian le?
Ball disappeared SFP
‘The ball disappeared?’
() Yes/no questions: adding a particle like ma (吗), ba (吧), aa (呀) to a
declarative sentence to ask for yes or no answers:
你想喝水吗?
Ni xiang heshui ma?
You want drink water SFP
‘Do you want to drink water’
() Wh- questions: using wh-words such as shenme (what) (什么), shui
(who) (谁), wei shenme (why) (为什么), and so on to produce an
interrogative:
这是什么呀？
Zheshi shenmo ya?
This is what SFP
‘What is this?’
() A-Not-A questions: repeating (or reduplicating) the verb or adjective
with the negative marker bu (不) in between to deliver an interrogative:
你认不认识他？
Ni ren bu renshi ta?
You know not know him
‘Do you know him or not?’
() Alternative question: conjoining two phrases with the conjunction
haishi (还是) or huozhe (或者) to offer a choice between two alternatives:
今天是星期一还是星期二?
Jintian shi xinqiyi haishi xinqier?
Today is Monday or Tuesday
‘Is today Monday or Tuesday?’
() Rhetorical question: an interrogative expressing negative meaning with
positive form or vice versa, which is not supposed to be answered:
我怎么知道呢？
Wo zenmo zhidao ne?
I how to know SFP
‘How should I know?’ (I don’t know, indeed)
() Indirect questions: using a clause beginning with wh-words to report a
question, which is normally called a reported question:
你知道谁要这本书吗？
Ni zhidao shui yao zheben shu ma?
You know who want this book SFP
‘Do you know who wants to have this book?’
() Multiple questions: two or more question words appearing in a
statement to request more information, as in the English “Where and
when are we going to meet?”:
我们几点钟在哪里见面?
Women jidianzhong zai nani jianmian?
We when at where meet up
‘When and where should we meet up?’
Parental report
One parent of each participating child was invited to complete the Home
Language Environment Survey (HLES), which was developed from the
Home Literacy Environment Index (HLEI) (Li & Rao, ). The HLES
consists of twenty-nine questions that tap parental beliefs and practices
about the home language environment, language input, parental
involvement, language resources, and learning strategies. The HLEI has
been developed and validated for use in Beijing, Hong Kong, and
Singapore (Li & Rao, ).
RESULTS
Altogether, , instances of Mandarin interrogative were elicited from
the corpus, which included all the utterances produced by the 
children. On average, each participant uttered · interrogative types
during the half-hour period of communication. Some , (·%) of the
interrogatives were produced by the boys, and the remaining , (·%)
by the girls. The interrogative types produced by the ;, ;, ;, and ;
age groups were  (·%),  (·%),  (·%), and  (·%),
respectively. The following analyses were executed to explore the
developmental trends in interrogative form and function, possible form–
function preferences, and the predictors of interrogative development.
The development of interrogative forms
First, a descriptive analysis was conducted to examine the occurrence of all
the interrogative forms proposed in this study. As shown in Table , the
four age groups produced five types of Mandarin interrogative forms:
‘intonation/echo’, ‘yes/no question’, ‘wh-question’, ‘A-not-A’, and ‘rhetorical
question’. However, ‘alternative question’, ‘indirect question’, and ‘multiple
question’ were not found or were very rarely produced. In particular,
wh-questions (·%) were very frequently produced, followed by
intonation/echo (·%) and yes/no question (·%).
Next, a set of ANOVAs with ages by sex as the independent variables was
applied to the three dependent variables: the total number of interrogative
types, forms, and functions. Significant Age effects were found in the total
number of interrogative types (F(,) = ·, p < ·, η = ·), forms
(F(,) = ·, p < ·, η = ·), and functions (F(,) = ·,
p < ·, η = ·). There was no significant Gender effect in the total
number of interrogative types (F(,) = ·, p > ·, η = ·), forms
(F(,) = ·, p > ·, η = ·), and functions (F(,) = ·, p > ·,
η = ·). In addition, there was no Age × Gender effect in the total
number of interrogative types, forms, and functions (ps > ·). A set of
post-hoc Tukey (HSD) tests found no significant differences in
interrogative forms between the ; and ; age groups (ps > ·), whereas
significant differences were found between the ; age group and the ;/
; age groups (ps < ·). The older children produced significantly more
types of interrogative form than the children under age :. This indicated
that between the ages of ; and ; might be the critical period in the
early development of interrogative forms.
Third, follow-up one-way ANOVAs were conducted to explore age
differences in the five interrogative forms found in this study. Significant
age differences were found in the distribution of wh-questions (F(,) =
·, p < ·), with post-hoc Tukey tests showing a statistically significant
difference between the ; and ; age groups (p < ·), and between the
; and ; age groups (p < ·). The older children produced significantly
more types of wh-questions than the children under age ;. In addition,
significant age differences were also found in the distribution of rhetorical
questions (F(,) = ·, p < ·), with post-hoc Tukey tests showing a
statistically significant difference between the ; and ; age groups
(p < ·). The ; age group produced significantly more types of
rhetorical questions than the : age group These results further
supported the conclusion that there is a dramatic growth in interrogative
forms between the ages of ; and ; in Mandarin-speaking children.
Last, gender differences were explored with a set of one-way ANVOAs.
All the interrogative forms appeared to be quite evenly distributed
between girls and boys, except for the wh-questions. A significant gender
difference was found in the distribution of wh-questions (F(,) = ·,
p < ·), with the girls (%) tending to ask a greater proportion of
wh-questions than the boys (·%) (see Table ). In summary, a
significant age effect was found in interrogative forms, and the period
between the ages of ; and ; was identified as critical in the early
acquisition of interrogative forms.
The development of interrogative functions.
As can be seen in Table , all the interrogative functions produced by the
participants could be placed into the three major categories suggested by
Chouinard (): (i) information-seeking (request for information, RfI),
(ii) action-beseeching (request for action, RfA), and (iii) non-informationseeking.
It was found that the interrogatives in early childhood Mandarin
served the function of soliciting information (·%) more often than the
function of seeking action (·%) and other functions (·%). Two-way
ANOVA analysis results indicated strongly significant age effects in
interrogative function (F(,) = ·, p < ·, η = ·). No significant
gender effects were found (F(,) = ·, p > ·, η = ·), and no
significant Age × Gender effects were found. Further analyses indicated a
significant age difference in the distribution of RfI (F(,) = ·,
p < ·), with post-hoc Tukey tests showing a statistically significant
difference between the ; age group and the three other age groups
(ps < ·). A significant age difference was also found in the distribution
of RfA (F(,) = ·, p < ·), with post-hoc Tukey tests showing a
statistically significant difference between the ; age group and the three
other age groups (ps < ·). All these results consistently indicated that
between the ages of ; and ; might be a critical period in the
acquisition of interrogative functions in Mandarin-speaking children.
Next, gender differences in interrogative functions were explored with a
one-way ANOVA. A significant gender difference was found in the
distribution of RfI (F(,) = ·, p < ·), with the girls (·%)
tending to make more requests for information than the boys (·%). As
shown in Figure , older children tended to make more requests for action
by asking questions, but fewer requests for information. In summary, a
significant age effect was found in interrogative functions, and a significant
gender difference was only found in the distribution of RfI. Also, between
the ages of ; and ; seemed to be the critical developmental period for
interrogative functions.
The form–function preference in Mandarin interrogatives.
As shown in Table , a form–function preference was found in the
production of interrogatives: the wh-questions (·%) were primarily used
to request information, whereas the intonation/echo (·%) and the
rhetorical (·%) questions were employed to request action. These
outcomes, as shown in Table , indicated that the Mandarin-speaking
young children tended (i) to seek information more frequently with
wh-questions (·%); (ii) to request action more frequently with rising
tone (·%) and rhetorical questions (·%); (iii) to be less likely to use
wh-questions to request action (·%); and (iv) to reduce their use of
rhetorical questions (·%) and a rising tone (·%) to elicit information.
Predictors of Chinese interrogative development.
To explore the variables associated with early interrogative development, we
conducted a correlation analysis on the variables involved. The correlation
matrix indicated that the following factors were significantly correlated
with individual production of question types, interrogative forms, and
functions: preschooling experience, extracurricular experience, private
tutoring in Chinese, early Chinese literacy, and TV viewing time (hours).
Next, to determine the relative contribution of these correlated factors, we
conducted four-step hierarchical regression analyses with individual
production of question types, interrogative forms, and functions as the
dependent variables. Results are shown in Table . In Step , we entered
age and gender to control for their effects. In Step , preschooling
experience and curriculum type were entered. In Step , extracurricular
experience and private tutoring in Chinese were entered. In Step , early
Chinese literacy, parent–child conversation time, and TV watching time
were entered.
The change in R between the four steps indicated that: (i) the age and
gender of the children could jointly explain ·%, %, and ·% of the
variation in individual production of interrogative types, forms, and
functions, respectively. In addition, age turned out to be the most
significant predictor of the production of interrogatives; (ii) preschooling
experience and curriculum type, extracurricular experience, and private
tutoring in Chinese could jointly explain ·%, ·%, and ·% of the
individual differences in interrogative types, forms, and functions,
respectively. However, none of them was a significant predictor; and (ii)
early Chinese literacy learning, TV viewing time, and parent–child
conversation time could jointly explain %, %, and ·% of the variation
in individual production of interrogative types, forms, and functions,
respectively. In particular, TV viewing time turned out to be the
significant predictor of question production and interrogative functions:
the greater the viewing time, the more the types of questions and
functions produced by the children. However, it had no significant effect
on the production of interrogative forms. It was very interesting to note
that parent–child conversation time became a significant predictor of
question production, although the correlation between them was negative.
This result indicated that the longer the parent–child conversation time,
the fewer the questions produced by the child. In summary, this set of
hierarchical regression analyses found that age, TV viewing time, and
parent–child conversation time were significant predictors of interrogative
development in Mandarin-speaking young children.
<Conclusion>
DISCUSSION
As the largest investigation ever made so far into early Mandarin
interrogatives, this study set out to examine rich corpus data in an attempt
to ascertain the trends and predictors with respect to early interrogative
development. Significant age differences were found for both interrogative
forms and functions, whereas significant gender differences were found
only in the distribution of wh-questions and RfI. The widely reported
form–function preference was verified, and the following predicators
were also identified: age, TV viewing time (hours), and parent–child
conversation time (hours). This section discusses these findings and their
implications for early language learning and teaching.
Age differences in interrogative development
The present study found that the Mandarin-speaking children produced five
types of Mandarin interrogative forms, but not the three complicated forms.
In addition, the study found a significant age effect in interrogative forms
and functions, and identified the periods between the ages of ; and ;
and between the ages of ; and ; as critical in the early acquisition of
interrogative forms and functions, respectively. All these findings,
however, were inconsistent with those of our previous study on early
Cantonese interrogatives (Li et al., ), in which all eight interrogative
forms and functions were produced by the ;–; age groups, and no age
difference was found. These inconsistent findings reflect the two different
developmental trajectories that the young Mandarin-speaking and the
young Cantonese-speaking children followed in acquiring interrogative
forms: in Beijing, the young children did not acquire all the interrogative
forms and functions until age ;, and the periods between ; and ;
and between ; and ; witnessed a rapid growth in interrogative forms
and functions. In Hong Kong, on the other hand, the young children
acquired all the interrogative forms and functions by the age of three, so
there was no age difference.
This contrast indicated that the Cantonese-speaking young children
developed interrogative forms and functions much earlier than their
counterparts in Beijing. In addition to the differences in language
(Cantonese versus Mandarin), there were significant differences in
language environment: Beijing is a monolingual society, whereas Hong
Kong is a typical ‘biliterate and trilingual’ society (Li & Rao, ). The
Hong Kong children were immersed in Cantonese, English, and Mandarin
environments (home, school, community, and media) in the early years
and might have benefited from this experience. However, this inconsistent
finding is empirically supported by the findings of Li and Chen’s ()
longitudinal study on Mandarin-speaking children’s question acquisition.
In their case study, a child was followed from age one to age five, and her
interrogative utterances were analyzed. The results indicated that the child
could produce all the interrogative forms listed in the case study around
;. Although their study and our study did not share exactly the same
typology of interrogative forms, they both indicated that Mandarinspeaking
young children tended to acquire some new interrogative forms
after the age of three. This difference between early Cantonese and
Mandarin interrogative acquisition might be associated with the
differences in languages, samples, and language environments. Also, we
tend to believe that early language environments affect question
acquisition, which deserves further comparative investigations.
Another notable finding was that the  Mandarin-speaking children
produced altogether , types of interrogative during the halfhour
communication sessions, generating a questioning rate of ·
per child per hour. This is significantly more than the questioning rates
(· questions per hour) in Li et al.’s () study with Cantonesespeaking
children, and the questioning rates ( questions per hour) in
Tizard and Hughes’s () study with English children. This finding
indicated that the young Beijing children might be more talkative with
their peers and tend to raise more questions than their Hong Kong
counterparts. This difference might also reflect their different early
language and learning experiences at home and in school. This, again,
deserves further studies.
Gender differences in interrogative development.
Very few significant gender differences were found in early Mandarin
interrogative development. First, regarding the early interrogative forms, it
was found that the girls produced relatively more wh-questions (in
percentages) than did the boys. This finding is not very consistent with
the findings of previous studies, which found that boys utilized more
wh-questions (Davis, ; Li et al., ; Smith, ). As our studies
on early childhood Cantonese (Li et al., ) and Mandarin shared the
same research design and communication task, this inconsistent finding,
again, might have been caused by the differences in samples (different age
groups), languages (Cantonese versus Mandarin), and language
environments between Beijing and Hong Kong. This study, for instance,
found that the ; age group produced many more wh-questions (·%)
than the other age groups (ranging between ·% and ·%). More
studies, however, are also needed to identify the real causes.
Second, the present study found that girls tended to make more requests
for information (RfI) than the boys. This finding is inconsistent with that
of our previous study, which found no significant gender difference in the
interrogative functions produced by the Cantonese-speaking preschoolers
(Li et al., ). As the two studies share the same culture, design, and
task, this inconsistent finding indicated that the gender difference in
interrogative functions might differ from Mandarin to Cantonese.
Although Chouinard () did not report any significant gender
difference in her four studies, other studies on English-speaking children
(Davis, ; Smith, ) have found that boys tend to ask more causal
questions using wh-questions than girls. So far, three types of results have
been reported concerning the early development of RfI functions: boys >
girls (Davis, ; Smith, ), boys = girls (Chouinard, ; Li et al.,
), and boys < girls (this study). In this connection, the only
conclusion might be that gender difference in early interrogative functions
could vary across languages, communication tasks, and social contexts.
This casts some doubt on the cross-linguistic universality of gender
differences in interrogative functions.
Universality of the IRM hypothesis.
The second objective of this study was to examine the cross-linguistic
universality of the Information Requesting Mechanism (IRM) proposed
by Chouinard (), which has been challenged by our previous study on
early Cantonese interrogatives (Li et al., ). The present study,
however, found that more than half (·%) of the Mandarin interrogatives
were requests for information (RfI), whereas only ·% of them were
requests for action (RfA). This large-scale study has provided very solid
cross-linguistic evidence to support Chouinard’s IRM, indicating that the
IRM mechanism might be applicable across languages and circumstances.
This finding, however, is inconsistent with that of our previous study on
early Cantonese interrogatives (Li et al., ). The two studies were
conducted by the same team and with the same research design and
communication task, and the only difference is that the current study
included a ; age group. Also, the present study found that the ; age
group produced relatively more information-seeking interrogatives (%)
and significantly boosted the overall percentage of RfI interrogatives. This
finding indicated that the young Mandarin-speaking children tended to
make more requests for information (RfI) before the age of three, and that
the dramatic changes occurred during the period between the ages of ;
and ;.
Coincidently, Chouinard’s four studies () mainly focused on younger
children, under age three or four, and her samples were relatively younger
than the samples in our early Cantonese corpus. Cantonese-speaking children
under age three might also produce more RfI in their interrogative functions.
Therefore, we tend to integrate our studies on early Cantonese and Mandarin
with Chouinard’s study on early English, and modify the IRM hypothesis as
follows: RfI predominates before age ;, while RfA predominates in the
post-; years, as the dominance of RfI versus RfA might change over the
course of a child’s development. However, further empirical studies are
needed to verify this modified hypothesis.
Last, the present study has further verified the form–function preference
in early Mandarin interrogatives. The young children tended to use
wh-questions to request information, and intonation/echo questions to seek
action. In contrast, intonation/echo questions were less frequently used to
elicit information, and wh-questions were rarely used to request action.
This has verified the patterns found in our previous study on
Cantonese-speaking children (Li et al., ) and in Celce-Murcia and
Larsen-Freeman’s () study on English-speaking children.
The predictors of Mandarin interrogative development.
The present study found that, in addition to the age of the children – the
most significant contributor – TV viewing time was a significant predictor
of interrogative types and functions. This finding implied that the greater
the TV viewing time, the more interrogative types and functions produced
by the children. This finding is not very consistent with recent studies,
which have consistently documented a negative association between early
TV exposure and language development (Barr et al., ; Hudon et al.,
; Pempek et al., ; Tomopoulos et al., ). However, none of
these studies used interrogatives as the language performance indicator. A
possible explanation for these ‘inconsistent’ findings is that TV viewing
could have triggered the young children’s curiosity about the outside
world, and accordingly generated more questions. Furthermore, as soon as
the young children had learnt more about the world through watching
TV, they would ask more questions with more pragmatic functions. And
further studies will be done to understand which interrogative functions
are directly affected by TV viewing time. Questions, however, do not
necessarily correlate with other language performance indicators. For
instance, we did not find any correlations between MLU and interrogative
development in our previous study on Cantonese-speaking children (Li
et al., ). Therefore, we would not regard this finding as inconsistent
with others; instead, we tend to conclude that TV viewing has both
positive and negative effects on various domains of early language
development. Thus, this study tends to lend empirical support to a
balanced view of TV viewing effects.
Second, the present study found that the more the parent–child
conversation time, the fewer the interrogative types produced by the child.
In early childhood years, parents are the primary ‘important others’ of
children, and family is the most important environment. In parent–child
shared book reading and communication, children respond to the story or
adults with comments and questions, and parents maintain their
interaction with children by proposing and answering questions. In this
mutual process, children acquire the ability to make questions. In Chinese
culture, however, parents do not converse on equal grounds with children
so routinely, and the latter are not encouraged to question authoritative
adults, such as parents and teachers (Li et al., ). Moreover, Chinese
children are expected to follow their parents’ or teachers’ instructions to
the letter. Therefore, the more the parent–child conversation, the fewer
the questions raised by the child. Nevertheless, another possible
interpretation might be that parent–child conversation could have satisfied
children’s curiosity to a large extent, so the latter would have fewer
questions. This assumption also needs further examination.
This is the first corpus-based psycholinguistic study on the development
of interrogative forms and functions and their predictors among Beijing
children. Using a corpus as a primary source of evidence allowed us to
establish the norms and to test the cross-linguistic generality of Choinard’s
IRM hypothesis. However, a major limitation of this corpus-based
research is that the data only represented a sample of the entire language,
and not the target language in its totality (Tse & Li, ). Therefore, it
should be borne in mind that this corpus might not contain all the
information needed to explore this issue. To minimize this eventuality, the
sample size needs to be increased, and data needs to be collected from
more typical, everyday contexts. This might be precisely the primary
limitation of this study. In addition, the sample was cross-sectional rather
than longitudinal, and the age range examined should have extended
downwards in order to elicit a more complete picture of the development
of interrogatives in the very early years, such as from age one to age two.
Nevertheless, the typology and pattern established in the present study
contributes to furthering the understanding of the development of
interrogative forms and functions in childhood Mandarin Chinese and to
broadening the database of interrogative development in different
languages. Furthermore, this study has provided some cross-linguistic
evidence to support the IRM hypothesis and has cast new light on the
importance of cross-cultural and cross-linguistic comparison of early child
interrogatives. In this connection, this study has raised more questions
than answers about early child interrogatives.
