This study examined the development of and possible predictors of
interrogative forms and functions in early childhood Mandarin. All
the interrogatives drawn from the Early Child Mandarin Corpus (
children ;, ;, ;, and ;) were analyzed. The main results
indicated that (i) there were signiﬁcant age eﬀects in interrogative
forms and functions, with the periods between the ages of ; and ;
and between the ages of ; and ; being critical
in the early
acquisition of interrogative forms and functions, respectively; (ii) the
form–function preference was veriﬁed, with wh-questions being
primarily used to seek information (RfI), and intonation/echo and
rhetorical questions being used to request action (RfA); (iii) more
than half (·%) of the Mandarin interrogatives were used for RfI,
whereas only ·% of them were used for RfA; and (iv) age, TV
viewing time, and parent–child conversation time were the signiﬁcant
predictors of interrogative development.

I N T R O D U C T I O N
A large volume of research has been conducted over the last century to
understand fully the development of interrogative forms and functions in
English-speaking children (see Chouinard, , for a review). However,
Mandarin Chinese,
the most widely spoken language in the world
(Graddol, ), has not been equally empirically explored. Recently,
there have been Chinese

interrogative forms in L children (Fahn, ; Zhou, ), and forms

; Zhu & Wu, )
in L learners. However, very few were
conducted with representative samples to establish the developmental
norms or patterns of
interrogative form and function in Mandarin
Chinese. We have already conducted a corpus-based study on early
question acquisition in Cantonese-speaking young children in Hong Kong
(Li, Tse, Wong, Wong & Leung, ). Mandarin Chinese, however,
diﬀers greatly from Cantonese
and
pronunciation (Tse & Li, ) and therefore deserves a similar study. In
addition, the Mandarin-speaking children in the present study have a
monolingual language environment in Beijing, whereas their counterparts
in Hong Kong thrive in a ‘trilingual and biliterate’ society (Li & Rao,
). Comparing their acquisition of interrogative forms and functions
can provide some cross-linguistic evidence for the eﬀects of language
environments. This study is thus aimed at ﬁlling the gap in the literature.
Another objective of this study is to examine further the cross-linguistic
universality of the Information Requesting Mechanism (IRM) proposed
by Chouinard (). Having reviewed all
the studies on the early
acquisition of English questions, Chouinard hypothesized that request for
information (RfI) might be the universal and dominant
function of
children’s question. This hypothesis, however, was challenged by our
previous study on early child Cantonese in  children aged , , and
 months (Li et al., ), which found that request for action (RfA)
rather than RfI might be the dominant
interrogative function. This
inconsistent ﬁnding was regarded as the result of the cultural diﬀerence
between Cantonese- and English-speaking young children (Li et al., ).
But it might also be caused by the age diﬀerences in samples or the
linguistic diﬀerences between English and Cantonese. To verify this
cultural
inﬂuence, we need to conduct a similar study on Mandarin
Chinese using samples

Development of interrogative forms in Mandarin Chinese
Mandarin Chinese has a very complex interrogative system, which is
‘what’,
composed of a large number of members: question words (i.e.
‘who’), question forms (i.e. the ‘A-not-A’ construction), question mood
particle (i.e. ma), and intonation (Gao, ). The various combinations of
these members could make a question ambiguous and even controversial

The Chinese interrogative form is challenging not only for young children
but also for linguists, who have not achieved any consensus on a typology
(Gao, ; Matthews & Yip, ; Ross & Ma, ; Tse & Li, ).
Liing () identiﬁed four major interrogative forms: particle questions,
‘háishì’ questions, ‘A-not-A’ questions, and wh-questions. Also, Chinese
linguists have explored A-not-A questions in diﬀerent syntactic contexts
(Cheng, ), and their modularity and forms (Huang, ; Hsieh,
). In this study, we adopted the most comprehensive and systematic
typology, which was proposed by Matthews and Yip (), as it has been
veriﬁed by our previous corpus-based studies on early child Cantonese
(Tse & Li, ; Li et al., ). As Cantonese has many more
interrogative forms than Mandarin Chinese (Li et al., ; Li, Wong,
Tse, Leung, & Ye, ), we used the eight forms commonly shared by

Currently, the most common topic for early interrogative studies concerns
wh-questions in Mandarin Chinese. Fahn () studied the acquisition of
monoclausal wh-questions and found that subject wh-questions were much
easier to learn than object wh-questions for Chinese children aged between
four and six years. Zhou () found that young children exhibited an
adultlike sensitivity to the licensing environments for the non-interrogative
use of wh-words. Su, Jin, Wan, Zhang, and Su () found that young
children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could understand the
question readings rather than the statement readings of wh-words. Also,
there have been other wh-question studies on L–L transfer and
comparison among Japanese speakers (Yuan, ) and English speakers
(Yuan, ), and on diﬀerent strategies for the acquisition of diﬀerent
interrogative forms (Gao, ).

Another common topic is the sequence of question acquisition in Chinese
children. Ding () found that the sequence of yes/no question acquisition
was ma question > tag question and ba question > rhetorical question, and
this sequence was roughly similar for L and L Chinese learners. Wong
and Ingram ()
the sequence of Cantonese question
acquisition between one and three years of age was particle/intonation
questions > wh-questions > A-not-A questions. They tended to believe that

of
interrogatives: asking for information (‘what’, ‘how old’, ‘where’, ‘who’)
and asking for reasons and causes. Piaget
() created a complete
typology of interrogative functions: causality, reality and history, action
and intention, classiﬁcation and evaluation, and calculation. Later on,
Smith (), Holzman (), and Sachs and Devin () further
categorized child questions into eight categories: external world, internal
state, request, imperative, attention getting, instruction, conﬁrmation, and
repetition. Since the s, a corpus approach has been employed to
investigate the development of
(Freed, ;
Sinclair & Gessel, ). It is important to note that half of those
functions identiﬁed in previous studies (Freed, ; Holzman, ;
Piaget, ; Sinclair & Gessel, ; Sully, ) are asking for
information (RfI), indicating that interrogatives often serve the function of
information seeking.

Recently, Chouinard () conducted a systematic literature review and
four
in young
American children. Together, the results of her four studies supported the
existence of the IRM as a way for children to learn about the world. As
function (%) of American children’s
RfI was the most dominant
questions in her studies, she hypothesized that RfI might be “a universal
function of children’s interrogatives”. Tse and Li () used Chouinard’s
framework to test data drawn from their Early Child Cantonese Corpus,
and developed a typology of Cantonese interrogative functions: (i) request
for information (RfI) about names, locations, descriptions, and so forth;
(ii) request for action (RfA), such as to draw attention to themselves, to
declare something,
to generate
conversation,
to suggest certain
actions, and to prohibit some actions that they dislike; (iii) emotional

and found that request
(rather than RfI) was the
dominant function of early childhood Cantonese. This contrary ﬁnding,
however, needs to be veriﬁed further with empirical evidence from an

Furthermore, previous studies have found cross-linguistic evidence to
support the form–function preference in early childhood interrogatives.
James and Seebach () found that yes/no questions were primarily used
as directives, whereas wh-questions were employed to initiate and maintain
conversations. A similar pattern was

Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman () with English-speaking children.
A previous study on early Cantonese questions (Li et al., ) also found
similar patterns: wh-questions were primarily used to request information,
and intonation/echo and the rhetorical questions were used to request
action. The present study further explores whether this preference is
cross-linguistic, based on the evidence from a corpus-based study of
Mandarin-speaking young children.

Predictors of early language development
Many family, preschool, and environmental factors are known to have an
inﬂuence on early language acquisition. Family socioeconomic status
(SES) has been identiﬁed as one of these factors (Hart & Risley, ,
; McLoyd, ). Home language input such as parental support has
been found to be another predictor of young children’s acquisition of
wh-questions (Gullo, a, b). Other factors such as a supportive
home environment with rich reading resources, parent–child shared reading,
and maternal book-reading strategies can also make a great contribution to
early language development (DeJong & Leseman, ; Haden, Reese &
Fivush, ; Roberts, Jurgens & Burchinal, ). For example, Rowland,
Pine, Lieven, and Theakston () found that the acquisition order of
wh-questions could be predicted by the frequency with which the mother
used particular wh-words and verbs in conversations with the child.

Another important predictor of early language acquisition is TV viewing
time. Recent studies have repeatedly documented a negative association

Kirkorian & Anderson, ; Tomopoulos, Dreyer, Berkule, Fierman,
Brockmeyer & Mendelsohn, ). Nathanson and Rasmussen ()
found that mother–child communication was less
frequent and less
verbally responsive when dyads viewed TV. Duch et al. () found that
children who watched more than  hours of television a day had lower
communication scores. A very recent neuroimaging study (Takeuchi et al.,
) also conﬁrmed the negative eﬀect of TV viewing on a child’s verbal
intelligence quotient (VIQ). However, Takeuchi et al.’s study also found
some positive eﬀects of TV viewing on the regional gray/white matter
volume of the frontopolar and medial prefrontal areas, visual cortex,
hypothalamus/septum, and sensorimotor areas in young children. All these
brain areas are associated with cognitive and intellectual abilities. Does TV
viewing have any negative or positive eﬀects on early interrogative
development? Another aim of the present study is to determine whether

Participants
The Early Childhood Mandarin Corpus used in this study consisted of the
utterances produced by  Mandarin-speaking preschoolers randomly
sampled from eight preschools located in the four major districts of
Beijing: Chaoyang, Dongcheng, Xicheng, and Haidian. This sample
represented children from four age groups (ages ;, ;, ;, and ;),
with twenty-one boys and twenty-one girls in each age group. As shown
in Table , the average age of each group was very close to their target
age, except for group  whose average age was ;. This is because the
sampling was carried out very early in the ﬁrst semester, so most of the
kindergarteners had not achieved the target age. All the participants were
native speakers of Mandarin, and their parents and teachers also spoke

degree holders, and some children had taken extracurricular activities and
private tutoring in the early years (see Table ). The average TV viewing
time ranged between · to · hours per day, and the parent–child
conversation time ranged between · to · hours per day.

Communication task
Participants of the same age were paired randomly (boy/girl, boy/boy, or
girl/girl) and were left in the play corner to play for  minutes. A set of
regular toys, including cooking materials, faux food and fruit, furniture
and electrical appliances, hospital materials, and vehicles, was set up in the
corner (Li et al., ). The participants were free to play with any toys
and engaged in any type(s) of play they wished. They were encouraged to
talk while they were playing, and their conversation was videotaped with a
digital video camera. The assistant researcher observed but did not
intervene during the sessions, and there were no other children in the corner.

Transcription
All the videotaped conversations were transcribed by trained research
assistants to a level of detail that captured all words and word fragments

(including overlapping speech) audible to the ear, and non-lexical ﬁllers (e.g.
ah), as well as other vocalizations (e.g. laughter). Next, other research
assistants double-checked the transcripts against the video clips to ensure
accuracy of transcription. Then, the Chinese script was segmented into
utterances by the trained research assistants.

Coding of the interrogatives
Questions and interrogatives were judged according to the standards given in Li
et al.’s () early childhood Cantonese study. A question was deﬁned as a
linguistic expression of enquiry that
invites or calls for a reply. An
interrogative was deﬁned as the linguistic form of a question and could be a
word, a phrase, or a sentence. All the interrogatives were analyzed and coded
based on the coding systems as follows. Two authors of this paper coded %
of the interrogatives elicited from the corpus, and their mutual agreement
was more than %, indicating excellent inter-coder reliability. Then, one of
the co-authors coded the rest of the data (SFP = sentence-ﬁnal particle).

()

Intonation and echo questions: raising the intonation of a declarative or
echoing others’ declaratives to construct an interrogative form:
皮球 不见 了？
Piqiu bujian le?
Ball disappeared SFP
‘The ball disappeared?’

() Yes/no questions: adding a particle like ma (吗), ba (吧), aa (呀) to a

declarative sentence to ask for yes or no answers:
你 想 喝水 吗?
Ni xiang heshui ma?
You want drink water SFP
‘Do you want to drink water’

() Wh- questions: using wh-words such as shenme (what) (什么), shui
(who) (谁), wei shenme (why) (为什么), and so on to produce an
interrogative:
这是什么 呀？
Zheshi shenmo ya?
This is what SFP
‘What is this?’

() A-Not-A questions: repeating (or reduplicating) the verb or adjective
with the negative marker bu (不) in between to deliver an interrogative:
你认不认识他？
Ni ren bu renshi ta?
You know not know him
‘Do you know him or not?’

‘Do you know who wants to have this book?’

Parental report
One parent of each participating child was invited to complete the Home

The development of interrogative forms
First, a descriptive analysis was conducted to examine the occurrence of all
the interrogative forms proposed in this study. As shown in Table , the
four age groups produced ﬁve types of Mandarin interrogative forms:
‘intonation/echo’, ‘yes/no question’, ‘wh-question’, ‘A-not-A’, and ‘rhetorical
question’. However, ‘alternative question’, ‘indirect question’, and ‘multiple
question’ were not found or were very rarely produced. In particular,
wh-questions

intonation/echo (·%) and yes/no question (·%).

Next, a set of ANOVAs with ages by sex as the independent variables was
applied to the three dependent variables: the total number of interrogative
types, forms, and functions. Signiﬁcant Age eﬀects were found in the total
number of interrogative types (F(,) = ·, p < ·, η = ·), forms
(F(,) = ·, p < ·, η = ·), and functions (F(,) = ·,

number of interrogative types (F(,) = ·, p > ·, η = ·), forms
(F(,) = ·, p > ·, η = ·), and functions (F(,) = ·, p > ·,

The development of interrogative functions
As can be seen in Table , all the interrogative functions produced by the
participants could be placed into the three major categories suggested by
Chouinard (): (i) information-seeking (request for information, RfI),
(ii) action-beseeching (request for action, RfA), and (iii) non-information-
seeking. It was found that the interrogatives in early childhood Mandarin
served the function of soliciting information (·%) more often than the

ANOVA analysis results indicated strongly signiﬁcant age eﬀects in
interrogative function (F(,) = ·, p < ·, η = ·). No signiﬁcant
gender eﬀects were found (F(,) = ·, p > ·, η = ·), and no
signiﬁcant Age × Gender eﬀects were found. Further analyses indicated a
signiﬁcant age diﬀerence in the distribution of RfI (F(,) = ·,
p < ·), with post-hoc Tukey tests showing a statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between the ; age group and the three other age groups
(ps < ·). A signiﬁcant age diﬀerence was also found in the distribution
of RfA (F(,) = ·, p < ·), with post-hoc Tukey tests showing a
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the ; age group and the three
other age groups (ps < ·). All these results consistently indicated that
between the ages of ; and ; might be a critical period in the

shown in Figure , older children tended to make more requests for action
by asking questions, but fewer requests for information. In summary, a

gender diﬀerence was only found in the distribution of RfI. Also, between

the ages of ; and ; seemed to be the critical developmental period for
interrogative functions.

The form–function preference in Mandarin interrogatives
As shown in Table , a form–function preference was found in the
production of interrogatives: the wh-questions (·%) were primarily used
information, whereas the intonation/echo (·%) and the
to request
(·%) questions were employed to request action. These
rhetorical
outcomes, as shown in Table ,
indicated that the Mandarin-speaking
young children tended (i)
to seek information more frequently with
wh-questions (·%); (ii) to request action more frequently with rising
tone (·%) and rhetorical questions (·%); (iii) to be less likely to use
wh-questions to request action (·%); and (iv) to reduce their use of
rhetorical questions (·%) and a rising tone (·%) to elicit information.

Predictors of Chinese interrogative development
To explore the variables associated with early interrogative development, we
conducted a correlation analysis on the variables involved. The correlation
matrix indicated that the following factors were signiﬁcantly correlated
with individual production of question types,
interrogative forms, and
functions: preschooling experience, extracurricular experience, private
tutoring in Chinese, early Chinese literacy, and TV viewing time (hours).

Next, to determine the relative contribution of these correlated factors, we
conducted four-step hierarchical
regression analyses with individual
production of question types, interrogative forms, and functions as the
dependent variables. Results are shown in Table . In Step , we entered
age and gender to control for their eﬀects. In Step , preschooling

experience and private tutoring in Chinese were entered. In Step , early
Chinese literacy, parent–child conversation time, and TV watching time
were entered.

The change in R between the four steps indicated that: (i) the age and
gender of the children could jointly explain ·%, %, and ·% of the
variation in individual production of
forms, and
functions, respectively. In addition, age turned out
to be the most
signiﬁcant predictor of the production of interrogatives; (ii) preschooling
experience and curriculum type, extracurricular experience, and private
tutoring in Chinese could jointly explain ·%, ·%, and ·% of the
individual diﬀerences
and functions,
respectively. However, none of them was a signiﬁcant predictor; and (ii)
early Chinese literacy learning, TV viewing time, and parent–child
conversation time could jointly explain %, %, and ·% of the variation
in individual production of interrogative types, forms, and functions,
respectively. In particular, TV viewing time turned out
to be the
signiﬁcant predictor of question production and interrogative functions:
the greater the viewing time,
the more the types of questions and
functions produced by the children. However, it had no signiﬁcant eﬀect
on the production of interrogative forms. It was very interesting to note

D I S C U S S I O N
As the largest
investigation ever made so far into early Mandarin
interrogatives, this study set out to examine rich corpus data in an attempt
to ascertain the trends and predictors with respect to early interrogative
development. Signiﬁcant age diﬀerences were found for both interrogative
forms and functions, whereas signiﬁcant gender diﬀerences were found
only in the distribution of wh-questions and RfI. The widely reported
form–function preference was veriﬁed, and the following predicators
were also identiﬁed: age, TV viewing time (hours), and parent–child
conversation time (hours). This section discusses these ﬁndings and their
implications for early language learning and teaching.

Age diﬀerences in interrogative development
The present study found that the Mandarin-speaking children produced ﬁve
types of Mandarin interrogative forms, but not the three complicated forms.
In addition, the study found a signiﬁcant age eﬀect in interrogative forms
and functions, and identiﬁed the periods between the ages of ; and ;
and between the ages of ; and ; as critical in the early acquisition of
interrogative
these ﬁndings,
however, were inconsistent with those of our previous study on early
Cantonese interrogatives (Li et al., ), in which all eight interrogative
forms and functions were produced by the ;–; age groups, and no age
diﬀerence was found. These inconsistent ﬁndings reﬂect the two diﬀerent
developmental
trajectories that the young Mandarin-speaking and the
young Cantonese-speaking children followed in acquiring interrogative
forms: in Beijing, the young children did not acquire all the interrogative
forms and functions until age ;, and the periods between ; and ;
and between ; and ; witnessed a rapid growth in interrogative forms
and functions. In Hong Kong, on the other hand, the young children
acquired all the interrogative forms and functions by the age of three, so
there was no age diﬀerence.

and might have beneﬁted from this experience. However, this inconsistent
ﬁnding is empirically supported by the ﬁndings of Li and Chen’s ()
longitudinal study on Mandarin-speaking children’s question acquisition.
In their case study, a child was followed from age one to age ﬁve, and her
interrogative utterances were analyzed. The results indicated that the child
could produce all the interrogative forms listed in the case study around

typology of
they both indicated that Mandarin-
speaking young children tended to acquire some new interrogative forms

Another notable ﬁnding was that the  Mandarin-speaking children
produced altogether , types of
interrogative during the half-
hour communication sessions, generating a questioning rate of ·
per child per hour. This is signiﬁcantly more than the questioning rates
(· questions per hour) in Li et al.’s () study with Cantonese-
speaking children, and the questioning rates ( questions per hour) in
Tizard and Hughes’s () study with English children. This ﬁnding
indicated that the young Beijing children might be more talkative with
their peers and tend to raise more questions than their Hong Kong
counterparts. This diﬀerence might also reﬂect
their diﬀerent early
language and learning experiences at home and in school. This, again,
deserves further studies.

Gender diﬀerences in interrogative development
Very few signiﬁcant gender diﬀerences were found in early Mandarin
interrogative development. First, regarding the early interrogative forms, it
the girls produced relatively more wh-questions (in

the ﬁndings of previous studies, which found that boys utilized more
wh-questions (Davis, ; Li et al., ; Smith, ). As our studies
on early childhood Cantonese (Li et al., ) and Mandarin shared the
same research design and communication task, this inconsistent ﬁnding,
again, might have been caused by the diﬀerences in samples (diﬀerent age
groups),

environments between Beijing and Hong Kong. This study, for instance,
found that the ; age group produced many more wh-questions (·%)

studies, however, are also needed to identify the real causes.

Second, the present study found that girls tended to make more requests
for information (RfI) than the boys. This ﬁnding is inconsistent with that
of our previous study, which found no signiﬁcant gender diﬀerence in the
interrogative functions produced by the Cantonese-speaking preschoolers
(Li et al., ). As the two studies share the same culture, design, and
task, this inconsistent ﬁnding indicated that the gender diﬀerence in
interrogative

Although Chouinard () did not
report any signiﬁcant gender
diﬀerence in her four studies, other studies on English-speaking children
(Davis, ; Smith, ) have found that boys tend to ask more causal
questions using wh-questions than girls. So far, three types of results have
been reported concerning the early development of RfI functions: boys >
girls (Davis, ; Smith, ), boys = girls (Chouinard, ; Li et al.,
), and boys < girls
the only
conclusion might be that gender diﬀerence in early interrogative functions
could vary across languages, communication tasks, and social contexts.
This casts some doubt on the cross-linguistic universality of gender
diﬀerences in interrogative functions.

Universality of the IRM hypothesis
The second objective of this study was to examine the cross-linguistic
universality of the Information Requesting Mechanism (IRM) proposed
by Chouinard (), which has been challenged by our previous study on
early Cantonese interrogatives (Li et al., ). The present study,
however, found that more than half (·%) of the Mandarin interrogatives
were requests for information (RfI), whereas only ·% of them were
requests for action (RfA). This large-scale study has provided very solid
cross-linguistic evidence to support Chouinard’s IRM, indicating that the
IRM mechanism might be applicable across languages and circumstances.
This ﬁnding, however, is inconsistent with that of our previous study on
early Cantonese interrogatives (Li et al., ). The two studies were
conducted by the same team and with the same research design and
communication task, and the only diﬀerence is that the current study
included a ; age group. Also, the present study found that the ; age
group produced relatively more information-seeking interrogatives (%)
and signiﬁcantly boosted the overall percentage of RfI interrogatives. This
ﬁnding indicated that the young Mandarin-speaking children tended to
make more requests for information (RfI) before the age of three, and that
the dramatic changes occurred during the period between the ages of ;
and ;.

Coincidently, Chouinard’s four studies () mainly focused on younger

than the samples in our early Cantonese corpus. Cantonese-speaking children
under age three might also produce more RfI in their interrogative functions.
Therefore, we tend to integrate our studies on early Cantonese and Mandarin
with Chouinard’s study on early English, and modify the IRM hypothesis as
follows: RfI predominates before age ;, while RfA predominates in the
post-; years, as the dominance of RfI versus RfA might change over the
course of a child’s development. However, further empirical studies are
needed to verify this modiﬁed hypothesis.

Last, the present study has further veriﬁed the form–function preference
in early Mandarin interrogatives. The young children tended to use
wh-questions to request information, and intonation/echo questions to seek
action. In contrast, intonation/echo questions were less frequently used to
elicit information, and wh-questions were rarely used to request action.
This has veriﬁed the patterns

found in our previous

The predictors of Mandarin interrogative development
The present study found that, in addition to the age of the children – the
most signiﬁcant contributor – TV viewing time was a signiﬁcant predictor
of interrogative types and functions. This ﬁnding implied that the greater
the TV viewing time, the more interrogative types and functions produced
by the children. This ﬁnding is not very consistent with recent studies,
which have consistently documented a negative association between early
TV exposure and language development (Barr et al., ; Hudon et al.,
; Pempek et al., ; Tomopoulos et al., ). However, none of
these studies used interrogatives as the language performance indicator. A
possible explanation for these ‘inconsistent’ ﬁndings is that TV viewing
could have triggered the young children’s curiosity about the outside
world, and accordingly generated more questions. Furthermore, as soon as
the young children had learnt more about the world through watching
TV, they would ask more questions with more pragmatic functions. And
further studies will be done to understand which interrogative functions
are directly aﬀected by TV viewing time. Questions, however, do not
necessarily correlate with other language performance indicators. For
instance, we did not ﬁnd any correlations between MLU and interrogative
development in our previous study on Cantonese-speaking children (Li
et al., ). Therefore, we would not regard this ﬁnding as inconsistent
with others;
instead, we tend to conclude that TV viewing has both
positive and negative eﬀects on various domains of early language
development. Thus,

balanced view of TV viewing eﬀects.

the more the parent–child
conversation time, the fewer the interrogative types produced by the child.
In early childhood years, parents are the primary ‘important others’ of
children, and family is the most important environment. In parent–child
shared book reading and communication, children respond to the story or
adults with comments
and parents maintain their
interaction with children by proposing and answering questions. In this
mutual process, children acquire the ability to make questions. In Chinese
culture, however, parents do not converse on equal grounds with children
so routinely, and the latter are not encouraged to question authoritative
adults, such as parents and teachers (Li et al., ). Moreover, Chinese
children are expected to follow their parents’ or teachers’ instructions to
the letter. Therefore, the more the parent–child conversation, the fewer
the questions
another possible
interpretation might be that parent–child conversation could have satisﬁed
children’s curiosity to a large extent, so the latter would have fewer
questions. This assumption also needs further examination.

This is the ﬁrst corpus-based psycholinguistic study on the development
of interrogative forms and functions and their predictors among Beijing
children. Using a corpus as a primary source of evidence allowed us to
establish the norms and to test the cross-linguistic generality of Choinard’s
IRM hypothesis. However, a major
this corpus-based
research is that the data only represented a sample of the entire language,
and not the target language in its totality (Tse & Li, ). Therefore, it
should be borne in mind that this corpus might not contain all the
information needed to explore this issue. To minimize this eventuality, the
sample size needs to be increased, and data needs to be collected from
more typical, everyday contexts. This might be precisely the primary
limitation of this study. In addition, the sample was cross-sectional rather
than longitudinal, and the age range examined should have extended
downwards in order to elicit a more complete picture of the development
of interrogatives in the very early years, such as from age one to age two.
Nevertheless, the typology and pattern established in the present study

than answers about early child interrogatives.
