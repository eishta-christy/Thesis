The contribution of parent input to children’s subsequent expressive
verb diversity was explored in twenty typically developing toddlers
with small verb lexicons. Child developmental factors and parent
input measures (i.e. verb quantity, verb diversity, and verb-related
structural cues) at age ; were examined as potential predictors of
children’s verb production in spontaneous language samples at age
;. Parent verb input diversity, rather than input quantity, was the
factor contributing to children’s subsequent verb
primary input
diversity. Regression analysis showed that verb diversity in parent
input at age ; accounted for % of the variance in children’s verb
production six months later, with children’s total vocabulary size at
age ; accounting for an additional % of the variance. These
ﬁndings demonstrate the relative contributions of developmental and
input
language
development and establish the importance of input diversity to verb
acquisition.

than noun acquisition. First, verbs

Verbs emerge later than nouns and occupy a smaller percentage of the initial
lexicon (Bates et al., ; Nelson, ). Theoretically, verb acquisition
may be more diﬃcult
involve
conceptually more complicated notions (cf. Gleitman, Cassidy, Nappa,
Papafragou & Trueswell, ). Whereas early common nouns denote
entities, verbs denote event structures. The meaning of verbs must encode
relationships between the event and one or more noun phrases, also known
as arguments. Second, information in the input may provide more support
for the acquisition of nouns relative to verbs. Nouns in the input tend to
be aligned with the physical objects they refer to, but verbs in the input
may not be ‘time locked’ to the events they describe (Gleitman et al.,
). Finally, “verb acquisition entails the learning of sentence frames”
(Hadley, , p. ). To learn a verb meaning is to learn what noun
phrase arguments are involved and how to arrange the verb and the
arguments in the correct sequence (Pinker, ; Rice, ). In this
sense, the expansion of the verb lexicon provides a foundation for the
development of simple, diverse sentences (Hadley, ).

perspectives. One

Despite the importance of

the verb lexicon to children’s language
development, few studies have investigated how input aﬀects children’s
verb acquisition, and diﬀerent research traditions have approached this
question
in
developmental and educational psychology has focused on understanding
relationships between language
in
children’s rate of vocabulary development. These input studies have
established the associations between lexical quantity and lexical diversity
in parent input and children’s general vocabulary development (Hoﬀ &
Naigles, ; Huttenlocher, Haight, Bryk, Seltzer & Lyons, ;
Huttenlocher, Waterfall, Vasilyeva, Vevea & Hedges, ; Rowe, ).
By the third year of life, lexical diversity in parent input has been shown
to be a stronger predictor of children’s later vocabulary abilities than the
sheer quantity of words in parent input (Rowe, ). However, it is not
clear whether such relationships hold speciﬁcally for the verb lexicon. An
alternative approach, inﬂuenced by psycholinguistic theories of language
acquisition, has focused on the problem of how children learn verb
meanings. Theories of SYNTACTIC BOOTSTRAPPING have proposed that
children are sensitive to verb-related syntactic and morphological cues, as
these cues may serve to restrict verb meanings (Behrend, Harris &
Cartwright, ; Fisher, Hall, Rakowitz & Gleitman, ; Naigles &
Swensen, ; Yuan, Fisher & Snedeker, ). However, little is known
about the nature of these structural cues in naturalistic parent input and
how parents vary in providing verb-related structural cues to their
children. The current study integrated these two research traditions by
investigating the contribution of lexical quantity,
lexical diversity, and

The methods used in early input studies were primarily observational,
with studies documenting correlations between features of naturalistic
parent speech at Time  and children’s progress in language development
between Time  and Time  (see Richards, , and Valian, , for
comprehensive reviews). More recent studies have associated parent input
quantity and diversity with children’s language development
(Hoﬀ &
Naigles, ; Huttenlocher et al., , ; Rowe, ). For example,
Hoﬀ and Naigles () studied sixty-three children who ranged in age
from ; to ;. Time  parent input measures, speciﬁcally the number of
total words, the number of diﬀerent words, and mean length of utterance
(MLU) in morphemes, were positively associated with children’s Time 
vocabulary size obtained  weeks later. Huttenlocher et al.
()
reported converging results using a more sophisticated measure of
children’s vocabulary GROWTH for twenty-two children from ; to ;.
After controlling for child gender, Huttenlocher and colleagues found that
the variance in children’s rate of vocabulary
approximately % of
acceleration was accounted for by the number of total words in the parent
input. Huttenlocher et al. () adopted a similar longitudinal design,
following the children from ; to ;. They found that both lexical and
grammatical development were predicted by parent input quantity and
diversity. Additionally, Huttenlocher and colleagues revealed bi-directional
inﬂuences with children’s language abilities accounting for later lexical
measures of parent input. This means that parents were not only exerting
an inﬂuence on children’s later language development, but they were also
adjusting their vocabulary input
lexical
development. However, bi-directional
inﬂuences were not apparent for
the grammatical measures. Most recently, Rowe () examined the
input quantity and diversity to children’s
contribution of parent
vocabulary abilities one year later on a standardized measure of receptive
vocabulary knowledge. Diﬀerent
input properties emerged as better
predictors of children’s vocabulary scores at diﬀerent time points. Parent
input quantity at ; was most strongly related to children’s vocabulary
scores at ;, whereas input richness in both vocabulary diversity and
sophistication at ; were stronger predictors of the subsequent vocabulary
scores at ;. These ﬁndings underscore the importance of children’s
exposure to diverse words in parent input during the third year of life.

Other input studies have been inspired by the SYNTACTIC BOOTSTRAPPING
HYPOTHESIS, focusing on verb-related structural cues such as syntactic

verb meanings according to the structural environments in which verbs
occur (Gleitman, ; Landau & Gleitman, ; Naigles & Swensen,
). Structural cues tend to correspond with verb semantics (Naigles &
Hoﬀ-Ginsberg, , ). For example, verbs involving agent-and-
patient relations such as take and push usually occur in the transitive frame
(Naigles & Hoﬀ-Ginsberg, ). In experimental studies, children show
sensitivity to structural cues such as the number of arguments attached to
verbs or the morphological contexts of verbs (Behrend et al., ; Fisher
et al., ; Yuan et al., ). The hypothesis is that the more diﬀerent
structural cues a verb co-occurs with, the earlier the verb will emerge in
the lexicon. Children may also use the verb in more diﬀerent ways.

Guided by the syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis, Naigles and Hoﬀ-
Ginsberg (, ) investigated ﬁfty-seven parent–child dyads and
collected naturalistic conversations at home. The relationship between
Time  parents’ verb use and Time  children’s verb production was
examined, with a -week interval between Time  and Time . The
input sample at Time  was constructed by combining the ﬁfty-seven
parent speech samples into a single input corpus, with each parent
providing the same number of utterances (i.e. ). The child speech
sample at Time  was constructed by combining the ﬁfty-seven child
speech samples into a single child corpus, with each child contributing
ninety utterances. Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg examined the emergence of
twenty-ﬁve commonly used verbs in parent
input and child speech,
analyzing the verb frequency and the verb-related syntactic frames in the
pooled input sample. They coded two types of syntactic frames, the ‘broad
syntactic frames’ and the ‘narrow syntactic frames’. The broad frames
identiﬁed
postverbal
prepositional phrases, and adverbs. Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg showed
that the broad frames in parent input were reliable cues to the verb
input sentences containing the
semantics. For example, % of all
transitivity frame had main verbs
that
indicated agent-and-patient
relations. Likewise, % of input sentences with a post-verbal sentence
frame had main verbs that referred to internal states such as think and
know. Finally, % of
input sentences with postverbal prepositional
phrases had main verbs that denoted physical motions such as come and
go. In a second analysis, Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg used the narrow
frames to identify the SEQUENCE of non-head materials of the target verb
phrases. This was hypothesized to reﬂect the potential parsing strategies
children with rudimentary syntax might adopt when listening to input.
Using the narrow syntactic frame coding, Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg
showed that the frequency of individual verbs in the Time  child speech
was signiﬁcantly correlated with Time  input verb frequency and the
narrow syntactic frame diversity. The regression analysis suggested that

Time  input verb frequency explained % of the variance in Time 
verb frequency in child production, and the narrow syntactic frame
diversity accounted for an additional % of the variance beyond the input
verb frequency. Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg interpreted this ﬁnding as
evidence that using multiple syntactic frames with verbs facilitates verb
learning. Of interest to the current study was whether syntactic frame
diversity would also support children’s verb acquisition when applied to
individual parent–child dyads, a question that Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg
did not ask.

In another study of structural cues, de Villiers () investigated the
input and children’s production of verb
relationship between parent
morphology with two parent–child dyads. Language
samples were
collected through bi-weekly -hour sessions at home in a series of ten
sessions. The input sample was constructed for each child by combining
the mother’s speech in the ﬁrst ﬁve sessions. Both parents’ and children’s
verb use were coded for their immediately adjacent morphemes, with
thirteen morphological contexts identiﬁed. Examples are third person
singular present tense -s, present progressive tense V-ing, or regular past
tense -ed. Only verbs that were shared between the parent input and the
child output were analyzed. Children’s morphological variety of verb use
was regressed on children’s verb frequency, input verb frequency, and
input morphological variety of verb use. Separate regression analyses for
the two children revealed similar results. Morphological variety of verb
use in the parent input was the only signiﬁcant predictor for both parent–
child dyads. Furthermore, de Villiers found that each child’s production
was predicted by their own mother’s verb use, but not by that of the other
mother. De Villiers suggested that the input and the output of individual
parent–child dyads were unique to the dyad, and not to more general
properties of parent input to children.

frames

Though Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg () and de Villiers ()
demonstrated that verb-related syntactic
and morphological
contexts in parent input are helpful for children to learn verbs, these
studies have several
limitations. First, methodological choices in study
design temper the strength of the generalizations that can be drawn. Recall
that Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg used pooled speech samples of maternal
input and child output to study how input properties inﬂuenced the
acquisition of DIFFERENT VERBS. Their study was not designed to examine
the contribution of diﬀerences in parent input to between-child diﬀerences
in verb diversity. The ﬁndings therefore cannot be generalized to the verb
acquisition of
individual children. In contrast, de Villiers examined
individual parent–child dyads, but the sample size (two dyads) was very
small. Second, Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg did not provide a clear rationale
for assessing narrow syntactic frame diversity as a parent input property.

Given that they stated “it is not obvious how these narrow frame diﬀerences
might translate into meaning diﬀerences for the children” (Naigles &
Hoﬀ-Ginsberg, , p. ), the measure of narrow frame diversity
seems to lack a solid theoretical basis. Third, these studies examined only
a subset of common verbs. And ﬁnally, the relationship between the
children’s verb use and parents’ verb use was not controlled. Based on
ﬁndings of Huttenlocher et al. (),
it is important to consider the
possibility of bi-directional
inﬂuences from child to parent, as well as
parent to child.

In summary, two gaps are apparent in our understanding of how
naturalistic input contributes to children’s verb acquisition. First, it is not
clear whether the relationships that exist between input quantity, input
diversity, and children’s lexical development hold speciﬁcally for verbs.
Second, much less is known about how verb-related structural cues are
used in naturalistic parent input, such as syntactic frame diversity and
morphological context diversity. Whether these cues provide additional
beneﬁt to increase children’s verb lexicon remains uncertain. The current
study addressed these issues by investigating the contribution of parent
input to children’s subsequent verb diversity. Conventional measures of
verb input quantity and diversity were included, as well as theoretically
motivated measures of syntactic and morphological context diversity (de
Villiers, ; Naigles & Hoﬀ-Ginsberg, , ). In addition, we
expected children’s prior developmental abilities to inﬂuence subsequent
verb acquisition. Children who used more diﬀerent words early in
development were anticipated to produce more diﬀerent verbs six months
later. Controlling for initial vocabulary abilities was also important in light
of Huttenlocher
inﬂuences
between children’s vocabulary abilities and lexical properties of parent
input. Children’s intelligibility and talkativity during conversations were
also considered, because these factors might
input.
Finally, child gender was considered, because Huttenlocher et al. ()
reported that gender inﬂuenced the rate of lexical development, with girls
accelerating more quickly than boys before ;.

Participants
Participants for the current study were selected from an existing longitudinal
database funded by the Natural Science Foundation (NSF; Rispoli &
Hadley, ). Fifty-eight families were originally recruited for a study of
the acquisition of tense and agreement in toddlers between ; and ; in
English monolingual homes. Children with congenital or acquired
neurological or sensory impairments,
insertion of pressure equalization
tubes as a result of repeated bouts of otitis media, or delayed onset of
walking or
talking (i.e. after ;) were not eligible to participate.
Spontaneous language samples were collected in the lab playroom at ages
;, ;, ;, ;, ;, and ;. The -hr data collection involved two
contexts. Parents were instructed to “play as they would at home” with
their children for the ﬁrst  min with age-appropriate toys. In the second
-min context, an examiner joined the parent–child dyads to create more
opportunities for the children to produce tense and agreement morphemes
with diﬀerent lexical subjects and verbs. Information regarding children’s
general development and language production was also available from two
parent report checklists, the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ; Bricker
& Squires, ) and the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development
Inventories: Words and Sentences (CDI; Fenson, Marchman, Thal, Dale,
Reznick & Bates, ). For a parent–child dyad to be included in the
current study, the children were required to: (a) demonstrate a passing
score on the communication section of ASQ at ; and ;;
(b)
demonstrate an expressive vocabulary at or above the th percentile on
the CDI at ;; and (c) have no history of early intervention (EI) services
prior to ;. The above criteria excluded twelve children and identiﬁed
forty-six children as typically developing in regards to communication and
vocabulary development. From this pool, twenty-one children with ten or
fewer action words on the CDI (i.e. Part I section : Action Words) at ;
were selected. Based on cross-sectional CDI norms, these children could
be characterized as low-average typically developing toddlers (i.e. th
percentile at  months =  action words; Dale & Fenson, ;
Jørgensen, Dale, Bleses & Fenson, ). We then combined the verbs

parents reported on the CDI with the diﬀerent verbs children produced in
the ; language sample. The number of diﬀerent verbs combined for one
girl was  SD above the mean for the participants selected; therefore, she
was excluded due to her outlier status. Together, the combination of
inclusionary and exclusionary criteria created a homogeneous group of
typically developing children. Selecting a homogeneous sample was an
important design feature for revealing the contribution of input to verb
acquisition for two reasons. First, it minimized the extent to which prior
verb lexicon size would inﬂuence subsequent outcomes. Second, it reduced
the possibility that diﬀerences observed in parents’ use of verbs in their
child-directed speech could be attributed to diﬀerences in children’s initial
status.

The twenty children ( boys) selected for this study had one to thirteen
verbs (M = ·, SD = ·)
in their expressive vocabulary at ;, as
determined by the combination of CDI action words reported and the
verbs children produced in the language sample. Most children were in
the single-word stage, with their MLUs in morphemes ranging from ·
to · (M = ·, SD = ·). Boys were over-represented in this sample
because of diﬀerences in CDI action words reported at ;. Approximately
two-thirds of the typically developing boys in the database had ten or
fewer CDI action words reported, whereas only one-fourth of the girls
met this inclusionary criteria.

Twenty parents ( father) participated in the study, ranging in age from
(M = ·, SD = ·). Parents’ highest
twenty-three to forty years
educational levels included completion of high school (n = ), associate’s
degree or some college (n = ), bachelor’s degree (n = ), and advanced
degree (n = ). Participating parents and children were primarily White,
non-Hispanic (n = ). One parent self-identiﬁed as White Hispanic and
three parents self-identiﬁed as Black (n = ).

Language samples
The input speech samples came from the -min of parent–child free play at
;. Each sample was transcribed according to the standard conventions
of the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT; Miller &
Iglesias, ). The transcription of adult and child utterances was
completed separately by trained graduate or undergraduate research
assistants based on audio- and video-recordings. Transcribers listened to
each utterance a maximum of three times and used video-recordings to
provide information about the physical context, if necessary. Following the
initial transcription pass, a second transcriber completed a consensus pass
(cf. Shriberg, Kwiatkowski & Hoﬀmann, ),
re-listening to the
recording and marking as unintelligible or removing any morphemes that

could not be conﬁrmed. The consensus transcriber was allowed to add
content words, but was not allowed to add tense/agreement morphemes
without conﬁrmation by a third transcriber, since the original study
focused on the acquisition of tense and agreement.

Measures and the coding procedures

Parent input measures at ;. Measures of parent input from the ;
measurement point were computed to characterize the total amount of
parent input, the quantity and diversity of verb input, and the verb-related
structural cues provided by the parents. These parent input variables were
examined as potential predictors of children’s ; verb diversity.

. Descriptive measures. Several descriptive measures were computed from
parents’ spontaneous, complete, and fully intelligible utterances, including
the number of total utterances addressed to the children, the number of
total words, and the number of diﬀerent words produced by the parents.
Utterances produced during singing, book reading, or daily and game-
playing routines (e.g. ‘peekaboo’) were excluded. When computing the
number of total words and the number of diﬀerent words, we followed the
general procedures of Huttenlocher and colleagues (Huttenlocher et al.,
; Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Waterfall, Vevea & Hedges, ). Speciﬁc
classes of words such as animal noises (e.g. baaa, moo, quack, etc.), letter
names, and parental imitations of babbling were excluded. Interjections
such as ooh, oops, or ohno, and words used as interjections such cool, great,
or darn were also excluded. Words derived from derivational aﬃxes were
types (e.g. bake and baker). Regular inﬂectional
considered diﬀerent
variants of one word were considered the same type (e.g. cook, cooks,
cooking, and cooked), whereas irregular inﬂectional variants were considered
distinct types (e.g. run and ran; goose and geese; go and went; see and saw).
Frequently used irregular forms in English tend to be phonologically
distinct from their base forms, and children might treat the early irregular
forms and the base forms as separate words. A proper name and its
nickname were considered one word type (e.g. Cynthia and Cindy).
Diminutives
also
standardized and counted as examples of the same word type (e.g. doggy
and dog; ma, mama, mommy, and mom).

and commonly occurring motherese words were

. Measures of verbs. The quantity and diversity of verbs were measured by
the number of total verbs and the number of diﬀerent verbs produced by the
parents. Verbs that could be used as main verbs or as auxiliaries (i.e. have and
do) were counted only when parents used them as main verbs.

context diversity proposed by Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg (, ) and
de Villiers () were examined. To control the eﬀect of verb frequency
upon the diversity of structural cues, only the ten most frequently used
verbs in each language sample were analyzed. Verbs used less than ﬁve
times were excluded because they provided insuﬃcient opportunities for
parents to demonstrate diversity. Five verbs (i.e. eat, go, help, sit, and stop)
that were already produced by more than % of the children (n = ) were
also excluded in order to reduce the inﬂuence of children’s verb use on
parents’ verb use. These procedures were adopted to focus on verbs that
were: (a) not initially part of children’s lexicon; and (b) frequent enough
to demonstrate the diversity of structural cues if present. Note that the
number of frequent verbs that met these criteria varied among parents. A
parent might have less than ten verbs in this analysis because fewer verbs
were produced at least ﬁve times. Other parents might have more than ten
verbs in the analysis if two or more verbs were produced with an identical
frequency.

.. Syntactic frame diversity. Recall that Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg
(, ) used the broad frame coding to demonstrate the frame cue
validity in restricting verb meanings, and the narrow frame coding to
assess input syntactic frame diversity and its relationship to children’s use
of corresponding verbs. Because their narrow frame coding was not
theoretically motivated, we integrated their two types of frame coding to
form the current coding scheme. This approach retained the spirit of
Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg’s narrow frame coding in that it provided
more opportunities to capture input variation for each verb type than
would be possible with the broad frame coding alone. At the same time, it
preserved the cue validity to verb semantics that was revealed by the broad
frame coding.

The broad frame coding was adopted with two modiﬁcations. First,
phrasal verb construction (e.g. put away the toys) was added as a valid
frame because many English verbs co-occur with verb particles to form
distinct semantic units. Second, the adverb frame was excluded. Unlike
the noun phrase direct objects or the prepositional phrases, adverbs as a
syntactic category do not provide clues to the verb semantics. Naigles and
the adverb frame “has not been

hypothesized to correlate with verb meaning” (Naigles & Hoﬀ-Ginsberg,
, p. ). The broad frame coding therefore included: (a) transitivity
(i.e. followed immediately by a noun phrase direct object); (b) postverbal
and (d) verb–particle
sentence;
construction. Each target verb was then coded for its COMBINATION of
broad frames. For example, the verb put in the sentence put the box under
the chair would be coded as combining the transitivity frame and the
postverbal prepositional phrase frame. The target verb blow in the sentence

itself a unique frame combination. The coding scheme thus allowed

Similar to the analysis of syntactic frame diversity, the ratio of diﬀerent
morphological contexts to total verb tokens was computed for each target
verb. Each parent received an average ratio that reﬂected the diversity of
his/her ten most
frequently used verbs with diﬀerent morphological
contexts. See Hsu () for a detailed illustration for computing the
morphological context diversity.

Child developmental measures at ;. Several measures of children’s ;
developmental abilities were computed as potential predictors of the ;
verb diversity and to determine whether children’s language production
inﬂuenced concurrent properties of parent input in the ; language samples.
. Measures of vocabulary size. Two measures of children’s vocabulary size,
CDI total words and the number of diﬀerent words produced by children in
the language samples, were used. CDI total words reﬂected children’s overall
lexicon size as reported by their parents. The number of diﬀerent words

denoted the expressive lexicon size observed during the naturalistic
conversations during free play. The number of diﬀerent words was used to
investigate continuity in lexical development and the potential inﬂuence of
children’s vocabulary use on parent language input.

. The measure of talkativity and intelligibility. Children’s talkativity and
intelligibility was measured using the number of complete and intelligible
utterances produced in the -min language sample. Only spontaneous
utterances were included. Children’s imitations of the adult utterances
were not
included. Utterances such as singing, number counting, or
daily and game-playing routines (e.g. amen) were also excluded. We
hypothesized that children’s talkativity and intelligibility would be related
to the number of diﬀerent words they produced. In addition, it seemed
possible that parents might respond diﬀerently to children with limited
intelligibility, so we examined the inﬂuence of children’s number of
complete and intelligible utterances on parent input.

Child expressive verb diversity at ;. Children’s ; verb diversity was
measured by the number of diﬀerent verbs produced in the -min
language sample. For a word to be counted as a verb, it had to either belong
only to the verb category or be used in a context that granted the word verb
status. For example, the word put would be counted as a verb because it can
only be used as a verb. On the other hand, an appropriate verb context was
required for the word open to be counted as a verb in the child’s lexicon (cf.
I open the door [verb] vs. the door is open [adjective]). The ﬁrst author
examined all words that had the possibility to be used as other word classes.
All words counted as verbs were used in appropriate verb contexts.

Reliability
Transcribers completed approximately  hours of training. They were
required to complete three consecutive training transcripts at %
reliability overall before transcribing child data used in the analyses.
Transcription reliability was obtained through consensus procedures
designed to reduce measurement error and to err on the side of
conservative transcription whenever possible (Shriberg et al., ). The
consensus transcription procedures, previously described, provided the
transcription reliability for this study. These procedures were adopted
given the inherent diﬃculty in transcribing very young children’s speech,
consistent with the procedures of other investigators transcribing toddlers’
speech (e.g. Eisenberg, Guo & Germezia, ; Rescorla, Roberts &
Dahlsgaard, ; Theakston & Rowland, ).

The ﬁrst author was the primary coder for all parent verb measures at ;
and the children’s verb diversity at ;. To ensure high levels of coding
reliability, a graduate student research assistant with prior experience

coding verbs was trained on the study-speciﬁc procedures. Since the coding
schemes for verb-related structural cues were unique to this study, the
reliability coder completed three practice trials and received feedback on
any coding disagreements. The three practice trials were all above %
accuracy in both syntactic frame coding and morphological context coding.
When computing the agreement rate for syntactic frame coding,
the
original coding and the reliability coding had to have the same frame
for each parent
combinations to be counted as agreement. That

(i.e.
transitivity, postverbal sentence, postverbal prepositional phrase, and verb–

Three additional language samples were then coded independently (% of
the data). For all three samples, coding agreement on all measures exceeded
acceptable levels of reliability (i.e. % agreement). Agreement rates for
each measure follow: parent verb identiﬁcation (M = ·, SD = ·);
syntactic frame coding (M = ·, SD = ·); morphological context
coding (M = ·, SD = ·); child verb diversity (M = ·, SD = ·).

Analysis plan
First, Pearson correlation coeﬃcients were computed to explore the
relationships between children’s ; developmental abilities, parent ;
verb input measures, and children’s ; verb diversity. Results of the
correlational analyses served to answer the ﬁrst three research questions
and to identify developmental factors and verb input measures that were
potential predictors of children’s subsequent verb diversity.

A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to address the fourth
research question. This analysis investigated the unique contribution of
parent input to children’s verb diversity after controlling for children’s
developmental abilities. Children’s ; verb diversity was the outcome
variable. The predictor variables were entered in three blocks. Block 
included all measures of children’s ; developmental abilities to control
for children’s developmental diﬀerences at ;. Block  included measures
of ; parent verb input. Only input measures that were signiﬁcantly
correlated with children’s ; verb diversity were used as predictor
variables in the regression analysis. Gender was entered in Block  to
remove any spurious
relations between predictors and the outcome
variable that were inﬂuenced by gender.

who produced more intelligible utterances also used more diﬀerent words in
the conversational
language samples. In contrast, correlations were
not statistically signiﬁcant between the language sample measures and
children’s total lexicon size estimated by the parent report; however, the
correlation between the number of diﬀerent words and CDI total words
was in the predicted direction (r() = ·, p = ·).

To address the ﬁrst research question, we explored the continuity between
children’s ; measures with the measure of ; verb diversity. Both ;
vocabulary measures were signiﬁcantly correlated with the ; verb
diversity, CDI total words (r() = ·, p = ·), number of diﬀerent
words produced (r() = ·, p = ·). In addition,
the correlation
between the number of complete and intelligible utterances at ; and the
; verb diversity approached signiﬁcance (r() = ·, p = ·). In light
of these signiﬁcant correlations, children’s developmental abilities at ;
were associated with their verb diversity at ;. Therefore, it was necessary
to control for children’s prior development in the primary analysis to
identify the relative contribution of developmental and input factors to
children’s subsequent verb diversity.

The second research question explored if children’s developmental
inﬂuenced parents’ verb use. Correlations between the ;

measures of child vocabulary and talkativity and the measures of parent

signiﬁcant (see Table ), indicating that parents’ verb use was not directly
inﬂuenced by their children’s expressive vocabulary abilities or by their
talkativity during the parent–child interactions.

We then examined the relationships between the ; parent verb input and
children’s ; verb diversity. Pearson correlation coeﬃcients were computed
for the number of total verbs and the number of diﬀerent verbs produced by
parents in the -min free play, syntactic frame diversity and morphological
context diversity of the frequently used verbs, and children’s verb diversity
(see Table ). The number of total verbs and the number of diﬀerent verbs in
parent input correlated with each other (r() = ·, p = ·), indicating
that parents who produced more verbs also used more diﬀerent verbs.
However, only parents’ number of diﬀerent verbs in the input was
correlated with children’s ; verb diversity (r() = ·, p = ·);
parents’ total verbs was unrelated (r() = ·, p = ·). Input syntactic
frame diversity of

morphological context diversity (r() = ·, p < ·). Parents who used
the frequent verbs in more unique syntactic frames also employed more
diﬀerent morphological contexts. Interestingly, the number of total verbs
produced was negatively correlated with the syntactic frame diversity of
the frequently used verbs (r() = –·, p = ·). Parents who produced
more verbs appeared to be more repetitive in their use of the frequent
verbs, repeating this set of verbs in similar syntactic patterns.

A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to determine if parent
verb input explained additional variance in children’s ; verb diversity,
after controlling for children’s prior developmental abilities. Children’s ;
verb diversity was the outcome variable. Three developmental factors were
entered in Block : CDI total words, the number of diﬀerent words, and
the number of complete and intelligible utterances produced. Together,
the three ; developmental factors explained approximately % of the
variance in the ; verb diversity (R = ·, F(,) = ·, p = ·).
Next, the number of diﬀerent verbs produced by parents was entered in
Block , since it was the only input measure that had a signiﬁcant correlation
with children’s ; verb diversity. The addition of parent verb input
diversity resulted in a signiﬁcantly improved model (R change = ·,
F(,) = ·, p = ·; R = ·, F(,) = ·, p = ·). In this
model, the four predictor variables together explained % of the variance;
only the number of diﬀerent verbs produced by parents and children’s CDI
total words were signiﬁcant predictors. Finally, gender was entered in Block
 to control for potential spurious eﬀects inﬂuenced by gender. The addition
of gender did not improve the model (R change < ·, F(,) = ·,
p = ·), nor did it alter the signiﬁcant predictor variables. In addition,
semi-partial correlations were used to identify which predictor variables

ﬁnal model, the number of diﬀerent verbs produced by parents at ;
accounted for % of the variance in children’s ; diversity (t() = ·,
p = ·), and children’s CDI total words at ; accounted for an

degree of overlap between verbs that parents used at ; and those that
children used at ; diﬀered among the dyads, ranging from % to %
(M = %, SD = ·). In contrast, children’s number of diﬀerent words

The ﬁeld of language development has long recognized that language
learning is inﬂuenced by factors internal to the child as well as factors
external to the child, such as his or her linguistic environment. The
current study revisited this topic, presenting new empirical ﬁndings about
these two inﬂuences on children’s verb
the unique contribution of
acquisition. Parents’ ; verb input diversity predicted children’s ; verb
diversity, uniquely accounting for % of the variance. Evidence for
developmental continuity in children’s
lexical development was also
apparent, as children’s ; lexicon size predicted their verb diversity six
months later, explaining an additional % of the variance.

The current study builds upon the ﬁndings of prior research in children’s
lexical development (Hoﬀ & Naigles, ; Huttenlocher et al., , ;
Rowe, ) by uncovering evidence for input eﬀects speciﬁc to verb lexicon
development. As verb acquisition is a vital component
in language
development,
facilitates
children’s verb learning. The previous literature documents that both
input quantity and input diversity are important to lexical development at
diﬀerent ages (Huttenlocher et al., , ; Rowe, ), with input
diversity becoming more important than quantity by ;. Our ﬁndings
provide converging evidence for the importance of input diversity to verb
acquisition at an earlier point in development before the second birthday.

To better understand the kinds of verbs that parents with more diverse
verb lexicons were using, we examined which verbs were used by most
parents and which verbs were used by only a few. A total of  diﬀerent
verbs was produced collapsed across the twenty parents in the study, with
thirty-two verbs (%) used by more than half of the parents. Nine verbs
were produced by all parents: do, get, go, have, look, play, put, see, and
want, with most of them falling into the categories of the ‘light verbs’

proposed by Pinker () or the general all-purpose (GAP) verbs proposed
by Rice and Bode (). These verbs are frequent in input and are less
speciﬁc in meanings as they do not map to speciﬁc actions (Pinker, ;
Rice & Bode, ). The nine most
frequently used verbs in the
CHILDES database (Li & Shirai, ; MacWhinney, ) completely
overlapped with our parents’ most frequently used verbs. Only do and
have were not included in the CHILDES list of verbs. More than half of
our parents used common mental state verbs such as know, think, and like.
They also used verbs that were commonly associated with the speciﬁc
activities and materials in the playroom, including eat, feed, cook (kitchen
area), ﬁt (puzzles), blow (bubbles), and open (cabinets, toys in boxes with
lids).

Among the total of  verbs,  verbs (%) were used by ten or fewer
parents, and  verbs (%) were produced by only a single parent. Thus, the
input verb lexicon collapsed across parents consisted of a small number of
frequent verbs shared by most parents, with the vast majority of verbs
rarely produced, often by only a single parent. Although the verbs
produced by the majority of parents were mostly meaning-general, the
remaining % included verbs that were more speciﬁc in the manner or
the instrument encoded in the designated actions. Fewer parents used
verbs with more speciﬁc meanings. For example, the general movement
verb go was used  times by all
its
manner-speciﬁc counterparts such as walk, run, and step were produced by
fewer than six parents. Another example is the verb play. Play could be
used as a general action label for many diﬀerent activities and was used
 times by all twenty parents, yet verbs denoting more precise play
actions such as bounce, lift, and toss were used by fewer than three parents.
Similarly, the activity verb cook was more likely to be used in the kitchen
area of the playroom. It was produced  times by thirteen of the twenty
parents. In contrast, the more speciﬁc verbs such as stir, fry, and bake
were used by fewer than four parents. In summary, parents with more
diverse verb lexicons tended to expose their children to more meaning-
speciﬁc verbs,
children encountered these verbs
infrequently in the input. Nevertheless, exposure to more meaning-speciﬁc
verbs provided critical opportunities for children to increase their verb
lexicon size.

Of the developmental factors considered, children’s ; vocabulary size

diversity. This ﬁnding provides additional evidence for developmental
continuity in early language development (Bates, Bretherton & Snyder,
; Marchman & Thal, ), as the expansion of the verb lexicon starts
later compared to the rapid expansion of common nouns (Bates et al.,
). On the other hand, children’s talkativity and intelligibility at ;

input

did not predict their subsequent verb diversity. Children who were more
intelligible or more talkative were not necessarily more advanced in verb
development. Additionally, children’s ; developmental abilities did not
inﬂuence the concurrent parent
they received. No signiﬁcant
relationships were observed between measures of children’s vocabulary size
and talkativity with the parents’ verb input quantity, input diversity, or
verb-related structural diversity. Although the ﬁnding diﬀers
from
Huttenlocher et al.’s (), it should be noted that we restricted our
sample to children with a limited initial verb lexicon size. Thus, the
diﬀerence in ﬁndings may be attributable to a narrower range of children’s
vocabulary abilities in our sample as compared to Huttenlocher et al.’s
sample.

The study further tested the hypothesis that syntactic and morphological
diversity facilitate verb acquisition (de Villiers, ; Naigles & Hoﬀ-
Ginsberg, , ). Our coding scheme, adapted from Naigles and
Hoﬀ-Ginsberg (, ), better captured the notion of the syntactic
bootstrapping hypothesis. We counted the unique combinations of ‘broad
syntactic frames’, the frames considered to be cues to verb meanings,
whereas Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg used the ‘narrow syntactic frames’,
which do not translate into cues to verb meanings in an obvious manner
(Naigles & Hoﬀ-Ginsberg, , p. ). However, our input syntactic
frame diversity variable was not signiﬁcantly correlated with children’s
subsequent verb diversity, and hence was not included in the regression
analysis. Recall
that Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg used pooled speech
samples to examine the contribution of input structural cues to children’s
verb production. In contrast, we concentrated on the variation among
parents in their input structural diversity. The fact that there were no
signiﬁcant relations between input structural diversity and children’s
subsequent verb diversity suggested that either parents did not diﬀer
suﬃciently in their use of structural cues with frequent verbs, or the
variability that was apparent did not contribute to children’s verb
diversity. It should also be noted that Naigles and Hoﬀ-Ginsberg’s
measure of input structural diversity explained only % of the additional
variance in child verb frequency, after controlling for the parent input
verb frequency. Insofar as the current study examined variability in a
small sample of individual parent–child dyads (n = ) and not variability
in the use of verbs within a language for a large pooled sample of many
more dyads (n = ), the absence of a signiﬁcant eﬀect for the structural
cues may not be particularly surprising. Future research is needed to
reconcile the diﬀerence between these two approaches to characterize
structural cue diversity in input and its eﬀect on verb acquisition.

This study also made use of a valuable methodological technique for
exploring the impact of parent input on individual diﬀerences in toddlers’

language development. Following the design of Huttenlocher et al. ()
and Rowe () for initial vocabulary development, and Hadley, Rispoli,
Fitzgerald, and Bahnsen () for initial morphosyntactic development,
we selected children to be homogeneous in age and developmental status.
Developmental diﬀerences in verb lexicon size at the initial measurement
point were also controlled, selecting children with ten or fewer verbs on
the CDI. If developmental diﬀerences had been too extensive at the initial
measurement point, the eﬀects of developmental continuity could have
overpowered the contribution of parent input. In addition, since parents
may adjust their input to their children’s level of lexical development
(Huttenlocher et al., ), homogeneity in the target variable across the
child participants also minimized diﬀerences in parent input that could be
inﬂuenced by children’s vocabulary abilities. Despite the homogeneity in
children’s initial verb lexicons, the parent input remained variable. As a
result, we were able to isolate the contribution of input diversity to
subsequent between-child diﬀerences in verb diversity. In contrast, the
child participants
study were more
heterogeneous. Hoﬀ and Naigles investigated input eﬀects on lexical
development using children who were approximately ;. They selected
children who “were just beginning to combine words”, and examined the
relationship between Time  input and Time  children’s lexicon size ten
weeks later. However, the child participants varied both in age and lexicon
size at Time . Hoﬀ and Naigles did not ﬁnd input lexical diversity to be
a signiﬁcant predictor of children’s subsequent lexicon size. Given the
developmental diﬀerences between children at Time , it is possible that
the developmental diﬀerences overrode the input eﬀect. On the other
hand, the current study was limited by the use of an archival database.
Ideally, we would have initiated this study at ;, when nearly all children
might be expected to have small expressive verb vocabularies. Because the
initial measurement point in the archival database was at ;, we had to
restrict our child participants
to those with small expressive verb
vocabularies to reduce initial developmental diﬀerences. This decision
resulted in a sample of children drawn from the low to average range of
verb acquisition (Dale & Fenson, ; Hadley, Rispoli & Hsu, in press)
and a gender imbalance of ﬁfteen boys and ﬁve girls. Replication of this
study, beginning at an earlier point in development, will be important to
determine the extent to which characteristics of the child participants may
have inﬂuenced our ﬁndings.

()

In light of Rowe’s () ﬁndings, future studies should also be designed
to determine whether diﬀerent input characteristics contribute to children’s
verb diversity in diﬀerent developmental periods. Given our observation that
parents who had a more diverse verb lexicon tended to expose their children
to more semantically speciﬁc verbs, future studies are needed to understand

factors that may inﬂuence the diversity and sophistication of the parent input
verb lexicon. Potential factors such as parents’ general education level, verbal
ability, and joint engagement in play activities are worth exploring.

In closing, the current study showed that parent verb input diversity at ;
had a signiﬁcant impact on children’s subsequent verb diversity six months
later, even after accounting for developmental continuity in early lexical
development. Although a suﬃcient amount of parent input is essential
early in children’s lexical development (Huttenlocher et al., , ), a
diverse parent input verb lexicon with more semantically speciﬁc verbs
appears to be a crucial factor for enhancing toddler’s verb acquisition
between ; and ;.
