The present study reports on a developmental and cross-linguistic study
of oral narratives produced by speakers of Zulu (a Bantu language) and
French (a Romance language). Speciﬁcally, we focus on oral narrative
performance as a bimodal (i.e.,
linguistic and gestural) behaviour
during the late language acquisition phase. We analyzed seventy-two
oral narratives produced by L Zulu and French adults and primary
school children aged between ﬁve and ten years old. The data were all
collected using a narrative retelling task. The results revealed a strong
eﬀect of age on discourse performance, conﬁrming that narrative
abilities improve with age,
irrespective of language. However, the
results also showed cross-linguistic diﬀerences. Zulu oral narratives
were longer, more detailed, and accompanied by more co-speech
gestures than the French narratives. The parallel eﬀect of age and
language on gestural behaviour
is discussed and highlights the

importance of studying oral narratives from a multimodal perspective
within a cross-linguistic framework.

I N T R O D U C T I O N
This study investigates narrative development from a multimodal perspective
of a less-studied language, Zulu, a Bantu language spoken in South Africa, and
compares this development to a Romance language, French. We explore
similarities and diﬀerences of narrative ability from (i) a developmental and
(ii) a cross-linguistic perspective in a comparison of these linguistically
non-related languages.

Most

literature on the development of pragmatic ability usually
investigates one modality – speech. Several studies have shown evidence
that during face-to-face and verbal communication, a speaker or listener
integrates information from both auditory and visual sources into a single
message (Beattie, ; Beattie & Shovelton, ; Kendon, , ;
Kita & Özyürek, , McNeill, ). Oral narrative performance
includes auditory (linguistic signals and prosody) and visual (gesture)
information. However, the way that people integrate speech and gesture
into their narrative behaviour is highly dependent on language and culture
(Colletta et al., ).

The oral narrative from a multimodal perspective
Speakers usually organize experiences and memories of human happenings in
the form of a narrative (Berman, ; Bruner, ; Peterson & McCabe,
). The narrative format is conventional, culturally transmitted, and
restricted by each individual user’s level of mastery. Fayol () explains
that from a cognitive perspective in order to understand a narrative, a listener
must construct a mental model of a situation to facilitate comprehension of
that situation. In terms of language production, the construction of an
original story is a complex and demanding process involving planning and
organizing ideas beyond the sentence level as well as self-regulation of
formulation and presuppositional capacities, i.e., pragmatic skills (Hadley &
Schuele, ; Moonsamy, Jordaan & Greenop, ). Thus, to narrate a
story requires the integration of several abilities. In addition to linguistic
diﬃculties, it presents a more cognitive challenge of developing the contents
in hierarchically ordered sequential structures.

Available research on narrative abilities mainly focuses on one dimension,
the verbal dimension (oral or written), and the dimension of gesture is yet to
be included to produce a better understanding of the contextualization of
language knowledge and development. Over the past thirty years, research
on gesture and its relation to speech points to the multimodal nature of

is

(, )

Whilst there is no consensus of what could be a ‘universal’ classiﬁcation of
gestures (for examples see Guidetti, Fibigerova & Colletta, ), the one
proposed by McNeill
a heuristic one. Speakers
spontaneously produce gestures that are directly linked to speech and the
verbal message content. Co-speech gestures appear
to have multiple
functions: on the one hand, they convey information to the interlocutor
(Alibali, Kita & Young, ; Goldin-Meadow & Butcher, ; Kendon,
, ; McNeill, ), and on the other hand, they seem to fulﬁl
some cognitive functions; i.e., some studies suggest that gestures also serve a
purpose for speakers to access the mental lexicon in spontaneous speech (de
Ruiter, ; Krauss, Chen & Chawla, ). Some referential gestures
(pointing and representational gestures) are used to indicate the referent and
represent objects and ideas (Alibali et al., ; McNeill, ). Other
‘pragmatic’ gestures help the speaker express his/her immediate intentions,
mental states, and feelings (Kendon, ). They help frame the utterance
by expressing its illocutionary force. They also help to structure the
discourse production at various levels from sentence components, such as
the syllable or word, to discourse components, such as the thesis and its
arguments, or when retelling and commenting during a narrative (see
Kendon, , for a comprehensive review of the functions of gesture). All
in all, research on gesture has demonstrated the multimodal nature of
face-to-face and verbal communication. A speaker or listener integrates
auditory and acoustic (linguistic, prosodic) and visual (gesture) information
into a single message (Beattie, ; Beattie & Shovelton, ; Kendon,
, ; Kita & Özyürek, ; McNeill, ).

Due to their functional polyvalence, co-speech gestures play a large part in
the communicative process (Colletta, ; Kendon, ; McNeill, ).
The speaker has the opportunity to re-enact, to recount, and to comment
while using the correct
to ensure coherence and
cohesion. For instance, depending on the discourse context, gesticulation
can substitute for the verbal message, modulate it, or make it more
precise. In a narrative, gesture takes the role of ‘voice’ (i.e., narrative
focus) and can thus determine the perspective and level of narration.
Gesture has the capacity to highlight what is important in the context of
discourse and what is not.

rather,

i.e.,

they produce script-like stories,

sentential
level, as well as knowledge of the pragmatic properties of
well-formed discourse (Hickmann, ). The ability to produce coherent
narrative texts develops in parallel with the increase in cognitive and
linguistic skills of the child (Berman, , ; Berman & Slobin,
). For instance, children younger than ﬁve years rarely produce causal
chain sequences;
short
prototypical action sequences such as the ones children spontaneously act
in free play (mummy feeding baby, teacher teaching child, doctor nursing
patient, etc.). Older children start to verbalize chained sequences of actions
they merely
as they appear in the event or story they recount; yet
juxtapose facts until
(Fayol, ).
Considering the pragmatic heterogeneity of oral narratives (Labov, ;
Laforest, ; McNeill, ), telling a story also involves backtracking
in the event frame. For example, when retelling a complex event, the
narrator may not follow the order of events as they originally appeared and
may have to mark every break he is making in the narrative thread during
narration. Moreover, narrating can be viewed as a complex discourse
behaviour involving ‘metadiscourse’ in the form of personal commentary
(explicitation, explanation, and evaluation in the form of personal
judgement (Labov, ; Laforest, ; Peterson & McCabe, ). In
this way, a narrator can incorporate his/her own experience shaped by his/
her social and cultural experience, as well as other factors such as literacy.

the age of nine to ten years

By the age of ten, the child has not yet fully acquired complex discursive
skills such as organizing text on both the ‘narrative’
level and the
‘metadiscourse’, i.e., ‘meta-narrative’ and ‘para-narrative’ levels (Colletta,
; McNeill, ). Here the narrative level refers to the account of
events while the meta-narrative level refers to structuring the story during
its narration by the speaker and the para-narrative level refers to the
inclusion of personal experience and references linking the narrators to
their narratives. Becoming a competent narrator is a prolonged process
that extends into the school years due to the multiple, embedded demands
which include (i) the mastery of diﬀerent skills in the cognitive domain
(Karmiloﬀ-Smith, ) and (ii) knowing about the speciﬁc devices each
language has “in order to regulate the distinction between new and given
information” (Carmiol & Sparks, , p. ).

As they develop their narrative skills, children are faced with several
challenges, such as having to produce coherent, cohesive (structured) units
of extended discourse; they need to understand that their audience may
not share the same knowledge about
the events they themselves are
speaking about; and children also have to incorporate the possibility that
the listener may not interpret the events that are being told in the same
way (Hymes, ; Ninio & Snow, ). Therefore, the path from
becoming a native speaker to a proﬁcient speaker of any given language is

a long developmental trajectory (Berman, , ; Berman & Slobin,
; Hickmann, ), and children in primary school would not be
expected to have completed the process from emergence to mastery. Most
of the literature on the role of gestures and speech focuses either on the
early acquisition period from birth to three years old (see Capirci, Iverson,
Pizzuto & Volterra, ; Goldin-Meadow & Butcher, ; Guidetti,
, ) or on adults (Beattie, ; Kendon, ; Kita & Özyürek,
, ; Loehr, ). Studying the role of gesture in the early
acquisition period and the adult competency does not inform us on the
development of co-speech gesture, which happens to occur gradually and
developmentally. However, some studies (Colletta, ; Colletta, Pellenq
& Guidetti, ; Graziano, ; Kunene, ) have shown that the
production of gesture develops with age: the older the child, the more
gesture becomes varied and specialized during discourse as it gradually
becomes similar to adult usage.

Cross-linguistic research on oral narratives
There is little or no literature that explores the development of narrative
ability in Zulu- speaking children. Current and existing literature on
South African Bantu languages focuses on various aspects of linguistic
competency, such as the acquisition of the passive construction (Demuth,
; Suzman, ) or the acquisition of the noun class system (Gxilishe,
) in early language acquisition (until the age of about four years).

Current literature on gesture and narrative development focuses mostly on
Romance and Germanic languages, Japanese, and Turkish (Colletta, ;
Graziano, ; Kita & Özyürek, ), so that there is little or no
information on gesture development in any African language, including the
Bantu language family. This lack of literature motivated the present study.
Several studies have shown that culture places limitations on language
forms in many aspects, such as the conventionalized forms of interpersonal
interaction and the use and form of speech acts (Gumperz, ; Saville-
Troike, ). Consequently,
in order to use language competently,
children have to use the semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic conventions of
interactions (Carmiol & Sparks, ).
their communities for social
Culture also shapes non-verbal aspects of communication,
including
ritualized acts (Loehr, ), the use of facial expressions (Ekman &
Friesen, ), conventional gestural forms (Brookes, , ; Kendon,
; Morris, ), and co-speech gestures (Allen et al., ; Kendon,
; Kita, ; Kita & Özyürek, ; McNeill, ), as well as
semantic distinctions in placement verbs depending on the language
(Gullberg & Narasimhan, ). For example, Kendon (, )
compared Neapolitan gesture and British gesture practices in which he

examined the Neapolitan’s preference for using gestures more frequently
than the British, as well as using them as an exclusive mode of
communication. The strong implication is that through socialization, a
child acquires and masters these non-verbal resources along with the

the French children produced longer
narratives, while the Italian children gestured more than their French and
American counterparts. However, despite other minor diﬀerences, the

detailed narratives than their younger counterparts: they inserted more

The narrative in Zulu and French
Zulu is an agglutinative polymorphemic language, that is, a language with
aﬃxes attached to the root or core of the word and a complex nominal class
system (Pretorius & Bosch, ). French is a Romance language, and, unlike
Zulu, it is an analytic language. French grammar is characterized by a
two-way gender distinction: masculine or feminine. In terms of syntactic
diﬀerences, French requires an explicit
subject, whereas Zulu is a
NULL-SUBJECT (or PRO-DROP) language, such as Italian and Spanish, and does
not require an explicit subject once the referent has been introduced initially.

The cultural aspects are not the main focal point of this study; however, it is
not easy to divorce the manner in which narratives are produced in an oral
culture compared with a written culture, as this informs on the narrative
strategy a speaker uses. It is important to give a brief overview of the
cultural aspects that have a direct link with the narrative performance in
this study. Zulu is a language with a long oral tradition that only became a
written language in the nineteenth century. Information, culture, and
education were transmitted through oral narratives and performance

(Groenewald, ; Ramaila, ). The oral tradition is still present, and
story-telling plays a very important role in Zulu culture. Children hear
tales from their caregivers before going to bed as well as during the day.
Suzman (, p. ) noted “distinctive features of adults speech style in
talking to children . . . were found primarily on the discourse level”
amongst the Zulu participants of her study. Oral folklore requires a
participative audience, and the story-teller mimics roles to allow the tale to
be as imagistic and realistic as possible. This tradition, also shared by other
Bantu cultures, can be traced to contemporary South Africa. Oration is still
a complex system in which long-term wisdom is transmitted through
dramatized, narrated, and sung folklore to children from the early stages of
their development (Ramaila, ).

The French language, on the other hand, has a long written history that dates
back to the ﬁfteenth century. As the written mode has existed for a long time,
reliance on oral story-telling is far less important than for an oral tradition
language such as Zulu. In contrast to Zulu society, in most instances when
French children go to bed at night, their caregivers will read them a story
from a picture-book. The culture of la lecture partagée is favoured especially
in middle-class families. Reading a child a night-time story from a book is
highly preferred, not only for the images that are pleasing to children, but
also to prepare the child for entry to the world of reading and writing (Frier,
). Teachers who narrate from a book mostly concentrate on reading and
on showing, as well as commenting on the book’s pictures (Grossmann,
); few of them actually give an oral narration comparable to story-telling
performance in Bantu and other orature-based cultures.

As a result of these diﬀerences in cultural practices, narrative production
should exhibit culture-speciﬁc patterns (Hendriks, ; Hickmann, ).

and (ii) with age, there will be increased gesture use, and amongst these
gestures we expect to observe more cohesive and framing gestures. These
expectations are based on previous results on narratives produced by
children and adults (Colletta et al., , ). We also expect to ﬁnd a
similar developmental trajectory in both language groups, which would
conﬁrm the developmental pattern of
textual and monologic abilities
(Berman, ; Berman & Slobin, ).

From a cross-linguistic perspective, as a result of oral culture (mentioned
above), we expect Zulu children to deliver longer, hence more detailed,
accounts of the story than French children. In gestural production, we
expect to see more gestures in the Zulu narratives compared to the French
narratives: the longer and more detailed the verbal narrative, the more
co-speech gestures would be present in the narrative performance.

In the type of gestural production, we expect to see more representational
gestures (which are a part of referential gestures as explained above) in the
Zulu narratives compared with French, because of linguistic diﬀerences. In
Zulu, due to its agglutinative nature, the role of chronological connectives
has a double function: that of cohesion and coherence (linking clauses), as
well as
reference tracking. Given the inter-relationship between
utterances and contextual information, gesture introduction and tracking of
reference reﬂect cross-linguistic diﬀerences in speech and could lead to a
higher level of gesture production.

Participants
A total of seventy-two mother-tongue Zulu- and French-speaking children
aged ﬁve and ten years old (see the distribution of participants’ ages and
ranges in Table ) and adults participated in this study: thirty-six Zulu
and thirty-six French speakers. There was an equal gender split. The child
participants were selected from the school grades corresponding to their
age, and all
the adults were university students who volunteered to
participate in the study. Participants came from schools and universities in
Grenoble and Toulouse (France) and in Empangeni, Kwa-Zulu Natal
(South Africa).

Procedure
The participants watched a video extract ( minutes and  seconds) of a
wordless cartoon taken from the series Tom & Jerry. They individually
watched this same video twice, and were then instructed to tell the story
to the interviewer (for more details on this protocol, see Colletta et al.,
, ; Reig Alamillo, Colletta & Guidetti, ). The participants’
narratives were videotaped for later analysis.

The cartoon starts with a mother bird leaving her egg in the nest. The egg
accidentally falls out and rolls into Jerry’s house. The egg hatches in Jerry’s
house and a baby woodpecker emerges. The baby bird then starts damaging
Jerry’s furniture. After a few failed attempts to calm the bird down, Jerry
gets angry and decides to put the bird back in its nest.

Filming of the children was conducted at school but out of the classroom
environment. Filming of the adults was conducted in university classrooms
or students’ residences.

Coding
The data transcription and annotation were performed using the linguistic
annotation tool ELAN software (tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/). Coding was
done on the verbal and gestural
levels. An annotation scheme specially
designed for this type of study (Colletta, Kunene, Venouil, Kaufmann &
Simon, ) provided information on syntax,
lexicon, discourse, and
co-speech gesture. Speech turns were transcribed orthographically, including
each word, pause, repetition, or hesitation on the software. Hesitations,
pauses, and word errors were coded using the coding conventions from the
annotation scheme cited above,
there was a vocalic
lengthening, two semicolons /::/ would be placed on the lengthened syllable).
Speech transcription for the Zulu was coded by L speakers of Zulu and
then veriﬁed by an independent second coder, also an L speaker of that
language. For the French speech coding, reliability in transcription of the
children’s words was established by three independent coders, all L
speakers of French.

turns, clauses, words, syntactic structures, and macro-structural episodes
of the narrative event, to measure discursive ability in line with the
stimulus presented to the speaker. Based on Berman and Slobin (),
a ‘clause’ included a predicate matched by one or more arguments. The
following were considered single clauses (example from a nine-year-old
Zulu boy):

() kuneqanda lapha phakathi

expl-have-N-egg here inside
‘There is an egg inside’

() yase ipopayi . . . yathatha lela thawula

sbj-cons-then N-cartoon.character N-cons-take PAST that.pos.cl
towel
‘and then the cartoon character took that towel’

Using clauses in the analysis provided us with an indication of its
informational quantity (“relative length and propositional complexity of
the texts”; Berman & Slobin (, p. ) across the whole narrative
sample. Coded clauses excluded repetitions.

To determine the macrostructure of the narrative, we categorized each
clause related to the narrative activity of the stimulus, according to the
discourse or pragmatic speech act it expressed. Four types of pragmatic
speech acts were identiﬁed (for a detailed description of the coding, see
Colletta et al., , , ) as expressing the part or whole of a
speech act: narrating, explaining, interpreting, or commenting:

a. Narration (narrative level; McNeill, ) – when the speaker tells the
event such as it happens in cartoon (e.g., “There was a mother bird in
the nest”).

b. Explanation (non-narrative level; Reig Alamillo et al., ) – when the
speaker explains the cause of an event (e.g., “The mother bird left the
nest because it was hungry”).

c. Interpretation (non-narrative level; Reig Alamillo et al., ) – when the
speaker presents an inference or an interpretation concerning the situation
or the intentions of the characters (e.g., “It looked at the time and realises
it’s time to fetch food”).

d. Commentary (non-narrative level; Reig Alamillo et al., ) – when the
speaker presents information that is neither explicit nor implicit about
the course of the narrative events, but presents either a ‘meta-narrative’
comment relating to a character, an action, or any aspect of the story, or
a ‘para-narrative’ comment relating to the action of telling the story,
such as a judgement or personal appreciation (e.g., “It is a crazy bird” or
“It made me laugh when the little bird destroyed everything in the
house”).

Gesture coding
For gesture coding, only the bodily movements maintaining a relation to
speech (co-speech gestures) were annotated. Coders ﬁrst
identiﬁed a
gesture and then attributed a function to it. The coders had to choose
among the following categories:

a. Representational

(corresponds to iconic and metaphoric gestures in
McNeill, ) – hand or facial gesture, associated or not with other
parts of the body, which represents an object or a property of this
object, a place, a trajectory, an action, a character, or an attitude (e.g.,
two hands drawing the form of the referent; hand or head gesture
pointing to a spot that locates a virtual character or object in frontal
space; hand or head moving in some direction to represent
the
trajectory of the referent; two hands or body mimicking an action), or
which symbolizes, by metaphor or metonymy, an abstract idea (e.g.,
hand or head movement towards the left or the right to symbolize the
past or the future; gesture metaphors for abstract concepts).

b. Performative gesture (part of pragmatic gestures; Kendon, ) which
allows the gestural realization of a speech act (e.g., head nod as a ‘yes’
answer, head shake as a ‘no’ answer), or which co-expresses, together
with the verbal utterance, the illocutionary value of a speech act (e.g.,
head nod accompanying a ‘yes’ answer).

c. Framing gesture (part of pragmatic gestures; Kendon, ) that expresses
an emotional or mental state of the narrator (e.g., face showing amusement
to express the comical side of an event; shoulder shrug or facial expression
of doubt to express incertitude of what is being asserted).

d. Discursive gesture (part of pragmatic gestures; Kendon, ; and
cohesion gestures in McNeill, ) aids in structuring speech and
discourse by the accentuation or highlighting of certain linguistic units
(e.g., beat gestures: rhythmic movements that do not present an explicit
meaning but serve for emphasis accompanying a certain word; repeated
beats accompanying stressed syllables), or marks discourse cohesion by
linking clauses or discourse units (e.g., brief hand gesture or beat
accompanying a connective; pointing gesture with an anaphoric
function such as pointing to a spot to refer to a character or an object
previously referred to and assigned to this spot).

e. Interactive gesture accompanied by gaze towards the listener to express
that the speaker requires or veriﬁes his attention, or shows that he has
reached the end of his speech turn or his narrative, or towards the
speaker to show his own attention (e.g., nodding head while interlocutor
speaks).

f. Word-searching gestures or ‘Butterworths’ (McNeill, ) – a hand
gesture or facial expression which indicates that the speaker is searching

for a word or expression (e.g., frowning, staring above, and tapping of
ﬁngers while searching for words).

Gesture transcription reliability
In order to establish reliability in gesture coding, two separate coders
identiﬁed the gestures and attributed a function to each one. Gestures
were also coded in terms of their relationship to speech. A third coder
validated their annotations and settled any disagreements. Inter-rater
agreement was % on gesture identiﬁcation and coding.

Data analysis
This narrative elicitation task sought to identify the developmental trajectory
of discursive ability of two languages, French and Zulu. This analysis is
based on the two types of communicative behaviour, speech and gesture.

(narration, commentary,

The independent variables were language and age, while the dependent
variables were narrative length (the number of clauses), type of pragmatic
speech act
interpretation, explanation), and
gesture, which included the number of gestures and the type of gesture
(representational, discursive, framing). Other types of gestures such as
performative, word searching, and interactive were excluded as they had a
low frequency of occurrence in this narrative task.

The analysis of gender and the length of narratives failed to reach
signiﬁcance for the combined French and Zulu data. There was also no
interaction between language and gender. All
statistical
analyses were therefore performed across both genders. To answer the
questions on the eﬀect of age and language across the French and Zulu
data, we performed ANOVAs with age and language as between-subject
factors. For each of our variables we tested for the eﬀect of age, the eﬀect
of language, and the interaction between age and language. The following
section reports the statistically signiﬁcant results.

story as a measure of the narratives’ lengths. Clauses that repeated the same
information were excluded.

The mean number of clauses showed an overall eﬀect of age (F(,) = ·,
p < ·); however, the eﬀect of language was more a tendency than a
signiﬁcant result (F(,) = ·, p = ·); and the interaction between the
factors was not signiﬁcant. The post-hoc Bonferroni test showed that
the ﬁve-year-old group produced narratives signiﬁcantly shorter than the
ten-years-olds (p = ·) and the adults (p = ·), but narratives of the
ten-year-olds were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of the adults. A
similar pattern was observed across language groups with regard to narrative
development: with age, narrative information increases in both French and Zulu.
However, between the ages, there was a cross-linguistic diﬀerence; for
instance, for the French children, the post-hoc Bonferroni test showed that
the ﬁve-year-olds produced narratives
than the
ten-year-olds (p = ·). The number of clauses in the ten-year-olds’
narratives was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the French adults. On the
other hand, in the Zulu data, there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the mean
number of clauses between the ﬁve-year-olds and the adults (p = ·), but
there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the ﬁve-year-olds’ and the
ten-year-olds’ productions, unlike in the French data. As in the results for
French data, the length of the ten-year-olds’ Zulu narratives was not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that of the Zulu adults.

signiﬁcantly shorter

For the narrative complexity measure, we examined the type of clauses in
terms of pragmatic speech acts to see how the children were able to navigate
through the narrative and meta-narrative levels. The pragmatic speech acts
were categorized as narrative, commentary, explanatory, and interpretative
(see Table  for results).

The results indicate that the pragmatic type of clause with the highest
representation is the narrative clause, which is consistent with the language
task. Clauses categorized as commentary, explanatory, and interpretative
were fewer in number, but their distribution over the two languages was
diﬀerent.

An ANOVA was conducted with two between-subject factors to test for
the eﬀect of language and age as well as to determine if there was an
interaction of the pragmatic type of clause between the two variables.
There was an eﬀect of age (F(,) = ·, p = ·) as well as of language
(F(,) = ·, p = ·), but there was no interaction between the two
factors. This means that the association of the two independent variables
of language and age did not aﬀect the development of the narrative type of
clause.

younger children produced fewer narrative clauses than the ten-year-olds in
both languages (Table ). The ten-year-olds’ narrative clause results were
diﬀerent per language. For the French children, the ten-year-olds had a
higher mean number of narrative clauses than the French adults by %
(Table ), whereas for the Zulu data, the ten-year-olds produced fewer
narrative clauses (mean number ·) than the Zulu adults (mean number
·).

While the highest frequency was, naturally, the narrative clause for both
language groups, there is a cross-linguistic diﬀerence in the distribution of
the type of clause. The Zulu speakers had a higher frequency of narrative
clauses than the French speakers, and conversely, the French speakers had
a higher number of non-narrative clauses (or clauses that moved away
from the narrative level or relating the event as it occurred) which were
characterized by more commentaries, explanations, and interpretation
during the narrative task (see Table ), than their Zulu counterparts.

Furthermore, closer inspection of the two language groups showed that
the development of the narrative type of clause happens in parallel in both
languages, French (F(,) = ·, p = ·) and Zulu (F(,) = ·,
p = ·), but was not similar in every respect. The post-hoc Bonferroni
tests showed that for the French corpus, the ﬁve-year-olds produced fewer
narrative clauses than the ten-year-olds (p = ·), and the ten-year-olds
were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the adults (p = ·), producing more
narrative clauses. In the linguistic analysis, the number of narrative clauses
for the older children and the adults revealed fewer blow-by-blow
accounts of the story (detailed accounts that try to enact the narrative as
seen from the stimulus), as they summarized more than the younger
children, who tended to give a more of an event-by-event recounting of
the narrative.

A similar trend was observed in both language groups between younger

children, older children, and adults.

Gesture rate. The Zulu speakers produced more clauses and gesture strokes
than their French counterparts. Comparing the mean numbers of gesture
strokes for the two languages did not give an accurate reﬂection of the
similarities or diﬀerences because some people produced a lot of gestures
and others did not. Consequently, we calculated the gesture rate or the
number of gestures per clause to give a clearer picture of the gestural
results with respect to speech. The gesture rate was calculated by counting
the number of gestures and dividing it by the number of clauses used per
participant (see Table ).

In contrast, a slight diﬀerence was observed for the Zulu group. The Zulu
adult speakers produced signiﬁcantly more gestures than both the ﬁve- and

In terms of cross-linguistic diﬀerences, as predicted, the Zulu speakers
produced more gestures than the French speakers. The Zulu speakers
produced ·% more clauses than the French, which resulted in %
additional gestures (see Table ). There was an interaction between
language and age (F(,) = ·, p = ·) between the two language
groups as the narrative behaviour was not similar: Zulu adults produced
more gestures than their French counterparts.

Type of gesture. The types of gesture produced were analyzed according to
age and language, with a focus on representational and non-representational
gesture types,
interactive, word searching, and discursive
gestures. Of the non-representational gestures, the two most frequently
produced types were the discursive and the framing gestures. These types
of gesture are directly involved with the narrative activity in their role as
discourse cohesive and framing devices, whereas the interactive and
word-searching gestures aid with the performance of dialogue (see Table ).
the
non-representational gestures (i.e., gestures helping to structure speech or
mark cohesion) had a higher frequency in the French data. This result is
consistent with the analysis of the types of clauses, and suggests that the
Zulu speakers place a lot more emphasis on the narrative type of clause
than the non-narrative type of clause.

Representational gesture. Taking all groups together, there was an age eﬀect
(F(,) = ., p < ·), a language eﬀect (F(,) = ., p < ·), and
an interaction between the two factors (F(,) = ., p = ·) for all
representational gestures. Post-hoc Bonferroni tests showed that the adults
produced signiﬁcantly more representational gestures than the ﬁve- and
ten-year-olds
respectively). There was also a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the groups of children, with the ten-year-olds
producing signiﬁcantly more representational gestures (p = ·) than the
ﬁve-year-olds. The interaction between the two factors showed that Zulu
adults performed more representational gestures than all other groups.

p = ·, respectively) (see Figure ).

The adults, and especially the Zulu adults, produced a higher number of
representational gestures than the groups of children (see Figure ). This
development is better understood when the non-representational gestures
are also considered, as in the following section.

Non-representational gestures. French gesture production includes a higher
number of discursive (cohesive) and framing gestures when compared to the
Zulu speakers. When these non-representational gesture rates (discursive and
framing) are regrouped, it provides a clearer picture of how cohesive and
framing discourse cues were represented in the two languages and across
the diﬀerent age groups (see Figure ).

On all non-representational gesture rates,

language groups produced signiﬁcantly more non-representational gestures
than the ﬁve- and ten-year-olds (p < · and p < ·, respectively).
French speakers produced more than Zulu speakers.

G E N E R A L D I S C U S S I O N
Our study investigated the developmental trajectory of multimodal oral
narratives of Zulu and French speakers. Our hypotheses were that, with
age, narratives increase in length and complexity irrespective of language.
We also hypothesized that there is a parallel increase of co-speech gesture
use, which also becomes more complex as the child gets older. Amongst
these co-speech gestures, we expected to observe more cohesive and
framing gestures increasing with age.

Eﬀects of age on narratives
Similar diﬀerences occurred in both language groups between younger
children, older children, and adults. Interestingly,
these diﬀerences
appeared in the gesture aspects of narrative behaviour as well as in the
length and the pragmatics of narratives.

Adults and older children produced longer narratives with a higher
number of narrative and non-narrative clauses than the younger children
in both languages (Zulu and French); the ﬁve-year-olds would give longer
and more detailed narratives as they tried to give a full account of the
event sequence, trying to recount all they remembered, while the adults
used several pragmatic devices to produce a more compact narrative. This
comparative study provides further evidence to support
the previous
ﬁndings of Colletta () for French and Graziano () for Italian, that
narrative development improves gradually with age,
irrespective of the
language.

Previous studies on the development of summary and implicit language
abilities have showed that children do not fully master the ability of
summarizing stories until later than nine years of age (Colletta et al., ;
Fayol, ). Yet the summarizing pattern appeared in the group of

French adults, but not in the group of Zulu adults. To further explore this
diﬀerence, more child data is required, such as a twelve-year-old cohort in
both Zulu and French to observe when the child’s production is closer to
adult narrative production.

Eﬀects of age on gestural production
In both language groups, the adults produced more gestures than the two
groups of children, and the groups of older children produced more
gestures than the groups of younger children. However, both language
groups diﬀered in the type of gestures they used. The ten-year-old Zulu
children’s gesture production was signiﬁcantly less than the adults’. Yet the
type of gestures they produced was more representational, which showed
that the Zulu children are developing their ability to make their interlocutor
visualize what is said during the narrative event. The ten-year-old French
children’s gesture production was also signiﬁcantly less than the adults’
performance. Yet they produced more pragmatic gestures than the group of
younger children, and the adults produced a signiﬁcantly higher number of
non-representational gestures than both the groups of children. For age

Moreover, despite the language and culture diﬀerences we report here, our

Young children in the ﬁrst year of primary school, who are typically more

production of narrating a story a diﬃcult
task, and produce short
narratives with no great detail. When they do gesture, they try to represent
characters and events.

Older children on the way to secondary school have developed narrative
abilities that can be seen in the length of their linguistic production as well
as in their linguistic and gesture content. They perform the narrative

along with an increasing use of co-speech gesture to represent and track
the characters from the story and to enliven the events. Their gesture
repertoire includes discursive gestures that mark discourse progression and
framing gestures that express personal feelings towards the story and
connote the content of speech.

Although the narrative performance of a ten-year-old child remains
drastically diﬀerent from that of an adult, it begins to show some of the
same features and particularities grounded in cultural expectations and
norms
is where culture and
socializing come into play. As this study shows, the narratives of older
children, heading towards secondary school, clearly introduce orientations
that reﬂect – in terms of both gesture and speech – speciﬁcities of literacy,
which are embedded in social practice and representations of story-telling.
Their narrative performance, although not yet comparable to an adult’s,
seems in line with the usual narrative performance displayed by adults
who belong to the same language group.

Eﬀects of language on narrative production
As predicted, the Zulu participants produced longer narratives compared to
the French participants. The Zulu speakers favoured a detailed and an
event-by-event account, whereas the French speakers produced a higher
number of non-narrative clauses and favoured more synthetic and
summarized accounts in their story-telling. In our view, the diﬀerence in
the narrative performance of the two language groups has to do with
culture and literacy acquisition, and may be attributed to the perception of
the task. In the Zulu language, telling a story entails performing a story in
line with the oral tradition, i.e., telling all events as they occurred, enriched
with depictions of characters and situations, and with little or no digression
into commentary, explanation, or interpretation. Conversely, in the French
language, the narrator relies on the notion that oral story-telling does not
necessarily require a blow-by-blow account. The French speaker navigates
through the diﬀerent narrative levels by including a considerable number
of comments and additional explanations.

representative of the objects and events in the story), whereas the French
participants produced comparatively fewer representational gestures.

This result is consistent with the ﬁnding that Zulu subjects, especially
adults, favour a detailed and exhaustive account of the story in line with
the oral tradition. The more the speakers remained on the narrative level,
the more representational gestures appeared. For the French speakers, who
had more non-narrative clauses,
their gestures were more pragmatic
(discursive gestures that mark structure and cohesion within the narrative,
framing gestures that help reinforce, connote, or supplement a verbal
utterance), and tended to alleviate the load of expressive, connotative, and
cohesive properties from the verbal
level. This result clearly adds to
McNeill’s postulate that gesture and speech are one system (for new and
provocative arguments, see McNeill, ). Furthermore, this suggests an
extension of this postulate to non-representational aspects of language and
gesture: the type of co-speech gesture one produces while speaking not
only depends on representational properties of hand and head gestures, it
also depends on the type of speech act one is actually verbalizing, as
preliminary observations of French children’s narratives (Colletta, ;
Colletta, Kunene, Venouil, Kaufmann, & Simon, ) have tended to
show.

To conclude the language comparison, French and Zulu narratives showed
diﬀerences in speech as well as in gesture, as the Zulu ten-year old children
and adults produced more detailed narratives, used a
lot more
representational gestures, and rarely interrupted the telling of the events to
insert a personal comment. We think cultural speciﬁcities in conceptions
of literacy can help to explain these diﬀerences.

Limitations
The limitations of this study should be acknowledged. An older cohort of
child data from pre-adolescents throughout the adolescent stage would
help us to reﬁne the developmental model. An in-depth analysis of the
frequently produced type of gesture – representational gesture in this
case – would show us the cultural,
linguistic, and age diﬀerences by
examining the shape and the meaning (as seen in Graziano, ), as this
will help track the cognitive changes in how children represent events,
characters, and actions in a narrative. Other types of gestures that have a
pragmatic or expressive framing function, or a discursive or cohesive
function, also need to be investigated to help understand when and how
pragmatic and discourse constraints evolve during childhood. As for
methods, the way people respond to data-collection methods also has an
eﬀect on narrative and gesture production. A previous study on French
spontaneous narratives produced by children aged six to eleven years

(Colletta et al., ) showed advanced social abilities in the ten- and
eleven-year-olds that were not found in the children’s narratives collected
for these studies. Data-collection methods may have eﬀects on results in
cross-linguistic and cross-cultural investigations and should be given more
consideration.

Future directions
This study sheds new light on some previously unstudied aspects of oral
narrative development
in two cultural and linguistic groups never
compared before. First, a developmental shift towards complex narrative
production was noted. It appears that the age-related tendency to enrich
oral narratives with various types of comments may be analyzed both from
the perspective of cognitive development, insofar as it reveals cognitive
decentring, and from the perspective of social development, insofar as it
reveals new social conversational abilities. Second, this development can
be inﬂuenced by language or cultural belonging, in which each cultural
group has a diﬀerent distribution of salient features that mark the target
discourse competency level.

The results of this study suggest an exciting future direction to expand the
research into the multimodality of discourse, in particular as it sheds new
light on a less studied language with an oral tradition. To ignore the study
of gesture in language use and development is a loss to understanding the
human mind.
