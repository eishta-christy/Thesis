ABSTRACT
This study investigates whether second language learners’ processing of stress can be explained by
the degree to which suprasegmental cues contribute to lexical identity in the native language. It
focuses on Standard Mandarin, Taiwan Mandarin, and American English listeners’ processing of
stress in English nonwords. In Mandarin, fundamental frequency contributes to lexical identity by
signaling lexical tones, but only in Standard Mandarin does duration distinguish stressed–unstressed
and stressed–stressed words. Participants completed sequence-recall tasks containing English disyl-
labic nonwords contrasting in stress. Experiment 1 used natural stimuli; Experiment 2 used resyn-
thesized stimuli that isolated fundamental frequency and duration cues. Experiment 1 revealed no
difference among the groups; in Experiment 2, Standard Mandarin listeners used duration more than
Taiwan Mandarin listeners did. These results are interpreted within a cue-weighting theory of speech
perception.

The ﬁrst language (L1) is often claimed to be responsible for second language (L2)
learners’ (in)ability to process particular sounds in the target language. However,
the conditions under which the L1 facilitates or inhibits the learning of new sounds
are unclear, especially in the suprasegmental domain. Theoretical models such as
Flege’s (1995) speech learning model and Best’s (1995) perceptual assimilation
model predict L2 learners’ performance based on the phonetic similarity between
L1 and L2 sounds. However, most of the evidence in support of these (and other)
L2 speech perception models comes from studies that focus on consonants (e.g.,
Best, McRoberts, & Goodell, 2001; Best, McRoberts, & Sithole, 1988; Flege &
Hillenbrand, 1986; Flege, Munro, & Mackay, 1995; Flege, Takagi, & Mann, 1996)
and vowels (e.g., Flege, 1987; Flege, Bohn, & Jang, 1997; Flege, Munro, & Fox,
1994; Fox, Flege, & Munro, 1995). L2 learners’ processing of suprasegmental
information has been the focus of less research, and it is therefore less well
understood.

Studies have shown that whether suprasegmental cues contribute to distinguish-
ing among words in the L1, and how they do so, inﬂuences L2 learners’ use of
these cues in the L2 (for discussion, see Cutler, 2012). Existing L2 studies on
lexical tones have shown that how different aspects of fundamental frequency (F0;
e.g., pitch direction and pitch height) signal lexical identity in the L1 largely de-
termines how L2 learners perceive and process tones in the target language (e.g.,
Francis, Ciocca, Ma, & Fenn, 2008; Hall´e, Chang, & Best, 2004; Leather, 1987;
Lee, Vakock, & Wurm; 1996; Stagray & Downs, 1993; Wang, Spence, Jongman,
& Sereno, 1999; Wayland & Guion, 2004). By contrast, previous research on
the perception and processing of stress has focused on the degree of similarity
or difference between the L1 and L2 stress systems (i.e., whether or not stress
falls on the same syllable vs. on different syllables across words; Dupoux, Pal-
lier, Sebasti´an, & Mehler, 1997; Dupoux, Peperkamp, & Sebasti´an-Gall´es, 2001;
Dupoux, Sebasti´an-Gall´es, Navarrete, & Peperkamp, 2008; Peperkamp & Dupoux,
2002; Peperkamp, Vendelin, & Dupoux, 2010; Tremblay, 2008, 2009), and not so
much on the speciﬁc suprasegmental cues (e.g., F0, duration, and intensity) that
instantiate stress in the L1 versus the L2 (but see Cooper, Cutler, & Wales, 2002;
Lin, Wang, Idsardi, & Xu, 2014; Ortega-Llebaria, Hong, & Fan, 2013; Zhang &
Francis, 2010). Hence, it is unclear whether the L2 processing of word-level stress
is determined by how suprasegmental cues contribute to lexical identity in the L1.
The present study sheds further light on this question by investigating L2 learn-
ers’ use of F0 and duration cues in the processing of word-level stress. More
speciﬁcally, this study examines whether a cue-weighting theory of speech per-
ception (e.g., Francis & Nusbaum, 2002; Holt & Lotto, 2006; Ingvalson, Holt,
& McClelland, 2011; Zhang & Francis, 2010) can explain L2 learners’ ability
to process word-level stress. It does so by comparing the processing of stress in
L2 learners of English who speak Standard Mandarin (SM) or Taiwan Mandarin
(TM) as L1 dialects and who are at a similar proﬁciency in English. As will be
shown below, SM, but not TM, instantiates word-level stress with the use of du-
ration. This study investigates whether native SM and native TM listeners who
have learned English as L2 differ in their ability to use duration as a cue to stress.
An additional contribution of this study is that it investigates the effect of the L1
dialect on L2 learners’ use of suprasegmental cues to stress.

L2 PERCEPTION AND PROCESSING OF WORD-LEVEL STRESS

Stress is lexically contrastive in languages such as English, Dutch, and Spanish.
For instance, in English, record (noun) and record (verb) form a minimal pair with
respect to stress placement. By contrast, languages such as French or Finnish do
not have word-level stress. To illustrate, in French, the ﬁnal syllable of the last
word in a phrase is accented, with this accent functioning as a boundary marker
for words or phrases (e.g., Jun & Fougeron, 2000, 2002; Vaissi`ere, 1991; Welby,
2006) but not distinguishing among segmentally identical words. Languages thus
differ in whether or not stress contributes to lexical identity.

Native speakers of languages that have contrastive stress have little difﬁculty
encoding stress in L2 words or in nonwords. Using four cross-modal priming ex-
periments and two forced-choice identiﬁcation experiments, Cooper et al. (2002)

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:3

543

showed that Dutch-speaking L2 learners of English, who use stress to recognize
Dutch words, were quite successful at using the suprasegmental cues of English
stress to recognize English words. Similarly, Dupoux and colleagues have shown
that native Spanish listeners are successful in distinguishing and recalling non-
words that differ in stress (Dupoux et al., 2001, 2008; Peperkamp et al., 2010).

In contrast, native speakers of languages that do not have contrastive stress have
difﬁculty processing word-level stress. Using a sequence-recall task, Dupoux and
colleagues showed that native French-speaking listeners, but not native Spanish-
speaking listeners, had difﬁculty encoding stress when listening to nonwords
(Dupoux et al., 2001; Peperkamp & Dupoux, 2002). To explain these ﬁndings,
they proposed that listeners’ (in)ability to distinguish stress contrast is determined
by whether, within the ﬁrst 2 years of life, they set the stress parameter to encode
stress in their phonological representation of lexical words (Peperkamp, 2004;
Peperkamp & Dupoux, 2002). For languages without contrastive stress (e.g.,
French), infants are predicted to observe stress regularity across words and thus
not encode stress in their mental lexicon, which was considered the cause of their
so-called stress deafness. This stress deafness was observed not only in native
French-speaking listeners but also in proﬁcient French-speaking L2 learners of
Spanish (Dupoux et al., 2008) and in simultaneous French–Spanish bilinguals
who were French dominant (Dupoux, Peperkamp, & Sebasti´an-Gall´es, 2010).
This suggests that for L2 learners who do not have contrastive stress in their
dominant language, the difﬁculty in processing word-level stress is very robust.

Recent studies indicate that the mechanism underlying stress processing may not
operate in an all or none fashion. Subtle differences between L1 and L2 prosodic
systems can also inﬂuence L2 learners’ processing of stress (e.g., Tremblay, 2008,
2009). For instance, Tremblay (2008) found that not all French-speaking L2 learn-
ers were “stress-deaf”; in her study, several French Canadian L2 learners of English
were able to use the stress contrast to distinguish between competing L2 word
candidates. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the ﬁndings
of Tremblay and those of Dupoux and colleagues, in addition to methodological
differences between the two sets of studies, is that speakers of Canadian French
may have less difﬁculty than speakers of European French in using stress contrast
for L2 lexical access because of the greater contrast between strong and weak syl-
lables in Canadian French as compared to European French (for a discussion, see
Tremblay, 2008, 2009). Another possible explanation is that speakers of Canadian
French may have less difﬁculty using stress contrast for L2 lexical access because
the speciﬁc suprasegmental cues that signal English stress (e.g., F0, duration, and
intensity) may be used more in Canadian French than in European French.

In the realm of L2 speech perception, empirical research has demonstrated that
surface phonetic details can play an important role in determining the difﬁculties
that L2 learners may experience in L2 speech perception. The cue-weighting
theory of speech perception (e.g., Francis et al., 2008; Francis & Nusbaum, 2002;
Gandour, 1983; Holt & Lotto, 2006; Ingvalson et al., 2011; Zhang & Francis,
2010) highlights the importance of these phonetic details, as it is concerned with
how acoustic cues that signal a speciﬁc contrast are weighed in different languages
and how differences in this weighting affect L2 speech perception and processing.
According to this theory, speech perception is multidimensional, and acoustic

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:3

544

cues are weighed differently across categories and across languages. Although
multiple cues are simultaneously available to listeners, these cues are not weighed
equally, and they often have “trading relations” (e.g., Repp, 1982), with increased
sensitivity to one cue being accompanied by decreased sensitivity to another cue.
Listeners from different language backgrounds tune in to different acoustic cues
in the same stimuli depending on how these cues are used to signal a contrast in
the L1.

A clear example of the relevance of cue weighting exists for the perception of /l/
and /ɹ/ by Japanese L2 learners of English, as illustrated in Iverson, Kuhl, Akahane-
Yamada, Diesch, Tohkura, Kettermann, and Siebert (2003). Prior studies had found
that Japanese listeners had great difﬁculty distinguishing between English /l/ and
/ɹ/ (Bradlow, Pisoni, Yamada, & Tohkura, 1997; Lively, Logan, & Pisoni, 1993;
Logan, Lively, & Pisoni, 1991; Yamada, 1995). In their comparison of native
English listeners and Japanese- and German-speaking L2 learners of English,
Iverson et al. (2003) showed that English listeners discriminated the native /l/–/ɹ/
contrast using the third formant (F3). In contrast, Japanese listeners were more
sensitive to the second formant (F2) than to F3, probably because the Japanese
liquid is perceptually more similar to English /l/, which is often cued by a low
F2, than to English /ɹ/, which is often cued by a low F3 (e.g., Aoyama, Flege,
Guion, Yamada, & Akahane-Yamada, 2004). Because Japanese listeners did not
pay sufﬁcient attention to F3, they found it difﬁcult to perceive the English contrast.
Although German /ʁ/ differs from English /ɹ/, German listeners, unlike Japanese
listeners, were able to distinguish English /l/ and /ɹ/ because of their sensitivity
to F3. Japanese listeners’ perceptual difﬁculty was attributed to their sensitivity
to unhelpful F2 information, whereas German listeners’ perceptual sensitivity
was attributed to their sufﬁcient attention to F3, a critical cue for distinguishing
English /l/ and /ɹ/ (for a model that similarly predicts L2 learners’ perception
of L2 categories on the basis of the mapping between L1 phonetic cues and the
corresponding L1 categories, see Escudero, 2005, 2009; Escudero & Boersma,
2004).

Like segments, multiple suprasegmental cues (i.e., F0, duration, and intensity)
contribute to the realization of word-level stress (e.g., Beckman, 1986; Fry, 1955;
Lieberman, 1961) and more generally to lexical identity (e.g., in lexical tones;
Chao, 1968; Duanmu, 2007). Moreover, languages with word-level stress differ
in the extent to which suprasegmental cues contribute relevant information for
lexical access. For instance, native English listeners have been shown to make
limited use of suprasegmental cues to stress, as English stress is also signaled
by segmental information (full vs. reduced vowels); as a result, English listeners’
word recognition is not inhibited by errors in stress placement unless these errors
result in segmental (i.e., vowel quality) changes in the word (Braun, Lemh¨ofer,
& Mani, 2011; Cutler, 1986; Cutler & Clifton, 1984; Cutler, Wales, Cooper, &
Janssen, 2007; Fear, Cutler, & Butterﬁeld, 1995; Small, Simon, & Goldberg,
1988). Likewise, native English listeners rely less on suprasegmental cues to
English stress than do Dutch-speaking L2 learners of English, because vowel
reduction is more frequent in English than in Dutch (Cooper et al., 2002; Cutler
et al., 2007). This suggests that the language-speciﬁc weighting of cues to English
stress affects how listeners from different language backgrounds process it.

THE PRESENT STUDY

545

The present study further investigates whether the L2 learners’ processing of stress
is determined by the degree to which individual suprasegmental cues contribute to
lexical identity in the L1. It does so by focusing on an L1-L2 pairing that has been
the object of relatively little research: Mandarin-speaking L2 learners of English
(but see Chrabaszcz, Win, Lin, & Idsardi, 2014; Lin et al., 2014; Wang, 2008;
Zhang & Francis, 2010). Suprasegmental cues have a greater functional load in
Mandarin than in English, because Mandarin words with different lexical tones
(signaled primarily by F0 cues) have different meanings (e.g., [m¯a] “mother,” [m´a]
“hemp,” [mˇa] “horse,” and [m`a] “scold”; Chao, 1968; Duanmu, 2007)1 ; although
English has word-level stress, it has few words that can be distinguished only in
the suprasegmental cues to stress (e.g., trusty vs. trustee; Cutler, 1986; Cutler &
Clifton, 1984).

Two target Mandarin varieties, SM and TM, are the focus of the present study.
SM is based on the Beijing dialect (i.e., Putonghua) and spoken by the people
of Mainland China, whereas TM is spoken by the people of Taiwan and, thus,
inﬂuenced by Taiwanese (i.e., Southern Min). Because SM and TM share the
above tonal system, they both use F0 as the primary suprasegmental cue to lexical
identity (e.g., Howie, 1976; Liu & Samuel, 2004). Although duration is a secondary
cue to lexical tones in Mandarin, it is much less reliable than F0 to signal word
identity, because the duration of the tone is affected by its position in the word
and in the sentence (e.g., Howie, 1976; Lai, Sui, & Yuan, 2010; Liu & Samuel,
2004; Nordenhake & Svantesson, 1983; Shen, 1993). For instance, tones have
shorter durations in non–word-ﬁnal than in word-ﬁnal positions, and they have
shorter durations in non–phrase-ﬁnal than in phrase-ﬁnal positions (Nordenhake
& Svantesson, 1983; Shen, 1993); yet Chinese listeners recognize them despite
this variability in duration.

It is important to note that SM and TM differ in the extent to which duration
signals lexical identity, because only SM has word-level stress, and the primary
suprasegmental cue to stress contrasts is precisely duration. SM has a stress
pattern that contrasts stressed–stressed and stressed–unstressed disyllabic words
(e.g., respectively, ['tʊ̄ ŋ'ɕī] “west and east” vs. ['tʊ̄ ŋɕi] “stuff,” both written as
͈㺫; Chao, 1968; Duanmu, 2007). The second syllable of stressed–unstressed
words (e.g., ['tʊ̄ ŋɕi]) is consistently shorter than the second syllable of stressed–
stressed words (e.g., ['tʊ̄ ŋ'ɕī]; Chen & Xu, 2006; Lee & Zee, 2010; Lin, 1985;
Lin & Yan, 1980). Duration is thus a robust cue, hence the primary perceptual
cue, to this stress contrast (e.g., Lin, 1985). The second syllable of stressed–
unstressed words also carries a neutral tone that can vary in F0 depending on
the lexical tone carried by the preceding syllable: the F0 contour of the neu-
tral tone can be characterized as midfalling after a high-level tone, high falling
after a rising tone, midlevel after a dipping tone, and low falling after a high
falling tone (Lee & Zee, 2010). F0 is thus a secondary cue to this stress con-
trast (Lin, 1985). Although unstressed syllables in Standard Mandarin are also
reduced, vowel reduction has not been deemed important as a cue to Mandarin
stress, at least as compared to English stress (e.g., Lin, 1985; Zhang & Francis,
2010).

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:3

546

By contrast, TM does not have this stress distinction: disyllabic words have
the stressed–stressed pattern, and the second syllable of disyllabic words is not
reduced (e.g., ['tʊ̄ ŋ'ɕī] “west and east” vs. ['tʊ̄ ŋ'ɕī] “stuff,” both written as Ო
㺫; Kubler, 1985; Swihart, 2003). Unlike in SM, the second syllable of ['tʊ̄ ŋ'ɕī]
“stuff” is not shorter than the second syllable of ['tʊ̄ ŋ'ɕī] “west and east” in TM,
and the second syllable of the two words do not differ in intensity either (Huang,
2011, 2012). As the second syllable of disyllabic words in TM is not reduced,
the neutral tone carried by this second syllable does not vary in F0 depending
on the lexical tone carried by the preceding syllable; this neutral tone often has a
low F0 regardless of the preceding tone (Huang, 2011, 2012). Hence, given the
absence of stressed–unstressed words in TM, duration appears to be a relatively
less important cue to lexical identity in TM than it is in SM.

Existing L2 studies on Mandarin listeners’ processing of English stress have
yielded mixed ﬁndings. Using a forced-choice word class identiﬁcation task (e.g.,
DEsert as noun vs. deSERT as verb), Zhang and Francis (2010) found that
Mandarin-speaking L2 learners of English from Mainland China but tested in
the United States, who were a middle to high proﬁciency level (i.e., 7 as an aver-
age self-evaluation score in a 10-point scale), relied more on vowel quality (i.e.,
F1–F3) than on suprasegmental cues to English stress and did not differ from
native English listeners in their use of F0 and duration cues. However, using a
forced-choice English stress identiﬁcation task (i.e., stress on ﬁrst syllable vs. sec-
ond syllable), Wang (2008) found that Mandarin-speaking L2 learners of English
from Mainland China and tested in China (whose English proﬁciency was not
reported) did not rely on segmental cues and used only F0 as a cue to English
stress. These inconsistent ﬁndings may stem in part from the potentially different
proﬁciencies of the L2 learners that were tested. Speciﬁcally, the L2 learners who
lived in the United States (Zhang & Francis, 2010) may have been more proﬁcient
than those who lived in China (Wang, 2008).

Lin et al. (2014) remedied this problem by examining the processing of English
stress in proﬁciency-matched SM- and Korean-speaking L2 learners of English.
Unlike English and SM, Korean does not have word-level stress (Jun, 2005; Sohn,
1999). Participants completed a sequence-recall task (Experiment 1) and a lexical
decision task (Experiment 2); in the latter, words were selected such that their
incorrect stress placement affected (humane as /'hjumən/ vs. /hjə'mejn/) or did not
affect (e.g., enough as /'ɪnʌf/ vs. /ɪ'nʌf/) vowel quality. The results of Experiment
1 revealed that the Mandarin group had an advantage over the Korean group in
encoding stress in English nonwords. The results of Experiment 2 showed that
vowel quality did not affect stress processing in either L2 group. These results
suggest that suprasegmental cues to stress (including F0 and duration, which were
not isolated in this study) enhanced stress processing only in the group for which
these cues signaled lexical identity in the L1 (e.g., the SM group).

However, no research (to our knowledge) to date has investigated whether L2
learners whose L1 does not have word-level stress (e.g., TM) can transfer the use
of a suprasegmental cue (here, F0) from a different phonological category (i.e.,
lexical tones) to word-level stress in the L2. Furthermore, it is unclear whether
L2 learners differ in their ability to use a particular suprasegmental cue to stress
(here, duration) as a function of the relative weight of that cue in the L1 (e.g.,

SM vs. TM). The present study examines these issues by investigating SM and
TM listeners’ use of F0 and duration to encode English stress. In doing so, and
following recent studies investigating how L1 dialect affects the L2 perception
of segments (e.g., Chl´adkov´a & Podlipsk´y, 2011; Colantoni, Steele, & Escudero,
2015; Escudero, Simon, & Mitterer, 2012; Escudero & Williams, 2012; Mayr &
Escudero, 2010), this study also sheds light on whether the L1 dialect can modulate
L2 learners’ encoding of English stress.

Following previous research on the processing of stress (Dupoux et al., 2001,
2008), this study uses sequence-recall experiments in which listeners listen to
and encode sequences of words that differed in stress pattern. Dupoux et al.
(2001) have proposed that the sequence-recall task provides a more robust method
to study the processing of stress, because it requires listeners to encode stress in
acoustically variable stimuli and discourages response strategies given the memory
load it imposes on listeners. In the task, participants ﬁrst learn to encode a stress
distinction (e.g., 'numi = 1; nu'mi = 2); then they hear sequences of nonwords that
vary in stress pattern and must accurately encode the stress pattern of each nonsense
word in the sequence (e.g., 'numi, nu'mi, 'numi, nu'mi = 1212). Sequence-recall
tasks can thus assess whether nonnative listeners can encode acoustically variable
word-level stress together with the segmental content of the words.

Our participants completed two such tasks. The ﬁrst sequence-recall task con-
tained naturally recorded English nonwords (Experiment 1), and the second se-
quence recall task contained resynthesized English nonwords (Experiment 2).
Experiment 1 served to establish a baseline in listeners’ processing of word-level
stress when F0 and duration cues naturally co-occurred.2 Experiment 2 examined
how listeners use F0 and duration cues when these cues are isolated or pitted
against each other.

METHOD

The two experiments took place consecutively, with a short break (approximately
5 min) in between. Experiment 1 was conducted before Experiment 2 in order to
establish baseline results with natural stimuli and because the former was easier
(F0 and duration cues converged) than the latter (F0 and duration converged in
only one of four conditions). The same participants completed both Experiments
1 and 2.

Participants
Thirty L2 learners of English who spoke either SM (n = 15) or TM (n = 15) as
their L1 and 15 native English listeners participated in this study. The English- and
SM-speaking participants were undergraduate and graduate students who studied
at a Midwestern American university. Because it was difﬁcult to ﬁnd enough TM-
speaking participants at the institution where the present research took place, 9 of
the 15 TM-speaking learners were recruited and tested in Taiwan.

A questionnaire was used to collect biographical and language experience infor-
mation about the participants. This questionnaire revealed that the great majority
of our SM-speaking and TM-speaking participants did not know other Chinese

languages.3 All of the SM-speaking participants and 8 of the 15 TM-speaking par-
ticipants had spent at least 1 month in an English-speaking country. No participant
reported having any speech or hearing impairment.

A cloze (i.e., ﬁll in the blank) test (Brown, 1980) was used to assess the L2 learn-
ers’ proﬁciency in English. One advantage of using a written cloze test rather than
an aural/oral proﬁciency test is that it avoids potentially circular argumentation
by tapping into a set of language skills that are known to be highly predictive of
general proﬁciency but that differ from the skills used in the present phonological
processing experiment (e.g., performance on an aural/oral comprehension experi-
ment is likely to be inﬂuenced by listeners’ ability to perceive and produce English
stress). The particular cloze test that the L2 learners completed (Brown, 1980) was
administered for a few years as part of the Guangzhou English Language Test at
the Guangzhou English Language Center (Guangdong, China), and later as part
of the English Language Institute Placement Test at the University of Hawai‘i
(J. D. Brown, personal communication, April 28, 2007). Because it has been the
object of much research (for details, see Brown, 1980), the test is regarded as a
valid and reliable measure of global English proﬁciency. The maximum number
of correct responses on the test was 50. The L2 learners’ responses on the test
were considered accurate so long as they were acceptable, as determined by a
list of answers that were considered acceptable when the test was administered
as part of the English Language Institute Placement Test at the University of
Hawai‘i.

The participants’ biographical, language background, and proﬁciency informa-
tion is provided in Table 1. Analyses of the L2 learners’ cloze test scores and
length of residence in English-speaking countries revealed a signiﬁcant positive
correlation (r = .472, n = 30, p < .008), indicating that the L2 learners were more
proﬁcient in English if they spent a longer amount of time in English-speaking
countries. Comparisons of the two groups of L2 learners revealed no signiﬁcant
difference between them in their age of acquisition of English, t (28) = 1.362, p >
.1, length of residence in English-speaking countries, t (19.3) = –0.255, p > .1, or
proﬁciency in English, t (21.5) = 1.464, p > .1.4 Despite this lack of difference,
the fact that some of the TM listeners lived in Taiwan at the time of testing may
raise concerns as to whether the TM listeners were as proﬁcient in English as the
SM listeners. To factor out possible proﬁciency effects in our results, we included
L2 learners’ proﬁciency as a continuous variable in the statistical analyses.5

Experiment 1

Materials. The stimuli were minimal pairs of English nonwords that differed
in stress pattern (e.g., ['fʌði] vs. [fʌ'ði]). The nonwords were created such that
they would have a consonant–vowel (CV) C1V1C2V2 structure. To ensure that the
stress stimuli would not have vowel reduction cues to stress and still sound like
English words, /ɪ/, /ʊ/, and /ʌ/ were used in V1 position and [i] was used in V2
position, because these sounds would not be reduced to schwas as a function of
stress placement in English words. To ensure that the consonants would similarly
not provide segmental cues to stress, only fricatives and voiced stops were used
in positions of C1 and C2 (e.g., Cho & Keating, 2001; Tremblay, 2009). Twelve
experimental nonwords were used (for a complete list, see Table A.1 in Appendix
A).

The experiment also included ﬁller stimuli that differed in their word-initial
consonant (e.g., [tɪvi] vs. [kɪvi]) to prevent participants from developing stress-
speciﬁc processing strategies. The ﬁller stimuli always contrasted in the sounds
/t/ and /k/, and they matched the stress contrast stimuli in their phonological
structure, with /ɪ/, /ʊ/, and /ʌ/ being used in V1 position and [i] in V2 position.
To increase the phonetic variability in the stimuli, fricatives (/f/, /v/, /θ/, and /ð/),
voiced stops (/b/, /d/, and /g/), or sonorants (/m/, /n/, and /l/) were used for the
sound in C2 position. A total of 12 nonwords were used for the ﬁllers (for a
complete list, see Table A.2 in Appendix A).6 The inclusion of these ﬁller items
in the experiment encouraged participants to attend to both suprasegmental and
segmental information, and allowed us to rule out any effect of L1 dialect on their
encoding of segmental words.

The nonwords were produced by a female native speaker of American English
with a Midwestern accent. She read each nonword four times in the carrier sentence
“Say ___ again.” Two tokens were selected from the four repetitions of each stress
pattern. The stimuli included a total of 96 tokens: 48 experimental tokens (12
nonwords × 2 stress patterns × 2 tokens) and 48 ﬁller tokens (12 nonwords ×
2 segmental contrasts × 2 tokens). Any given sequence (described in the next
section) never contained the same token twice.

Acoustic measurements of the stress stimuli, provided in Table 2, revealed that
the nonwords with initial and ﬁnal stress differed signiﬁcantly in the F0 and
duration ratios of the ﬁrst syllable to the second syllable, F0: t (23) = 17.1,

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:3

550
p < .01; duration: t (23) = 5.58, p < .01. It can be noted that both nonwords
with initial stress and nonwords with ﬁnal stress have a shorter initial syllable than
ﬁnal syllable due to word-ﬁnal lengthening. The intensity of all the stimuli was
normalized at 70 dB.

Procedures. The task was conducted using Paradigm software (Perception Re-
search Systems, 2007). The experimental stimuli were heard together in the same
block, and the ﬁller stimuli were heard together in a separate block. The sequence-
recall task had two main phases: a familiarization (or association) phase and a
testing phase. In the familiarization phase, participants were trained to associate
1 and 2 (on a keyboard) with word-initial and word-ﬁnal stress (experimental
stimuli) or with “t” and “k” (ﬁller stimuli). This was done using real words (trusty
vs. trustee, table vs. cable). Participants received feedback on whether or not
their responses were correct. After 18 trials, an association test was conducted in
which participants were required to correctly identify the stress pattern or initial
consonant they heard (as 1 or 2). The participants were invited to complete the
testing phase only after receiving an accuracy score equal to or higher than 95%
on the association test. If the participants did not achieve 95% accuracy, they were
required to take the familiarization task again, up to two more times. Given the
transparency of the familiarization phase, 40 of the 45 participants reached the
accuracy criterion in their ﬁrst attempt, and the 5 participants who were required to
take the task again reached the accuracy criterion within three attempts. The train-
ing took 10–20 min depending on whether the participants reached the accuracy
criterion on their ﬁrst attempt.

In the testing phase, participants were asked to recall sequences of four tokens by
pressing 1 and 2 in the correct order. For the experimental stimuli, each sequence
included two tokens with word-initial stress and two tokens with word-ﬁnal stress
(e.g., [fʌ'ði] ['fʌði] ['fʌði] [fʌ'ði]). For the ﬁller stimuli, each sequence included
two tokens with word-initial /t/ and two tokens with word-initial /k/ (e.g., [tɪvi]
[kɪvi] [kɪvi] [tɪvi]). Six different token orders (i.e., [1122], [2211], [1212], [1221],
[2121], [2112]) were used for the sequences of nonwords. The six orders were
used to counterbalance the number of nonwords with initial and ﬁnal stress or with
initial /t/ and /k/ within a sequence. Sequences with identical stress patterns or
initial consonants (i.e., [1111], [2222]) were not used because there was no change
in the sequences; thus, such trials might be much easier than other trials (Dupoux
et al., 2001). Sequences with three identical stress patterns or initial consonants
(i.e., [1112], [1121], [1211], [2111], [1222], [2122], [2212], [2221]) were also not
used to keep the task relatively short. As will be shown in the Results section,
despite the limited number of patterns to be recalled, listeners did not perform well
on the task, indicating that the task was difﬁcult. The order of sequences and of
tokens within each sequence was randomized across participants. The experiment
included a total of 72 experimental trials (12 nonwords × 6 orders) and 72 ﬁller
trials (12 nonwords × 6 orders). The experimental and ﬁller trials were heard in
different blocks.

At the beginning of each trial, participants saw the visual prompt “next trial.”
Then they heard the four nonwords, each separated by an interstimulus interval
of 50 ms, as in previous research (e.g., Dupoux et al., 2001, 2008). The last

interstimulus interval in the sequence was followed by the auditory prompt “OK”
in another female voice to prevent participants from using echoic memory to
recall the sequences. The intertrial interval was 1500 ms. Participants completed
a practice session of 12 sequences to ensure that they understood how to carry out
the task before the actual experiment. The experiment took 20–30 min to complete.

Data analysis and predictions. Logit mixed-effects models were conducted on
the participants’ sequence-encoding accuracy. The models were ﬁtted in R using
the lmer function from the lme4 package for mixed-effects models (for discussion,
see Baayen, 2008).

The ﬁrst two analyses focused on participants’ accuracy with stimuli that dif-
fered in stress. A ﬁrst model analyzed the sequence-encoding accuracy of the three
groups, with L1 (English, SM, and TM; baseline = English) as ﬁxed effect and
with participant, test item, trial order, and sequence order (e.g., [1122], [2211])
as crossed random effects. A second model analyzed the sequence-encoding ac-
curacy of only the L2 groups, with L1 dialect (SM and TM; baseline = SM), L2
proﬁciency (centered cloze test scores, obtained by subtracting the cloze test mean
[across participants] from the raw cloze test score, to reduce multicollinearity in the
model), and their interaction as ﬁxed effects, and with participant, test item, trial or-
der, and sequence order as crossed random effects. The last two analyses were iden-
tical to the ﬁrst two, but they were instead performed on participants’ sequence-
encoding accuracy on test items that differed in their initial consonant (i.e., the
ﬁller items). For each analysis, ﬁxed effects were removed from the initial (i.e.,
most complex) model one at a time, and model comparisons were run in pairwise
fashion to determine if the more complex model accounted for signiﬁcantly more
of the variance, as determined by log-likelihood ratio tests. We report the simplest
model that accounted for signiﬁcantly more of the variance than simpler models.
Whether TM listeners differ from SM listeners in their ability to process English
stress in Experiment 1, where the F0 and duration cues coincide, depends on
whether or not these cues are additive in the processing of English stress. If
they are, TM-speaking L2 learners of English should be less accurate than SM-
speaking L2 learners of English at encoding English stress, because TM listeners
are expected to be less reliant on duration as a cue to lexical identity as compared
to SM listeners. If, in contrast, cues to stress are not additive, and if TM listeners
can transfer the use of F0 cues to word identity from the lexical tones in TM to
word-level stress in English, then TM and SM listeners should perform similarly
on the task, because F0 is the primary cue to lexical tones and thus signals lexical
identity in both languages.

Results. The accuracy of the participants’ sequence encoding for stimuli that
differed in stress pattern is shown in Figure 1.

The best logit mixed-effects model on all the participants’ accuracy was a model
that did not include any ﬁxed effect (i.e., adding L1 to the model did not improve
it). This indicates that neither the SM group nor the TM group differed from the
English group in their encoding of stress in English nonwords.

Similarly, the best logit mixed-effect models on the L2 learners’ accuracy did
not include any ﬁxed effect (i.e., adding L1 dialect and/or L2 proﬁciency to the

model did not improve it). This indicates that SM and TM listeners did not differ
from each other in their processing of stress, and L2 proﬁciency (as measured by
the cloze test) did not inﬂuence their performance on the task. Hence, all three
groups patterned similarly in the processing stress in English nonwords.7

The accuracy of the participants’ sequence encoding for stimuli that differed in
their initial consonant is shown in Figure 2. The best logit mixed-effects model on
all the participants’ accuracy included L1 as ﬁxed effect. This model is summarized
in Table 3. The results of this analysis suggests that the English group outperformed
the SM and TM groups in their encoding of /t/ and /k/ in English nonwords.
However, the best logit mixed-effect model on the L2 learners’ accuracy did not
include any effect, indicating that SM and TM listeners did not differ from each
other in their processing of /t/ and /k/ in English nonwords.

Discussion. The results revealed no signiﬁcant difference in performance be-
tween any of the groups in their encoding of stress in English nonwords. This
indicates that the TM-speaking L2 learners of English encoded English stress as
well as did native English listeners and SM-speaking L2 learners of English, both
of whom have word-level stress in their L1. The results also showed that the SM
and TM listeners did not differ from each other but performed less accurately
than English listeners when encoding word-initial /t/ and /k/. The lower segmental
accuracy of the L2 groups as compared to native English listeners may be due
to differences between English and Mandarin in their phonetic realizations of the
target segments (e.g., English /t/ is alveolar whereas Mandarin /t/ is dental) and
possibly in their phonotactics (e.g., the lax vowels following /t/ and /k/ in the
stimuli are not permitted in Mandarin).

The lack of signiﬁcant difference between TM listeners and SM (and English)
listeners in the experimental condition indicates that TM listeners were not at a
disadvantage as compared to SM listeners when processing English stress. If TM
listeners are less reliant on duration cues to lexical identity than SM listeners, as
we predicted from the weighting of suprasegmental cues in their L1, then these
results might suggest that the F0 cues were sufﬁcient for TM listeners to be able
to process English stress. Listeners’ independent use of F0 and duration cannot,
however, be assessed without isolating these cues in experimental stimuli.

Experiment 2 used resynthesized stimuli in which F0 and duration were manip-
ulated in order to determine whether TM and SM listeners differ from each other
in their use of F0 and duration cues to English stress.

Experiment 2

Materials. As in Experiment 1, the experimental stimuli were minimal pairs of
English nonwords that differed only in suprasegmental cues to stress (e.g., ['fʌði]
vs. [fʌ'ði]). Because voiced stops and fricatives might behave differently in cueing
stress, only nonwords containing fricative consonants were used in Experiment 2
to control for the cues provided by the initial consonant. Four nonwords (/sɪvi/,
/zʊθi/, /fʌði/, and /hʌﬁ/) were selected for resynthesis from the nonwords used in
Experiment 1. The experimental stimuli included a total of 16 tokens (4 segmental
nonwords× 2 stress patterns× 2 repetitions). As in Experiment 1, four nonwords
differing in their word-initial consonant (e.g., [tɪvi] vs. [kɪvi]) were also selected

from Experiment 1 as ﬁllers to prevent participants from developing stress-speciﬁc
processing strategies. The ﬁller stimuli included a total of 16 tokens (4 segmen-
tal nonword pairs × 2 initial consonants × 2 repetitions). Any given sequence
(described in the next section) never contained the same token twice.

As shown in Table 4, the experimental nonwords with initial and ﬁnal stress
differed signiﬁcantly in the F0 and duration ratios of the ﬁrst syllable to the second
syllable, F0: t (7) = 24.6, p < .01; duration: t (7) = 7.01, p < .01. The values
in Table 4 are similar to those presented in Table 2, but slightly different in that
only a subset of the nonwords were included in Experiment 2. The resynthesis
of the experimental stimuli was done based on the average values reported in
Table 4.
The experimental stimuli were resynthesized such that stress would be conveyed
by both F0 and duration (“F0 + duration cues” condition), by F0 alone (“F0 cue”
condition), by duration alone (“duration cue” condition), or by conﬂicting F0 and
duration (“conﬂicting cues” condition). The F0 + duration cues condition serves
as the baseline, in that it contains two suprasegmental cues that signal stress in
English nonwords. The F0 cue condition and the duration cue condition serve as
experimental conditions, with the understanding that their comparison to the F0 +
duration cues condition reﬂects the degree to which performance becomes more
impaired upon the removal of, respectively, duration cue or F0 cue. Finally, in the
conﬂicting cues condition, the F0 and duration cues contradict each other, such
that a syllable with higher F0 is shorter and a syllable with lower F0 is longer.
This last condition makes it possible to determine whether listeners weigh one
cue more than the other when encoding stress patterns. Thus, the conﬂicting cues
condition speciﬁes the relative importance of F0 and duration cues in listeners’
encoding of English stress.

Recall that all the stimuli had ﬁrst been normalized for intensity at 70 dB. The
F0 and duration cues were then manipulated with PSOLA in Praat (Boersma &
Weenink, 2012) such that the nonwords had the average F0 and/or duration of the
natural stimuli reported in Table 4. Thus, in the condition where F0 was the only
cue to stress, the duration of each syllable corresponded to the average duration
across both syllables and stress patterns (i.e., 249 ms) in Table 4.8 In the condition
where duration was the only cue to stress, the F0 of each syllable corresponded to
the average F0 across both syllables and stress patterns (i.e., 189 Hz) in Table 4.

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:3
Qin et al.: Processing of word-level stress

555

In the condition where both F0 and duration converged, the resynthesized stimuli
had the exact values reported in Table 4. In the condition where F0 and duration
conﬂicted, F0 and duration measurements were swapped across stress patterns
such that the stimuli could be considered as having initial or ﬁnal stress depending
on whether listeners attended to F0 or duration.

Procedures. The sequence-recall task in Experiment 2 had only a testing phase,
as the participants completed the familiarization (or association) test in Experiment
1 and completed Experiment 2 approximately 5 min after Experiment 1. In the
testing phase, participants were asked to recall sequences of four tokens by pressing
1 and 2 in the correct order. Each test trial began with the auditory presentation
of a sequence that included two stress-initial tokens and two stress-ﬁnal tokens
with the same segments (e.g., [fʌ'ði] ['fʌði] ['fʌði] [fʌ'ði]) or two /t/-initial and two
/k/-ﬁnal tokens (e.g., [tɪvi] [kɪvi] [kɪvi] [tɪvi]). For the experimental stimuli, each
sequence consisted of four different tokens from the same cue condition (F0 +
duration cues, F0 cue, duration cue, or conﬂicting cues). To shorten the duration
of the experiment, for both experimental and ﬁller stimuli, three of the six possible
sequences (i.e., [1122], [2211], [1212], [1221], [2121], [2112]) were used for two
nonwords, and the other three possibilities were used for the other two nonwords.
The order of sequences and of tokens within each sequence was randomized across
participants. The experiment included 48 experimental sequences (4 segmental
nonwords×4 conditions×3 orders) and 48 ﬁller sequences (4 segmental nonword
pairs×4 repetitions×3 orders). The experimental and ﬁller trials were presented in
different blocks. The rest of the procedures were identical to those of Experiment
1. The experiment took 20–25 min to complete.

Data analysis and predictions. The ﬁrst two analyses focused on participants’
accuracy with stimuli that differed in stress. Logit mixed-effects models were
conducted on the participants’ sequence-encoding accuracy in the ﬁrst three ex-
perimental conditions. A ﬁrst model analyzed the accuracy of the three groups,
with cue condition (F0 + duration cues, F0 cue, and duration cue; baseline = F0 +
duration cues), L1 (English, SM, and TM; baseline = English), and the interaction
between the two as ﬁxed effects and with participant, test item, trial order, and
sequence order (e.g., [1122], [2211], etc.) as crossed random effects. A second
model analyzed only the L2 learners’ accuracy, with cue condition (F0 + duration
cues, F0 cue, and duration cue; baseline = F0 + duration cues), L1 dialect (SM
and TM; baseline = SM), proﬁciency (centered cloze-test scores, as obtained for
Experiment 1), and all interactions as ﬁxed effects, and with participant, test item,
trial order, and sequence order as crossed random effects.

The results in the conﬂicting cues condition were analyzed separately because
they did not yield the same dependent variable as the previous three conditions.
In this condition, because F0 and duration cues conﬂicted, the stress pattern of
each word in the sequence could not be unequivocally identiﬁed. Participants’
responses were therefore coded based on the use of F0 or duration cues to identify
the stress patterns. For the use of F0, the recalled stress patterns were deemed to be
“accurate” if the word for which the initial syllable had a higher F0 was identiﬁed
as 1 and if the word for which the ﬁnal syllable had a higher F0 was identiﬁed as 2.

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:3
Qin et al.: Processing of word-level stress

556

For the use of duration, the recalled stress patterns were deemed to be “accurate”
if the word with a longer initial syllable was identiﬁed as 1 and if the word with
a longer ﬁnal syllable was identiﬁed as 2. The sequence “accuracy” computed on
the basis of these two different coding thus reﬂect listeners’ consistent use of F0
versus duration cues to English stress when these two cues are pitted against each
other.9

Logit mixed-effects models were conducted on the participants’ accuracy in
the conﬂicting cues condition. A ﬁrst model analyzed all participants’ accuracy
in their use of F0, with L1 (English, SM, and TM; baseline = English) as ﬁxed
effect, and with participant, test item, trial order, and sequence order as crossed
random effects. A second model analyzed L2 learners’ accuracy in their use of F0,
with L1 dialect (SM and TM; baseline = SM), proﬁciency (centered cloze-test
scores), and their interaction as ﬁxed effects, and with participant, test item, trial
order, and sequence order as crossed random effects. A third model analyzed all
participants’ accuracy in their use of duration, with L1 (English, SM, and TM;
baseline = English) as ﬁxed effect, and with participant, test item, trial order, and
sequence order as crossed random effects. Finally, a fourth model analyzed L2
learners’ accuracy in their use of duration, with L1 dialect (SM and TM; baseline=
SM), proﬁciency (centered cloze-test scores), and their interaction as ﬁxed effects,
and with participant, test item, trial order, and sequence order as crossed random
effects.10 The last two mixed-effects models analyzed participants’ sequence-
encoding accuracy on the test items that differed in their initial consonant (i.e., the
ﬁller items), with either L1 (all participants) or L1 dialect (L2 learners) as ﬁxed
effect.

For each analysis, ﬁxed effects were removed from the initial (i.e., most com-
plex) model one at a time, and model comparisons were run in pairwise fashion
to determine if the more complex model accounted for signiﬁcantly more of the
variance, as determined by log-likelihood ratio tests. We report the simplest model
that accounted for signiﬁcantly more of the variance than simpler models. When-
ever L1 or L1 dialect interacted with cue conditions (in the ﬁrst set of analyses),
subsequent models were performed separately on the native speakers’ and L2
learners’ accuracy within each cue condition. For all post hoc comparisons, we
adjusted the alpha level using the Bonferroni correction.

Given the results of Experiment 1, TM listeners are predicted to transfer their
use of F0 cues from lexical tones in TM to stress in English, even if TM does not
have word-level stress. If they do so, in the ﬁrst set of analyses, we should not ﬁnd
signiﬁcant interactions between the effect of the F0 cue (as compared to the F0
+ duration baseline) and the effects of L1 dialect, because F0 is a cue to lexical
identity in both TM and SM (due to lexical tones). However, if TM listeners are
less reliant on duration as a cue to lexical identity than SM listeners are, in the
ﬁrst set of analyses, we should ﬁnd signiﬁcant interactions between the effect
of the duration cue (as compared to the F0 + duration baseline) and the effect
L1 dialect, with TM-speaking L2 learners of English showing a larger difference
between the duration cue condition and the baseline condition than SM-speaking
L2 learners of English. Furthermore, we may ﬁnd in the second set of results that
TM listeners make weaker use of duration and stronger use of F0 than SM listeners
when duration is pitted against F0.

Results. The accuracy of participants’ sequence encoding in the F0 + duration,
F0, and duration cue conditions is shown for the three groups in Figure 3. The best
logit mixed-effects model of all three groups’ accuracy in the ﬁrst three prosodic
cue conditions included L1, cue condition, and their interaction as ﬁxed effects.
Table 5 summarizes the results of this model. The model revealed signiﬁcant
effects of suprasegmental cue for the duration cue condition (as compared to the
F0 + duration cues condition), as well as signiﬁcant interactions between duration
cue condition and L1 for both the SM and TM groups. This interaction indicates
that both the SM-speaking and the TM-speaking L2 learners of English showed
a larger difference between the F0 + duration cues condition and the duration
cue condition as compared to the English group. In other words, both L2 groups

showed greater difﬁculty than English listeners in encoding stress when stress
was realized only with duration. The model did not reveal a signiﬁcant effect of
suprasegmental cue for the F0 cue condition or a signiﬁcant interaction between
the F0 cue condition and L1 for either the SM group or the TM group. These
results indicate that both groups of L2 learners differ from native English listeners
in their use of duration, but not in their use of F0, to encode stress in English
nonwords.

The best logit mixed-effect model on L2 learners’ accuracy included L1, cue
condition, L2 proﬁciency, and all interactions as ﬁxed effects. Table 6 summarizes
the results of this model. The results revealed a signiﬁcant effect of supraseg-
mental cue for the duration cue condition (as compared to the F0 + duration
cues condition), as well as a signiﬁcant interaction between suprasegmental cue
for the duration cue condition and L1 dialect. This interaction indicates that the
TM-speaking L2 learners of English showed a larger difference between the F0 +
duration cues condition and the duration cue condition than did the SM-speaking
L2 learners of English. The model did not reveal a signiﬁcant effect of supraseg-
mental cue for the F0 cue condition or a signiﬁcant interaction between the F0
cue condition and L1 dialect. Furthermore, none of the ﬁxed effects involving L2
proﬁciency were signiﬁcant, suggesting that L2 proﬁciency did not inﬂuence L2
learners’ performance on the task. These results indicate that both groups of L2
learners differ from each other in their use of duration, but not in their use of F0,
to encode stress in English nonwords.

Given the signiﬁcant interaction effects in the previous two models, post hoc
analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of L1 and L1 dialect separately
for the F0 + duration cues condition and the duration cue condition. While the
three groups did not differ from each other in the F0 + duration cues condition (z
< |1|), they did in the duration cue condition: the native English listeners outper-
formed both the SM listeners, z (538) = –3.3, p < .001, and the TM listeners, z

In summary, the SM-speaking and TM-speaking L2 learners of English pat-
terned similarly in the use of the F0 to encode stress in English nonwords. However,
in the condition where only duration signaled stress, the two L2 groups differed
statistically. Overall, these results suggest that the TM-speaking L2 learners of
English had more difﬁculty using duration as a cue to stress than the SM-speaking
L2 learners of English.

The participants’ responses in the conﬂicting cues condition were also analyzed
to investigate the relative importance of F0 and duration for each group. Figure 4
shows participants’ accuracy when using F0 or duration as a cue to stress.

The best logit mixed-effects model on all three groups’ accuracy in the use of
F0 in conﬂicting cues condition did not include L1 as ﬁxed effect (i.e., L1 did not
signiﬁcantly improve the model). This means that the English listeners did not
differ from either the SM-speaking L2 learners or the TM-speaking L2 learners in
their reliance on F0. The best logit mixed-effects model on L2 learners’ accuracy
in their use of F0 in the cue-conﬂicting condition included L2 proﬁciency, but
not L1 dialect, as ﬁxed effect (i.e., L1 dialect did not signiﬁcantly improve the
model). However, the results of this model did not reveal a signiﬁcant effect of
L2 proﬁciency, z (359) = 1.2, p > .05. This suggests that the two groups of L2
learners did not differ from each other in their use of F0, and L2 proﬁciency did not
affect L2 learners’ performance in their use of F0 when it conﬂicted with duration
in signaling stress.

The best logit mixed-effects model on all three groups’ accuracy in their use
of duration cue in the conﬂicting cues condition included L1 as ﬁxed effect. The
results revealed that the English listeners differed from both the SM-speaking L2
learners, z (538) = –2.0, p < .05, and the TM-speaking L2 learners, z (538) =
–2.7, p < .01, in their use of duration. The best logit mixed-effects model on L2
learners’ accuracy in their use of duration in the conﬂicting cues condition did not

include any ﬁxed effect (i.e., neither L1 dialect nor L2 proﬁciency signiﬁcantly
improved the model). This means that the two groups of L2 learners did not differ
from each other in their use of duration cue, and L2 proﬁciency did not affect
L2 learners’ performance in their use of duration when it conﬂicted with F0 in
signaling stress.

These results suggest that in the presence of conﬂicting suprasegmental cues,
both L2 groups prioritized F0 over duration, and did so similarly. This suggests
that F0 is a stronger cue to lexical identity in both SM and TM, to such a degree
that differences between the two L2 groups in their relative reliance on duration
cues did not emerge in the conﬂicting cues condition.11

Finally, the accuracy of the participants’ sequence encoding for stimuli that
differed in initial consonant is shown in Figure 5. A logit mixed-effects model
was conducted on all participants’ sequence encoding accuracy with stimuli that
differed in their initial consonant. This model is summarized in Table 7. The results
of this analysis suggest that English listeners outperformed SM and TM listeners
in their encoding of segments (i.e., /t/ vs. /k/) in English nonwords. However, the
best logit mixed-effect models on L2 learners’ accuracy did not include any ﬁxed

effect, indicating that SM and TM listeners did not differ from each other in their
processing of initial /t/ vs. /k/ in English nonwords.

Discussion. The results of the second experiment shed important light on how
suprasegmental cues to lexical identity in the L1 modulate listeners’ encoding of
stress in the L2. When stress was signaled with F0 cues (both in the F0 condition
and in the conﬂicting cues condition), the SM- and TM-speaking L2 learners of
English did not differ from each other (or from native English listeners). This
suggests that TM listeners, who do not have word-level stress in their L1 dialect,
were successful at transferring the use of F0 cues from lexical tones in the L1 to
stress in the L2. We hypothesize that TM listeners did not differ from SM listeners
because both Mandarin dialects have lexical tones, which are signaled primarily
by F0 and play an important role in Mandarin lexical access.

However, when stress was signaled only with duration cues, TM-speaking L2
learners of English performed less accurately on the task than SM-speaking L2
learners of English. These results indicate that when cues to stress do not conﬂict,
L2 learners differ in their ability to use these cues as a function of their relative
weight in the L1. In SM but not in TM, duration is used to encode a stress
distinction (i.e., stressed–stressed vs. stressed–unstressed); we hypothesize that
this use of duration in SM is what allows SM-speaking L2 learners of English to
encode English stress in the duration condition.

At the same time, both groups of L2 learners performed less accurately than
native English listeners in the use of duration both when duration cues were
isolated (duration condition) and when they conﬂicted with F0 cues (conﬂicting
cues condition). One possibility is that the greater occurrence of vowel reduction
in English than in Mandarin as well as the use of duration as one of the cues that
contrasts tense and lax vowels (e.g., /i/ vs. /ɪ/) in English may have led English
listeners to be generally more sensitive to duration as a cue to stress as compared
to Mandarin listeners (Lin et al., 2014, p. 334). Alternatively, SM may have
fewer words that contrast in stress placement as compared to English (Duanmu,
2007), thus potentially leading SM-speaking L2 learners of English to rely less on
duration cue as a cue to stress as compared to native English listeners.

It is interesting that TM listeners did not differ statistically from SM listeners
when duration conﬂicted with F0 in the experimental stimuli. We hypothesize
that L2 learners’ weaker reliance on duration (where they differed from native
listeners) than on F0 (where they did not differ from native listeners) may have
prevented any effect of L1 dialect from emerging when F0 and duration conﬂicted
in signaling stress. In other words, in the presence of conﬂicting suprasegmental
information, both groups of L2 learners tuned it primarily to F0, because F0 is a
more important cue to lexical identity in both SM and TM.

It is important that, when encoding English nonwords that contrasted in word-
initial /t/ and /k/, SM and TM listeners did not differ from each other but performed
less accurately than English listeners. As in Experiment 1, we attribute these results
to differences between English and Mandarin in their phonetic realizations of the
target segments (e.g., English /t/ is alveolar whereas Mandarin /t/ is dental) and in
their phonotactics (e.g., the lax vowels following /t/ and /k/ in the stimuli are not
permitted in Mandarin).

GENERAL DISCUSSION

562

This study investigated whether the suprasegmental cues to prominence that con-
vey lexical identity in the L1 transfer to the encoding of stress in L2 processing.
The results of the ﬁrst experiment, which used natural stimuli where F0 and
duration cues co-occurred, showed that native English listeners and SM-speaking
L2 learners of English did not have an advantage over TM-speaking L2 learners
in processing stress in English nonwords. By contrast, the results of the second
experiment, which used resynthesized stimuli where F0 and duration cues were
isolated, revealed an advantage for the SM-speaking L2 learners (and native En-
glish listeners) over the TM-speaking L2 learners when duration was the only cue
signaling stress, but not when F0 signaled stress.

These results are important, because they suggest that L2 learners whose L1
does not have word-level stress (e.g., TM) can transfer the use of a suprasegmental
cue (here, F0) from a different phonological category (i.e., lexical tones) to word-
level stress in the L2. Furthermore, these results suggest that L2 learners differ
in their ability to use a particular suprasegmental cue to stress (here, duration) as
a function of the relative weight of that cue in the L1 (e.g., SM vs. TM). From
an L2 learning perspective, the difﬁculty that L2 learners face thus appears to be
complex, with L2 learners needing to associate speciﬁc suprasegmental cues to
prominence (e.g., F0, duration, and intensity) with lexical representations (e.g.,
word stress) and use this information to encode and access words (e.g., Cooper
et al., 2002; Cutler, 2012; Zhang & Francis, 2010).

Our results can be interpreted within a cue-weighting theory of speech per-
ception (e.g., Francis & Nusbaum, 2002; Holt & Lotto, 2006; Invalgson et al.,
2011; Zhang & Francis, 2010). According to this theory, the contribution of indi-
vidual acoustic cues to distinguish among lexical items in the L1 determines the
weight of these cues in the L2. This means that if a particular suprasegmental cue
plays an important role in L1 lexical access, it could be used to encode stress in
the L2, even if the L1 does not have word-level stress; by the same token, if a
particular suprasegmental cue plays a limited role in L1 lexical access, then L2
learners should have difﬁculty using this cue in the L2. This suggests that the
mechanisms underlying stress processing do not operate strictly as a function of
whether or not the L1 has word-level stress (for discussions, see also Lin et al.,
2014; Tremblay, 2008, 2009). A cue-weighting theory of speech perception also
assumes that the more important a cue is in the L1, the more it is used in L2
processing (e.g., Francis & Nusbaum, 2002; Holt & Lotto, 2006; Iverson et al.,
2003; McAllister, Flege, & Piske, 2002). Hence, this theory can explain not only
the circumstances under which L2 learners can or cannot encode L2 English word
stress but also how they encode L2 English word stress for the purpose of rec-
ognizing L2 words. Our results show that the two groups of Mandarin-speaking
L2 learners differed from native English listeners only in their use of duration
cues to English stress. These results are consistent with the predictions of the cue-
weighting account in that F0 is an important cue to lexical identity in Mandarin,
arguably more than the stress–unstressed contrast signaled by duration in SM; con-
sequently, F0 cues are used more than duration cues in the processing of English
no-words.

563

Another signiﬁcant contribution of this study is in showing that not only the
L1 but also the L1 dialect plays a crucial role in determining whether or not
L2 learners can use speciﬁc suprasegmental cues to encode stress in English
nonwords. Many studies have investigated how the L1 inﬂuences the processing
of L2 stress (e.g., Cutler, 2012; Dupoux et al., 2001, 2008; Zhang & Francis,
2010), and a growing number of studies have investigated how the L1 dialect
modulates the perception of L2 segments (e.g., Chl´adkov´a & Podlipsk´y, 2011;
Colantoni et al., 2015; Escudero et al., 2012; Escudero & Williams, 2011; Mayr &
Escudero, 2010). To date, however, little work had been devoted to the inﬂuence
of L1 dialects on L2 speech perception at the suprasegmental level. The present
study ﬁlls this gap, and its results suggest that L2 speech processing models should
consider the inﬂuence of L1 dialect, as it may impact how suprasegmental cues
are weighed in L2 processing. Other studies have raised the possibility that the L1
dialect may be a factor to consider in the perception of L2 stress (e.g., Tremblay,
2008, 2009). In our study, the inﬂuence of the L1 dialect is assumed to be caused
by the speciﬁc suprasegmental characteristics of the two languages (i.e., SM and
TM). Further research should attempt to replicate the present ﬁndings with other
L1 dialect–L2 pairings.

It should be emphasized that the effect of L1 dialect does not imply that TM
listeners are not capable of using duration as a cue to stress, but rather that they
will be less reliant on duration than SM listeners because of the weaker role of
duration in TM as compared to SM (e.g., TM listeners may still make weak use
of this cue in the recognition of Mandarin words; Liu & Samuel, 2004). What is
crucial here is that unlike SM, TM does not have a stress contrast cued by duration
cues; as a result, TM and SM differ in the extent to which duration signals lexical
identity. Accordingly, TM listeners will be less reliant than SM listeners on the
use of duration as a cue in the processing of English stress.

Given the methodology used in this study, one question that arises is whether
our results would be generalizable to real words. Because English does not have
many minimal pairs that differ only in the suprasegmental cues to stress (for
discussion, see Cutler, 1986), using nonwords was the only possible option for
the present experimental design (and doing so also made it possible to avoid the
potentially confounding effects of word frequency and word familiarity). It may
be easier to test the processing of L2 stress with (frequency-matched) real words in
target languages that do not have vowel reduction (e.g., Spanish), unlike English.
Further research should attempt to replicate our ﬁndings in such languages using
real words.

Conclusion

In summary, this study examined how English listeners and proﬁciency-matched
SM- and TM-speaking L2 learners of English encode stress in English nonwords.
The results indicated that all three groups performed similarly when processing
nonwords that contained F0 cues. However, when stress was signaled only with
duration, TM listeners had more difﬁculty than SM listeners (and native English
listeners) in encoding stress. Furthermore, both L2 groups relied less on duration
cues than native English listeners did, a ﬁnding that was attributed to L2 learners’

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:3

564

greater reliance on F0 due to the importance of lexical tones for lexical access in
Mandarin. These results were interpreted within a cue-weighting theory of speech
perception, which can provide a straightforward explanation of whether and how
L2 learners encode English stress.

NOTES

1. The symbols in brackets are IPA symbols with tone markers representing the contour

of the lexical tone.

2. The present study focuses on F0 and duration cues rather than on intensity cues to
stress, because clearer predictions can be made about F0 and duration cues based
on the differences of stress patterns between SM and TM. That is, while F0 is a
primary cue to lexical tones in both SM and TM, duration is a primary cue to stress
patterns in SM only. Intensity is less important than other cues (e.g., duration) in the
comparison, and thus left out.

3. None of the SM-speaking participants knew other Chinese languages, but four of
them spoke other varieties of Mandarin Chinese. Two of them spoke Southwestern
Mandarin, one spoke Central Plains Mandarin, and one spoke Jiao-Liao Mandarin.
We kept these four participants in our analysis because the Mandarin varieties they
knew are similar to SM in their prosodic systems (Norman, 1988), and these partici-
pants reported using SM as their dominant language.

Two of the TM-speaking participants also spoke Taiwanese. Like in TM, duration
does not signal word-level stress in Taiwanese. However, duration can be a stronger
cue to lexical tones in Taiwanese than in TM, because checked tones and smooth
tones differ in duration in Taiwanese (Peng, 1997; Yip, 2002). For this reason, we ran
our statistical analyses with and without these two participants. The results of the two
different analyses were exactly the same. We therefore kept these two participants in
our analyses.

4. The lack of signiﬁcant difference between the two learner groups may also be due
to the large variance in learners’ length of residence (e.g., the standard deviation for
the TM-speaking group is twice as large as the mean).

5. We also analyzed the effect of length of residence on the TM-speaking participants’
performance to see if the participants recruited and tested in the United States and
in Taiwan behaved differently due to their different degrees of exposure to American
English. We report these analyses in endnotes.

6. The results of the ﬁller stimuli are reported, but the discussion of ﬁller stimuli is kept

to a minimum due to space restrictions.

7. An additional logit mixed-effects model was conducted on the TM group’s sequence-
encoding accuracy, this time with length of residence as a ﬁxed effect. Length of
residence did not improve the base model, which suggests that the performance of
the TM-speaking L2 learners of English did not differ as a function of their exposure
to American English.

8. The word-ﬁnal lengthening that occurred in the natural stimuli was not preserved
in order to resynthesize duration cues similarly to F0 cues. That is, any durational
and F0 difference between Syllable 1 and Syllable 2 in disyllabic nonwords were
removed in, respectively, the F0 cue condition and the duration cue condition.

9. Note that these two different codings of the results in the conﬂicting cues condition
are necessary, because the difference between the highest possible “accuracy” on
the task (i.e., 100%) and the sequence encoding accuracy based on one cue does

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:3

566

not equal the sequence encoding accuracy based on the other cue. This is because
listeners may shift reliance from one cue (e.g., F0) to the other (e.g., duration) within
a given sequence; such a sequence would be considered inaccurate whether or not
accuracy is computed on the basis of F0 or duration.
In the conﬂicting cues condition, listeners’ reliance on F0 and their reliance on
duration could not be directly compared, as they are not independent (i.e., the higher
their reliance on duration, the lower their reliance on F0).

10.

11. Additional logit mixed-effect models were conducted on the TM-speaking partici-
pants’ accuracy with length of residence as a ﬁxed factor. Adding length of residence
to the models did not improve any of them, indicating that the performance of the
TM-speaking L2 learners of English did not differ as a function of their exposure to
American English.
