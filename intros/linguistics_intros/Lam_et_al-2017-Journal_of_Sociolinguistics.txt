INTRODUCTION.
In his bestseller The World is Flat, Friedman (2007) portrays a world in which
technological changes have ‘ﬂattened the playing ﬁeld’ by equalising
opportunities among individuals. Long before this metaphor of ﬂatness was
made popular in the understanding of globalisation, what might be referred to
as a ‘ﬂat earth’ approach has dominated the discourse of academic disciplines
on spatial geographies as in geopolitics, urban design and critical urban
research. It is therefore unsurprising that this discursive ﬂattening is also found
in other academic domains where landscape is a prime concern, as in research
on linguistic landscapes, and more generally, on semiotic landscapes.

The persistent neglect of the vertical landscape in ‘an overly ﬂat discourse’
(Graham and Hewitt 2012: 72) as seen in these disciplines, however, is at odds
with the human spatial experience, which is essentially three-dimensional and
volumetric. Furthermore, such neglect overlooks the fact that high-rise
architecture has become an iconic and ubiquitous feature in contemporary
cityscapes in an increasingly urbanised world. Of course, tall buildings are
nothing new. By the late nineteenth century, multi-storey structures were
already in place, at least since the Home Insurance Building in Chicago – often
regarded as the world’s ﬁrst modern skyscraper – was completed in 1885.
However, it was not until the last decade or so, when computing power
brought about major technological advances in architecture and engineering,
that the construction of supertall buildings of theoretically unlimited heights
became possible (Al-Kodmany 2011). While it remains to be seen whether
supertall buildings will become the future architectural norm, it is generally
expected that skyscrapers will continue to grow in number, scale and height. A
call for the study and theorisation of verticality in landscape-related research is
therefore not only essential but pressing.

In this regard, nowhere in the world is a more ﬁtting research site for
understanding the vertical landscape than Hong Kong. Situated at the south-
eastern tip of China, Hong Kong is characterised by a unique landscape
combining hilly terrain with a deep harbour. Of the 1105 square km of total
land area (Hong Kong Lands Department 2014), approximately 45 percent
possesses an elevation of at least 100 metres above sea level.2 The bulk of this
rugged landscape is thus composed of steep slopes, rendering it relatively
unsuitable for development. Only about a quarter of the land is currently
developed for residential, commercial, industrial and other urban uses. The
remaining three quarters is mainly composed of woodland, grassland and
wetland which are scattered across the territory (Hong Kong Planning
Department 2014). With a population of over seven million people (Hong
Kong Census and Statistics Department 2014), Hong Kong is the eighth most
densely populated urban area in the world (Demographia 2015: 108). High-
rise and high-density buildings are therefore a direct response to the large
population in a small city of distinct topography. This is unlike in Dubai, for
instance, where the aim of vertical expansion is not to address land-shortage
problems but to showcase the city’s wealth and to mark its global position (Al-
Kodmany 2011).

Hong Kong is unique in terms of both its scale and pattern of verticality.
Among the Paciﬁc Rim regions, Hong Kong was the ﬁrst to begin the
development of tall buildings in the 1970s. In less than half a century, Hong
Kong has become the city with the highest number of skyscrapers in the world,
surpassing New York and Dubai (The Skyscraper Center 2015). Almost 90
percent of the city’s population live in high-rise buildings (Wang and Lau
2013). Compared with New York and Chicago which are both archetypal
vertical cities with skyscrapers highly concentrated at the core, Hong Kong is
exceptional in the sense that verticality is not only found at the centre but also
across the whole city (Chau 2011). Hong Kong, on several counts, can hence
be regarded as the world’s most vertical city, making it an ideal location for
researching the vertical dimension of linguistic landscapes.

RESEARCHING THE DISCURSIVE AND MATERIAL LANDSCAPES.
Landscape-related research in linguistics and semiotics primarily concerns the
ways in which the physical landscape is deﬁned and communicated discursively
in space through the use of language and other semiotic resources. Such
research has long been strongly oriented to the study of public spaces in urban
contexts. This is evident, for example, in the ﬁrst deﬁnition of the term linguistic
landscape by Landry and Bourhis (1997: 25), which focused on such urban
signage as ‘advertising billboards’ and ‘commercial shop signs’. Similarly,
when conceptualising the notion semiotic landscape, Jaworski and Thurlow
(2010: 2) emphasised how language, as one of the available semiotic
resources, interacts with such urban modalities as ‘architecture and the
built environment’, in deﬁning a place. Given the overwhelming majority of
research in linguistic and semiotic landscapes in urban areas, it has been
suggested that cityscape might be a better word for the subject under
investigation (see, for example, Gorter 2006; Spolsky 2009).

Despite this strong orientation to the study of the urban linguistic and
semiotic landscapes, there has been a curious absence of scholarly attention to
verticality. Previous studies thus far have mainly dealt with signs at street
level, overlooking the relationship between signs and skyscrapers or
underground railways, structures which increasingly characterise cities and
urban life. Studies of the linguistic and semiotic landscapes of Hong Kong are
no exception. Largely conceptualising the city as a horizontal surface, these
studies have explored the interrelationship between particular regional areas of
Hong Kong and patterns of signage, while addressing such issues as
multilingualism, language proﬁciency and post-colonialism.

In this former colony of Britain, Chinese and English remain the ofﬁcial
languages after its handover to China in 1997. The language policy of the
Hong Kong government is to promote ‘biliteracy and trilingualism’ amongst
the population. Cantonese is the mother tongue or usual language of an
overwhelming majority (88–90%) of the predominantly ethnic Chinese
population, while Mandarin has recently overtaken English as the second
most commonly spoken language (48% vs. 46%) (Hong Kong Census and

Statistics Department 2011, 2016). A recent linguistic survey showed an
increasing trilingualism amongst younger speakers in the city (Bacon-Shone,
Bolton and Luke 2015). In addition, census data shows that Hong Kong is
home to twenty-four minority languages, each spoken by at
least one thousand residents. These include Filipino, Indonesian, and other Asian
languages (Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department 2016). The extent of
multilingualism in the horizontal landscape of the city is hence a common
research theme.

In a study of signs on residential buildings in Hong Kong, for example,
Jaworski and Yeung (2010) showed the differences in semiotic choices as
displayed in property-name signs among three broad geographical areas of
varying degrees of afﬂuence. In the working-class neighbourhood, there were
more monolingual Chinese signs when compared with the more afﬂuent areas,
and signs were more functional in nature. By contrast, signs from the most
privileged neighbourhood were more likely to be monolingual in English and
were more decorative in nature, invoking a sense of grandeur. Similar
differences were also found in Finzel (2012), who studied the linkage between
the language choice of shop signs and the language proﬁciency of shopkeepers
in two geographical areas of Hong Kong. It was found that shops in the old
working-class district had more monolingual Chinese signs and had staff who
spoke little English. In the middle-class district, more monolingual English
signs were found and the employees were able to converse in English at the
shops. These ﬁndings indicate that the horizontal linguistic landscape of Hong
Kong, speciﬁcally, the language choice on signs, is sensitive to the socio-
economic background of the local residents.

Focusing more on the postcolonial inﬂuence from mainland China on the
linguistic landscape of the city after the change of sovereignty, Lai (2013)
examined signage at four geographical sites in Hong Kong with differing
proximity to the border with mainland China. It was found that the closer the
site was to the border, the more frequent was the use of simpliﬁed Chinese on
signs. As simpliﬁed Chinese is the form of written Chinese used in mainland
China but not in Hong Kong, its presence on signs nearer the border may
signal the impact of ‘mainlandisation’. The linguistic divide at this intra-
national border is also the topic of interest in Danielewicz-Betz and Graddol
(2014) and Graddol and Danielewicz-Betz (2015), who found that Hong Kong
and Shenzhen, its closest neighbour across the border, were distinct in their
language landscapes in terms of romanisation, lexical choice and preference for
the exonormative variety of English. Traditional Chinese, simpliﬁed Chinese
and English can thus each be seen to have a distinct visual identity in the city.
Following Scollon and Scollon (2003: xii), we consider emplacement, i.e. ‘the
physical location of language in the world’, to be central to the understanding
of any sign. We further argue that the meaning of a sign is dependent not only
upon where it is placed horizontally but also, equally importantly, where it is
placed vertically. The inclusion of this missing z-coordinate on the map of
landscape research thus presents a crucial yet long overdue perspective,
allowing the landscape to be seen in full in three-dimensional space.
It is with this focus that we now turn to studies of the material landscape to
see how insights into verticality from such disciplines as architecture,
geography and urban studies can inform a more comprehensive
understanding of the discursive landscape. Partly overlapping with the
discursive landscape, the material landscape mainly concerns the ways in
which the physical landscape is defined and communicated materially in space
through the use of architectural and other physical forms. Two material design
features peculiar to the vertical landscape of Hong Kong are of particular
relevance here: the multiple intensive land use (MILU) model and the podium
form.
In response to the continuous arrival of immigrants from mainland China
since the early 1960s and the economic boom in the 70s and 80s, the
government in Hong Kong introduced a Buildings Ordinance in 1970 to
permit the design and construction of tall buildings for mixed use. This urban
development policy resulted in low-rise shop-houses giving way to high-rise
buildings, which forever changed the skyline of Hong Kong. Over the years,
new building regulations have been enforced not only to increase the overall
floor-to-area ratio of such mixed-use buildings but also the non-domestic
proportion, allowing developers to enlarge the retail floor area at the lower end
of a building for higher rental returns. Since then, Hong Kong has seen the
proliferation of increasingly multi-functional high-density skyscrapers, with an
oversized podium as a characteristic, if not defining, feature.
In these so-called composite developments, offices or residential apartments
are housed together with facilities for other uses within one single tower block.
The most common uses identified in representative MILU projects in the city
are residential, commercial, recreational, community facilities and transport
facilities (Lau, Giridharan and Ganesan 2005). A mixed-use tower in Hong
Kong is thus in essence a microcosm of the city, a synthesis of public and
private spaces for different social practices performed by a range of social actors
in one vertical structure. In this respect, the now ubiquitous podium form in
these MILU projects has been hailed as a form of public space with social
significance (Shelton, Karakiewicz and Kvan 2011). Elevated above the
ground, the podium is a horizontal transfer structure at the base of a
skyscraper, whose orientation and width differ from that of the skyscraper’s
tower (Skyscraper Dictionary 2013–2014). As a raised platform often
encompassing several floors to support the weight of the tower above, the
podium regularly serves the important function of demarcating public and
private spaces. Under the roof of the podium, commercial and transport
facilities such as car parks, transport interchanges and shopping arcades are
commonly found. Above the deck rise the stacks of commercial or residential
towers. In the case of the latter, the podium terrace is reserved for recreational
and communal facilities including landscaped gardens, playgrounds and sports
amenities, all of which are often used exclusively by the gated communities of
residents living in the towers sitting atop the podium.

These two interrelated design features characterising much of the vertical
dimension of the contemporary material landscape of Hong Kong have profound
implications for its discursive landscape. In the discussion which follows, we
explore the means and forms in which the vertical landscape can be visually
deﬁned and communicated by focusing on one of the most recent and
representative composite urban projects at the business and ﬁnance hub of
Hong Kong, namely the megastructure of the International Finance Centre.
Through this case study, we illustrate the dialogical interaction between the
discursive and material landscapes in a vertical layout. In the process, we
address the more critical issues surrounding social actors, practices, types of
space and levels of access in order to reveal how the vertical landscape reﬂects
and at the same time shapes the changing socio-economic and ideological fabric
of the city in the rising tide of globalisation, consumerism and mainlandisation.

THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CENTRE (IFC).
Located at the heart of Central, the central business district of the city on
reclaimed land, the International Finance Centre (IFC, branded in lower case as
‘ifc’) is one of the largest MILU projects in Hong Kong. As part of the Airport
Core Programme, the ifc project was initiated in the early 1990s to connect the
Hong Kong International Airport, which is situated on an outlying island, to
the ﬁnancial core of Hong Kong via an express train (Figure 1).

Jointly developed by a consortium of property developers and ﬁnanciers, the
ifc complex is a commercial, retail and hotel development sited on the
waterfront. The major components of the complex were completed in three
phases from 1998 to 2005: two ofﬁce towers, a shopping mall, and a hotel.
With a total gross ﬂoor area of 4,700,000 square feet on a total site area of
430,000 square feet, this megastructure is claimed to offer ‘a truly inspiring
working, shopping and living experience’ (International Finance Centre
Management Co. Ltd 2015: ‘About us’).

The 39-storey Tower 1 (known as One ifc) and the 88-storey Tower 2
(known as Two ifc) provide high-quality ofﬁce space to accommodate up to
20,000 ofﬁce workers. The major tenants of the ofﬁce towers include some of
the world’s leading banks and international ﬁnancial institutions. These two
skyscrapers are linked by the ifc mall, which occupies a four-level podium, with
more than 200 stores featuring mid-range to high-end international brands.
Also connected to the podium is a 5-star hotel. With 399 guest rooms and 519
serviced apartments, the luxury hotel offers top-of-the-range accommodation
options for both short and long-term stays.

On the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the podium, access on foot to a number of neighbouring
commercial buildings and public facilities, including a post ofﬁce and ferry
piers, is provided by a network of covered elevated walkways and footbridges.
On top of the podium sits a roof garden, open to the public, with bars and views
over the harbour. Below the podium lies the ground ﬂoor and a six-level
basement. One part of the basement houses the car parks of the two ofﬁce
towers, offering 1,800 parking bays. Another part of the basement is Hong
Kong Station, which belongs to the only railway and metro company of the
city. The station occupies the ground ﬂoor and four stories underground. In the
basement, its facilities include a metro station, an airport express station, a
station car park with 277 parking bays, and a number of shops and
restaurants. On the ground ﬂoor, the station provides facilities for in-town
check-in for ﬂights. Outside the station, a public transport interchange, a taxi
stand, and two designated pick-up/drop-off areas for vehicles are located at
various points on the ground ﬂoor of the complex. Figure 2 presents a full view
of the ifc complex.3

A PROPOSED ANALYTIC MODEL OF VERTICALITY FOR THE STUDY OF
THE IFC COMPLEX.
Our interest in exploring the vertical semiotics of the ifc complex was
motivated by years of experience interacting with the site personally as
residents of the city. Following the informal observations that we made
individually over the years, we embarked on a nine-month study (July 2015 –
March 2016) which included six intensive site visits with numerous minor
calls to collect data, observe patterns, and record any notable changes or
trends. The site visits involved note-taking, photographic and video
documentation, and unstructured interviews with social actors using the
site. Based on our study of the data collected in the fieldwork, we propose an
analytic model of verticality, illustrated by the ifc complex and organised at
three levels of abstraction as stated below (see Figure 3, from left to right):
• the actual architectural structure, which includes seven infrastructural
components within the ifc complex;
• the physical vertical layout, which consists of four levels of verticality from
the basement to the tower;
• the functional vertical layout, which distinguishes the main activities
carried out within the spaces.
Our analytic model theorises vertical space as a highly stratified and
hierarchical system, in which the access of social actors to different vertical
levels is unequal and power-invested. As such, the degree of vertical mobility of
social actors within a site indexes their (lack of) right to access and use space, as
well as physical and semiotic resources, for particular social practices. While the
tripartite model presented is based on the study of the ifc complex, its
conceptualisation from the local, micro material plane on the left to the
global, macro physical and functional planes on the right allows one to move
from token instantiation to type generalisation. The model can thus be used to
account for structures and sites of varying degrees of complexity where the
vertical landscape is a subject of interest. A bungalow, for example, typically
occupies only the ground level as a private living space. Atraditional shop-house
found in many parts of Southern China and Southeast Asia uses the ground as a
public space for commercial purposes and the two to four upper floors at the
tower level for private residential functions. In big cities in Japan, underground
shopping streets form an extensive network at the basement level, allowing
commercial activities to be conducted in a weatherproof environment while
facilitating commutes on foot at the same time. These different architectural,
physical and functional vertical configurations all have important implications
for the forms and functions of resources used in the linguistic and semiotic
landscapes. Our function-oriented approach thus highlights the need to
conceptualise verticality as physical functional segments, rather than simply
in raw vertical distance, to better understand how space turns into place, and the
role of the discursive and material landscapes in such transformation.
In the following analysis, we explore the relationship between the experience
of verticality and the distribution of social actors and social practices involved.
We relate this, in turn, to the form and function of the semiotic resources and
material facilities employed, as well as the degree of access to the space. Our
analysis does not seek to provide an exhaustive inventory of all the signs found
account for structures and sites of varying degrees of complexity where the
vertical landscape is a subject of interest. A bungalow, for example, typically
occupies only the ground level as a private living space. A traditional shop-house
found in many parts of Southern China and Southeast Asia uses the ground as a
public space for commercial purposes and the two to four upper ﬂoors at the
tower level for private residential functions. In big cities in Japan, underground
shopping streets form an extensive network at the basement level, allowing
commercial activities to be conducted in a weatherproof environment while
facilitating commutes on foot at the same time. These different architectural,
physical and functional vertical conﬁgurations all have important implications
for the forms and functions of resources used in the linguistic and semiotic
landscapes. Our function-oriented approach thus highlights the need to
conceptualise verticality as physical functional segments, rather than simply
in raw vertical distance, to better understand how space turns into place, and the
role of the discursive and material landscapes in such transformation.

In the following analysis, we explore the relationship between the experience
of verticality and the distribution of social actors and social practices involved.
We relate this, in turn, to the form and function of the semiotic resources and
material facilities employed, as well as the degree of access to the space. Our
analysis does not seek to provide an exhaustive inventory of all the signs found
at the site, as any such attempt to completely exhaust a place in constant
interaction with social actors in motion is futile if not impossible, particularly
when the arbitrary nature of sign counting (Spolsky 2009) and the mobility
and capriciousness of signs (Sebba 2010) are taken into account. Instead, we
limit our focus mainly to the key patterns of signs erected by the most powerful
stakeholder(s) in the space concerned, often its owner or management
company. Given the focus of the present study on the theorisation of spatial
verticality, using a more qualitative approach, supplemented by quantitative
findings of more clearly definable signs, is considered more appropriate. We
take space, rather than sign, as the main analytic unit, and organise our
analysis into four sub-sections according to the physical vertical layout as
presented in Figure 3. To illustrate, we use signs representative of the semiotic
patterns discussed to highlight the characteristics of the architectural
structure, vertical physical level and functional space concerned.
EXPLORING THE VERTICALITY OF THE IFC COMPLEX.
The basement levels.
The six-level basement consists of two infrastructural components: the car
parks and Hong Kong Station, which are both owned and managed by the
railway company. It is predominantly a commuting space for private car
owners and railway users to travel to and from other locations, resulting in
massive traffic flow of both vehicles and passengers. As such, signs providing
information are prevalent at the basement levels, mainly for giving directions
to a number of internal and external sites. Figure 4 shows a typical informing
sign in this commuting space, representing hundreds of other signs showing
similar semiotic patterns.
Representing the voice and corporate identity of the railway company, such
informing signs with a standardised visual design are not only found in this
station but also horizontally across all metro stations in the city. Instantly
recognisable as property of the metro operator, these signs are characterised by
the consistent use of a combination of semiotic resources maximising
readability to highlight the ideational meaning (cf. Jaworski and Yeung
2010), i.e. the propositional content of the message. Upper case in coloured
boxes highlights the type of information displayed (EXIT), and distinguishes the
sign from other similar signs specifying the same type of information inside the
station (EXIT E). Large and clear white fonts are shown against a highly
contrastive black background on a durable but economical plastic surface to
display textual information indicating, in both Chinese (國際金融中心一期)
and English (One ifc), the major site(s) nearest the exit concerned. Thick white
arrows point at speciﬁc directions to index places exophorically (Scollon and
Scollon 2003). Together, these semiotic choices of colour, formatting, size and
width serve to enhance legibility, allowing commuters to locate sites of interest
and exits easily and quickly by referring to the set of signs with the same visual
and textual styles within the station.

Such design features of a large number of informing signs, combined with
numerous access facilities in the material landscape such as lifts, escalators
and automatic doors, reﬂect that the basement is mainly a commuting space
allowing a very high level of public access and movement, but not for
prolonged stay. In addition, while the signs are bilingual, the relative size
and placement of Chinese and English on the signs suggest a stronger
emphasis on the former language, with the use of the traditional Chinese
script at the top in a bigger font, and English at the bottom in a smaller
font. This language arrangement may serve the pragmatic purpose of
facilitating quick reference for most commuters in a predominantly ethnic
Chinese population.

While the basement is primarily a commuting space, the concourse areas
within the station are ﬁlled with small shops, offering commuters the
opportunities to buy or eat quickly without the need to leave the commuting
space. The signs associated with these shops, together with the hundreds of
advertising posters lining the station walls, are primarily promotional or
commercial. Like the informing signs, such shop signs give precedence to
Chinese by positioning the Chinese shop name before or on top of its English
equivalent (Figure 5), though the orthographic differences in Chinese
characters and English letters sometimes mean that one language may
occupy more space for the same name even if a similar font size is adopted for
both languages. These promotional signs will be compared with those in the ifc
mall in the ensuing discussion of the podium levels.
The ground level.
The ground ﬂoor of the ifc complex houses a public transport interchange for
buses and minibuses, a taxi stand, and two designated pick-up/drop-off areas
for vehicles. It also provides entrances to the car parks and Hong Kong Station,
with in-town check-in facilities for air passengers. Similar to the basement, the
ground is principally a commuting space. It is, however, more geared towards
public and private vehicles than individual commuters. Of the four vertical
levels at the ifc site, the ground is the one with the smallest area of enclosed
space. The public transport interchange, for example, is covered but not
enclosed. The taxi stand and the pick-up/drop-off areas are largely unsheltered.
This level is therefore the most susceptible to weather conditions such as
extreme temperatures, rain and typhoons. Here, an average commuter’s
experience is likely to be even more transient than in the basement.
While traditionally the street level is a pedestrian realm, this is not the case for
the ifc complex. In the material landscape, pedestrian access to other streets,
through pavements and pedestrian crossings, is limited, leaving the ground
almost exclusively for vehicular use (cf. Xue, Zhai and Roberts 2010). In the
discursive landscape, signs here are mostly informing but the density of signs
giving directions to various places for pedestrians is much lower than that found
in the basement. Instead, there are road signs for drivers and bus route signs for
commuters, in addition to the mobile advertising signage on public vehicles in
motion (cf. Sebba 2010). As the ground level is officially designated as a traffic
interchange, a number of operators and service providers are responsible for
signage, leading to less standardised forms. Figure 6 shows a corner of the public
transport interchange which illustrates this heterogeneity.
Three signs from three different sources are juxtaposed in Figure 6, from left
to right: the ifc mall, the hotel and a minibus company. These signs show
different design features such as font size and style, colour, material texture
and language preference. The leftmost two will be discussed later in relation to
other vertical levels. Of particular interest here is the minibus sign on the right
which shows details of three minibus routes to some of the most expensive
residential areas in the city. In large contrastive dark fonts on an orange
inexpensive plastic surface, the sign emphasises Chinese more than English in
both size and position. As the affluent residents in such upscale areas are not
likely passengers on these minibuses, one might speculate that this choice is
pragmatically motivated by the linguistic background of local workers
commuting there, including security guards, cleaners and handymen. This
preference, however, may also be attributed to the usual language of the sign
producer, i.e. the local minibus company, rather than the sign recipients.
Apart from local workers, our ﬁeldwork shows that another major group
which routinely travels on these minibus routes comprises domestic helpers,
who are mostly from Indonesia or the Philippines. As the two largest non-
Chinese ethnic groups in Hong Kong, each constituting 1.9 percent of the
population (Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department 2011), Indonesians
and Filipinos are mostly employed as domestic helpers in the city, often
receiving only the statutory minimum wage. Despite the fact that the usual
language of many Filipinos in Hong Kong is English and most foreign domestic
helpers are unable to read Chinese, their communicative needs do not seem to
be prioritised by the minibus sign here, or by the many Chinese-oriented public
transport signs placed in this interchange. English seems marginalised here,
perhaps because of the lower economic status of one key group of readers of the
sign. This is in contrast to the emphasis on English at the podium levels, which
is to be discussed in the ensuing sub-section.

The podium levels.
The four-level podium is comprised mainly of the ifc shopping mall, which is
linked to the lower levels of the hotel and serviced apartments. It is a shopping
and dining space, offering a high-end consumer experience to shoppers and
diners. In this respect, the tenants of the mall can be considered among the
most powerful stakeholders of this space. In the podium, signs serving
promotional, or commercial (Scollon and Scollon 2003), functions are
ubiquitous. Unlike the informing signs in the commuting space below which
commonly make use of strategies such as arrows to index directions in the
locality through situated semiotics (Scollon and Scollon 2003), almost all shop
signs in the ifc mall are essentially decontextualised, showing the same brand
names, logos and associated design features regardless of the geographical
location of the shops around the world. Individually, this enhances brand
recognisability and establishes a consistent corporate identity worldwide for
each retailer. Collectively, this creates a horizontal homogenised commercial
discursive landscape in shopping malls all over the globe (cf. Kelly-Holmes
2010). Signs at the podium levels highlight the interpersonal, rather than
ideational, meaning of communication (cf. Jaworski and Yeung 2010),
emphasising the affective aura of the message. This is the case not only for
the promotional shop signs representing global corporates, but also for the less
common informing signs in the podium erected by the local ifc management
company. While smaller in number, such informing signs in the discursive
landscape serve a crucial role in encouraging public access, movement, and
hence footfall, to the mall, by giving directions to both internal and external
sites. Together with such facilities as lifts, escalators, covered pedestrian
walkways and sheltered footbridges in the material landscape, they maximise
both horizontal connection externally with neighbouring buildings and
infrastructures, and vertical connection internally with other levels to the
shopping mall. Compare the hanging sign in Figure 7 with the one serving
similar informing functions in Figure 4 and note how readability gives way to
style in this shopping and dining space.
On the hanging sign in Figure 7, small black fonts, with unconventional
capitalisation, and thin arrows are engraved on a sleek silvery metallic plate to
create a contemporary stylish look. These design features are consistently
employed on all signs put up by the ifc mall management, including the one on
the ground floor in Figure 6, to portray and reflect the luxurious image of this
shopping and dining space. The English top–Chinese bottom (Figure 6, bottom
left) or English first–Chinese next (Figure 7) order on all these signs reflects a
greater emphasis on English, which is consistent with the stronger presence of
English on shop signs here, when compared with those in the shops and
restaurants in the basement metro station. Indeed, monolingual non-Chinese
shop signs, mostly in English and other Western European languages using the
Roman alphabet such as French and Italian, are the norm rather than the
exception in the shopping mall, not only for the global brands but also the local
retailers (Figure 8). Table 1 shows this marked contrast in language
preference on shop signs at these two vertical levels.
As a high-end shopping arcade repeatedly achieving record-high rental rates
in the central business district, the ifc mall is filled with jewellers, watch
retailers, luxury fashion and cosmetics brands, with a total sales figure of over
US$1.2 billion in a year (South China Morning Post 2013). It can be assumed
that the prominence given to English and other European languages on
signage appeals to the target customers of the ifc mall, who belong to the highincome
middle class or above. In contrast, the tenant mix of the metro
shopping area downstairs consists mostly of fast-food restaurants, convenience
stores and bakeries, which involve small transactions. Chinese thus appears to
be more preferred in the station frequented by the less affluent commuters. The
two languages, therefore, seem hierarchically structured, with English having
a higher market value than Chinese at the podium. It should, however, be
noted that this language preference does not only serve the pragmatic purpose
of better communicating with expatriate customers who only speak English or
other Western European languages. Indeed, mainland Chinese tourists
generate 30 percent of sales in the mall (Gu 2013). English thus also has a
symbolic value here – as a marker of prestige, quality and sophistication, in
addition to its connotation of ‘a global commercial culture’ worldwide
(Blommaert and Maly 2014: 202).
The tower levels.
The architectural structural components concerned here are the two
residential towers of the hotel and serviced apartments, which constitute
mainly the living space, and the two commercial towers of One ifc and Two ifc,
which constitute mainly the working space. At the tower levels, public access
is considerably much more restricted than the ﬂoors below, though the means
of access control varies in relation to the type of space involved.

At the 5-star hotel and serviced apartments, access by guests from the
podium entrance to the guest rooms on the 9th to 45th ﬂoors is subtly
facilitated and achieved discursively through the use of informing signs, and
materially through the use of key-cards in the lifts, without the presence of
physical barriers or manned gates. Figure 9 shows an informing sign placed
beside a lift, which illustrates the pattern of signs erected by the hotel
management.

Similar in design to the informing signs at the ifc mall, the signs at the hotel
also highlight the interpersonal dimension of communication: small white
fonts are engraved on a dark metallic plate to create a luxurious yet non-
intrusive ambience. The difference is that many informing signs at this luxury
accommodation are in English only, and more conventional capitalisation is
used. Again, English seems to play a more symbolic than pragmatic role here,
as most of the guests are actually mainland Chinese (Leaders Magazine 2015).
Further, the English-only signs here may serve a gatekeeping function by
keeping out social actors whose linguistic competence is incompatible with the
space. By contrast, the informing sign indicating the staff entrance of the hotel
on the ground ﬂoor is bilingual with Chinese at the top (Figure 6, bottom
right) and emphasises ideational meaning through its more basic overall
design. This is a case where the deployment of semiotic resources by the same
authority varies vertically depending on readership, with the ground-ﬂoor staff
entrance contrasting with the podium guest entrance.

For the ofﬁce towers, access of the white-collar workers to One ifc and Two
ifc is facilitated and achieved rather differently from that in the living space.
For authorised entry, multiple access points are provided at the basement,
ground and podium levels via lifts to the ofﬁce towers, making it possible to
bypass the intermediate levels to access the towers directly from the basement.
At the same time, regulatory signs erected by the management companies of
the ofﬁce towers abound at the boundaries, not only to speciﬁcally prohibit
unauthorised parties from trespassing and loitering, but also to strictly forbid
photography and ﬁlming. Indeed, the difﬁculties we have experienced as
researchers in studying the tower level are testimony to its scrutinised nature,
and more importantly, the exclusivity of access to these higher levels at the
site. Our repeated attempts to access the ofﬁce towers for research purposes
were denied. On many occasions, we were questioned and prohibited from
taking photographs or videos from outside the gated areas of the ofﬁce towers
by security guards. Even our endeavours to approach an automatic teller
machine and company directories placed outside the gated areas during the
non-ofﬁce hours were met with surveillance and refusal. It was only when our
role as social actors changed to potential property buyers that we were able to
have a glimpse of an apartment showroom inside an ofﬁce tower, accessible
only by a lift servicing a restricted number of levels, while being fully escorted
by the property agent at all times. Figure 10 shows an entrance to the One ifc
ofﬁce tower.
The sign placed by the entrance in Figure 10 is representative of signs at the
entrances to the ofﬁce towers in terms of language preference. English is the
slightly more prominent language, through its consistent placement on top of
or before Chinese. The stronger role of English on signs in the two ofﬁce towers
can also be seen in the company directories, as the company names are
arranged alphabetically in English and all company names are shown in
English but not always in Chinese. Table 2 summarises the language choice of
company names on the directories of the ofﬁce towers.
While English may be favoured on the company directories symbolically for
its high economic value and pragmatically for the highly-educated
international office workers, an increasing number of tenants of the office
towers are in fact financial institutions from mainland China. Indeed, mainland
corporates accounted for one-fifth of the Grade A office floor space leased in the
central business district where the ifc is located (Jones Lang LaSalle 2016).
Accordingly, the office towers see the rising presence of Mandarin-speaking
financial professionals, as ‘Mandarin is fast becoming the de facto language in
Hong Kong’s financial services industry’ and native mandarin-speaking
mainlanders are recruited at the expense of Cantonese-speaking locals
(Mortlock 2016). Despite the growth in mainland Chinese tenants and
employees at the office towers, traditional Chinese rather than simplified
Chinese is still used on all the main signs erected by the tower management.
In relation to the texture of signs, the working space makes use of noticeably
less expensive material for its signs (Figure 10) when compared with the living
space. Through their simpler design, the signs at the working space pay more
attention to the ideational meaning of the message, i.e. to prohibit certain
behaviours and to maintain a high level of security for the tenants, most of
which are major global financial institutions. Apart from the use of regulatory
signs in the discursive landscape to control access, a number of facilities in the
material landscape are also employed. These include CCTV cameras, physical
barriers and manned gates allowing access only through smart cards,
registration desks for visitors, dedicated lifts for different floor zones for
limited access and for creating additional gateways, as well as a facial
recognition system for access and lift operating control in non-office hours
(Wong and Lam 2005). Vertical segregation demarcating the working space
from the rest is thus explicit and highly visible both discursively and materially.
This is in marked contrast to what is observed earlier in the living space, where
access is controlled also through signs and facilities, albeit via subtler means.
In both cases, careful arrangements are made to ensure that the working and
living spaces, which are the most difficult to access practically owing to their
distance to the ground, are conveniently linked to the lower floors but remain
insulated and undisturbed by the public access downstairs.
<Conclusion>
DISCUSSION.
As a prime example of MILU projects in Hong Kong, the ifc complex illustrates
the interaction between the discursive and material landscapes, and the
intricate interrelations among social actors, practices, types of space, levels of
access and forms and functions of semiotic resources, all within one single site
of varying levels of verticality. The site thus reveals a highly stratified and
hierarchical vertical system, and the realisation of such stratification is
linguistic, cultural and social-economical.
Linguistically, stronger emphasis on Chinese is found on the signs at the
basement and ground levels, while English is more prominent at the podium
and tower levels. This, however, does not map simplistically onto a Chinese-
English cultural dichotomy in relation to the social actors interacting with the
spaces. Instead, we observe the use of the Chinese-oriented lower levels by
Filipino and Indonesian domestic helpers among others, while the Englishoriented
higher levels are increasingly occupied by well-to-do mainland
Chinese. As such, the linguistic and cultural stratification are in close
connection with the socio-economic stratification, reflecting a society full of
inequalities, influenced by the major driving forces of globalisation,
consumerism and the more local process of mainlandisation. The lower
levels are for commuting mainly by the less affluent communities. By contrast,
the higher levels are elite spaces for shopping, living or working for the
wealthier communities. The semiotic choices including language, therefore,
appear to be motivated pragmatically downstairs and emblematically upstairs. At
the lower levels where traffic and movement of a large number of social actors
is involved, Chinese is prioritised pragmatically as the usual language of most
of the population. As the more efficient language here to locate and to inform
(cf. Cook 2015), its practical value is higher. Signs at these levels are more
rudimentary in design, highlighting the ideational meanings and reflecting the
socio-economic background of their recipients, who are more likely to be from
the middle class or below. At the higher levels where an image of prestige,
quality and luxury is the prime concern, English is prioritised emblematically
as the global lingua franca symbolising consumerism and internationalisation.
As the more appealing language to promote and attract, its market value is
higher here. Signs at these levels are more elaborate in design, focusing more
on the interpersonal meanings and reflecting the income level of their
recipients, who are more likely to be from the most privileged social class of the
city and beyond. It is thus evident that language use is hierarchical in the
vertical model. However, such hierarchical ordering is not absolute but is
sensitive to the social function and value of the language in that particular
vertical space, in close relation to the cultural and socio-economic background
of the social actors interacting with the space.
An important implication arising from such multi-layer stratification is the
simultaneous social segregation realised vertically at the site through the
different degrees of mobility and access of social actors. Only the most
privileged and powerful groups, mostly highly-educated and/or high-income
financial professionals and hotel residents, are able to move freely across all
vertical levels of the site to access and consume the associated physical and
semiotic resources and to benefit from the full functionality of the spaces. They
are at the top of the social hierarchy pyramid, smallest in number but enjoying
the highest level of mobility, access, privacy and security, while gazing down
and surveying the general population from height. The majority, including us
as researchers, are excluded from the gated communities of the towers and can
only raise our gaze to conjecture the inaccessible heights of the powerful.
Of course, height has long been a symbol of power and status in many
cultures, as realised metaphysically in the idea of a three-layered universe
consisting of the heavens, earth, and the underworld. Gods inhabit the
heavens and the mountain tops, to which ordinary mortals must raise their
gaze. Similarly, imposing structures such as the Acropolis, the Great Pyramid
of Giza or the great medieval cathedrals of Europe have all symbolised power
through height materially. However, the association between height and
prestige, almost always taken for granted as universal (see, for example,
Graham 2016), is indexical rather than iconic and must be understood in
relation to the segmented nature of verticality, the function of the space
involved, as well as the geographical location, i.e. the horizontal dimension, of
the space. In many European cities, it is the low-rise detached dwellings in
affluent suburbs that are considered more prestigious, while the high-rise
tower blocks in less privileged neighbourhoods are often used as council
housing. Similarly, in an ancient colosseum or a modern theatre, it is the seats
in the front rows closest to the stage that are for the most important people or
the costliest, whereas the higher levels further away from the stage provide
seats to social groups of lower status or which are cheaper in price. In the case
of the ifc complex, upper floors in the office towers generally command higher
rents because of better views. In the podium shopping mall, however, it is the
lower floors, or the floors closest to the ground, which are with most footfall
and hence most expensive to rent. In other words, the indexical value of
elevation is relative to each volumetric space rather than absolute. Height has
no iconic universal meaning in itself. This demonstrates the polycentric nature
of space (Blommaert 2007) and again highlights the value of taking a
functional approach to verticality in the analytic model.
A further point which needs to be considered in relation to the social
segregation discussed above is the omnipresence of movement and flow, and
the multiple and changing roles of social actors. While spaces are stratified,
they are also interconnected, not only vertically but also horizontally. As noted
earlier in the podium level analysis, horizontal external connection of the
shopping mall with neighbouring buildings and infrastructures is achieved and
maximised through informing signs and covered walkways and footbridges,
which offer shelter from heat and storm. These resources in the discursive and
material landscapes together aim to attract commuters, pedestrians, officeworkers
and hotel guests to the weatherproof mall and to transform them into
potential consumers. Moving from one space to another thus often involves
role-changing. Importantly, social actors interact with the discursive and
material landscapes in such spaces at different times of the day, week or year
and/or in different languages with different goals and intentions, making the
spaces active, dormant or hectic. Some such encounters, as in the working and
living spaces, are more permanent, while some others, as in the commuting
and shopping and dining spaces, are more transient. A commuter travelling at
rush hour in the basement on typical weekdays, for instance, may be an
employee working at an investment bank in the office tower upstairs during
working hours, and occasionally go to a bar in the podium as a consumer after
work. One’s linguistic repertoire and communicative strategies thus need to
adapt to interact with the corresponding space. As such, the resources used in
the discursive and material landscapes at different vertical levels, signs
included, not only vary in terms of their key target recipients but also their
regular peak times of use in a day, week and/or year. While beyond the scope
of the present study, this is an area which merits further research, calling for a
much finer, richer and more socially-oriented approach than any quantitative
studies of signs would allow.
CONCLUSIONS.
Rather than living in an idealised flat world where an equal playing field is
created for every individual, we increasingly and perhaps regrettably find
ourselves in a world that is vertically stratified as a result of urbanisation. In
the present case, such stratification is realised linguistically, culturally and
social-economically. Through a case study of the vertical semiotics of an
iconic skyscraper, this article has demonstrated how verticality, as a much
ignored dimension in landscape-related research, can enrich our
understanding of the intricate interplay between the discursive and material
landscapes, while addressing such key issues surrounding social actors,
practices, levels of access and functions of space in the process. Offering a
novel and crucial dimension for landscape-related research in the increasingly
vertical contemporary society, our analytic model has shown the power of
incorporating the notion of vertical landscape into the current research
paradigm, not simply as a contextual background but as ‘an agentive force in
sociolinguistic processes’ (Blommaert 2007). Placing verticality at the centre
stage but also exploring its relationship with horizontality, our study
underlines the explanatory value of the tripartite analytic model in
dissecting and segmenting vertical space functionally in relation to social
actors, practices and access, instead of simply measuring and examining
height in metres or floors. It also suggests the potential of applying the model
to the study of other sites with different configurations of verticality, allowing
comparison and generalisation to be made at the material, physical and
functional levels, in order to identify key patterns of association between
different physical vertical levels and their major functions, and the ways in
which the material and discursive landscapes constitute and are constituted
by the space concerned. This opens up a new research agenda, providing a
three-dimensional perspective which may lead to a redefinition of the very
notion of landscape in sociolinguistic research.
