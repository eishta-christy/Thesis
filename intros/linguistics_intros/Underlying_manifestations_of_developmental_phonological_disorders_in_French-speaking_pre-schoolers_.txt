This study examined the psycholinguistic proﬁles of Quebec French-
speaking children with developmental phonological disorders (DPD).
The purpose was to determine whether the endophenotypes that have
been identiﬁed in English-speaking children with DPD are similarly
associated with speech impairment
in French-speaking children.
Seventy-two children with DPD and ten children with normally
developing speech, aged four to six years, received a comprehensive
assessment battery that included measures at the phenotype level (i.e.
measures of overt speech production skills) and endophenotype level
(i.e. measures of potential underlying core deﬁcits

phonological processing or oral motor impairments). The majority of
the children with DPD presented with a psycholinguistic proﬁle
indicative of diﬃculties with phonological processing. Phonological
processing skills also explained unique variance in speech production
accuracy, indicating that French-speaking children with DPD, who
produce diﬀerent surface speech errors than English-speaking children
with DPD, are nonetheless very similar with regards
to their
underlying psycholinguistic proﬁle.

The remediation of misarticulations in children’s speech has been a core part
of speech-language pathology practice since the earliest days of
the
profession (Van Riper,  []), and the treatment of unintelligible
speech remains a prominent function of the speech-language pathologist
(Schooling, ). However, treatment approaches are more eﬃcient now

In terms of distal causes, environmental risk and protective factors interact
with the genotype, to produce varying trajectories of speech development.
The heritability of speech disorders is now well established (Lewis et al.,
), and some speciﬁc genetic causes have been identiﬁed. For example,
polymorphisms in the FOXP gene are associated with apraxia of speech,
a motor speech disorder characterized by poor voluntary control of speech
movements. However, these polymorphisms and apraxia of speech as a
subtype of speech disorder are both rare. More commonly, speech
diﬃculties in children are phonological in nature and the underlying distal
cause conforms to the common disease / common variant model described
by Bishop (). Accordingly, the etiology is multifactorial, involving
interactions among many genetic and environmental factors that combine
to explain the full range of variance in speech intelligibility. The large
number of genes involved, each having small eﬀects, accounts for the
heterogeneity observed within the general population and within
diagnostic subgroups. Therefore, advances in our understanding of the

More promising as a guide to individualizing treatment approaches is an

These proximal

endophenotype – the network of structural mechanisms and neurolinguistic
processes responsible for speech development. As a core feature of the
disorder, the processes that are associated with the child’s speech deﬁcit
should be measurable even as the child matures or when there are changes
in the environment. In other words, stability in the endophenotype is
expected even as the phenotype is changing with development and
environmental inputs such as speech therapy. Oral motor functioning and
phonological processing will be considered here as possible proximal
causes of a primary developmental speech sound disorder.

concept of

Several approaches to speech therapy are based on the view that
unintelligible or misarticulated speech is caused by diﬃculties with speech
motor control (Lof & Watson, ) especially when the child’s speech
contains inconsistent speech errors or distortion errors (Betz & Stoel-
Gammon, ; Broomﬁeld & Dodd, ; Forrest, ). However,
motor speech disorders are actually very rare, perhaps –% of
the
population of children with primary developmental speech impairments
(e.g. Bradford & Dodd, ; Shriberg, ). Some children with speech
errors demonstrate signiﬁcant diﬃculties with strength, rate, or patterns of
articulator movement when assessed with appropriate
technologies
(Gibbon, ; Goozée, Murdoch, Ozanne, Cheng, Hill & Gibbon, ).
However, these diﬃculties cannot be discerned from the characteristics of
the children’s speech errors, as is sometimes assumed as in the case of so-
called phonetic disorder, i.e. distortion errors are thought to be motoric in
nature but
are often associated with cognitive-linguistic
endophenotypes and may not be associated with underlying phonetic
instability (Preston & Edwards, ; Preston & Koenig, ). Therefore,

Although research at the endophenotype level leads to a sense of consensus
(the majority of children with a speech sound disorder have diﬃculties with
phonological processing),
from the endophenotype to the
phenotype level of description are not straightforward. As previously
mentioned,
the clinical presentation of children with speech sound
disorders is heterogeneous, and various schemas have been proposed to
group the population into subtypes based on proﬁles of speech errors. In
particular, Dodd () has proposed that distortion errors, inconsistent
errors, typical phonological process errors, and atypical error patterns
diﬀerentiate subtypes that also map onto discrete proximal causes. In
particular, children with atypical patterns of phonological error were
expected to have a family history of speech errors and underlying
diﬃculties with phonological processing, but in fact these characteristics
were found to be commonly occurring among samples of English-speaking
children with a speech sound disorder, regardless of their patterns of speech
errors. Rather, the error type proﬁles identiﬁed by Dodd may reﬂect
developmental and severity gradients rather than qualitative diﬀerences
between subgroups of children (Rvachew & Brosseau-Lapré, ).

Heterogeneity in the pattern of speech errors produced by children with
speech sound disorders might also reﬂect environmental factors rather than
diﬀerences in the underlying phenotype. This can be seen by comparing
the speech errors produced by children learning diﬀerent
languages.
Recently, we compared the types of speech sound errors produced by
twenty-four Quebec French-speaking children to those produced by
twenty-four Canadian English-speaking children, with both groups
recruited from speech therapy caseloads (Brosseau-Lapré & Rvachew,
). The groups were carefully matched for age
and receptive
vocabulary skills; furthermore, they were matched for percent consonants
correct in their spontaneous speech to ensure equivalent severity of the
speech impairment across the two groups. One might expect similarity in
the kinds of error patterns observed because the consonant inventory is
largely overlapping in French and English /p, b, t, d, k, ɡ, m, n, f, v, s, z,
ʃ, ʒ, l, w, j/; for a description of the French phonological system we refer

to French (/ɲ, ʁ, ɥ/), and several English segments are absent from the
French inventory (/ɹ, tʃ, dʒ, θ, ð, h/; /ŋ/ being absent except in a few
instances such as /kãpiŋkaʁ/), it is possible to describe error patterns in
both languages according to phonological processes (Bishop & Minor-
Corriveau, ) or delinking features (Bérubé, Bernhardt & Stemberger,
) that are common to both languages.

striking
diﬀerences in the frequencies of occurrence for consonants (Crystal, )
and syllables shapes (Adda-Decker, Boula de Mareüil, Adda & Lamel,
) must be considered. In particular, the core syllable shape in French
is a simple CV, in comparison to English which uses proportionally more
closed syllables (Stokes, Kern & Dos Santos, ). Another important
diﬀerence between these two languages is the absence of lexical stress in
French, which organizes prosody around the phrase as the accentual unit.
In conversational French, stress placement falls on the last full syllable of
a group, such as the utterance or a syntactic or semantic phrase, with a
counter-accent on the ﬁrst syllable of
the group (Di Cristo, ).
Therefore, the last syllable of an isolated word would be stressed, as in
jambon ‘ham’ [ˌʒãˈbɔ̃]; when the word is placed in a phrase such as le
jambon chaud ‘the hot ham’ [ˌlə ʒãbɔ̃
ˈʃo], no syllables in the word are
stressed as the accent and counter-accent shift to the edges of the phrase.
Brosseau-Lapré and Rvachew () concluded that these diﬀerences in
prosody combined with the longer word lengths in French compared to
English accounted for a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the patterns of speech
error that we observed between groups of children with speech sound
speaking these two languages. Speciﬁcally, French-speaking

produced more errors involving segments, while leaving the syllable
structure of the word intact. Other ﬁndings are consistent with this
conclusion, such as the very early age of consonant mastery observed for
Quebec French-speaking children by MacLeod, Sutton, Trudeau, and
Thordardottir (). Diﬀering patterns of cluster errors by Quebec
French-speaking children, relative to Canadian English-speaking children,
also appear to reﬂect these trade-oﬀs between word shape and prosody
between the two languages (Rvachew & Brosseau-Lapré, ; Rvachew,
Leroux & Brosseau-Lapré, ).

DEVELOPMENTAL PHONOLOGICAL DISORDER (DPD), for the remainder of this

concomitant impact on the intelligibility of the child’s speech.

The primary hypothesis is that these Quebec French-speaking children
with DPD will present with an endophenotypic proﬁle consistent with
that observed in English-speaking children with a primary developmental
speech sound disorder: speciﬁcally, most of the children are expected to
have diﬃculties with phonological processing, and only a very small
proportion of children are expected to present with a motor speech
disorder. A secondary hypothesis is that articulation accuracy will be
predicted by vocabulary and phonological processing skills, with oral-
motor function not explaining speech deﬁcits in Quebec French-speaking
children. Conﬁrmation of a similar endophenotype for speech sound
disorder cross-linguistically, despite diﬀerences in the phenotypic proﬁle,
will have theoretical and clinical implications for our understanding of this
commonly occurring developmental disorder.

exposure through playmates. The total number of hours of exposure to
each language during a child’s typical week was calculated. One to six
weeks later, the children were seen for a second assessment visit lasting
– minutes, during which time a language sample was collected and
measures of
repetition skills were
administered. The selection criteria were: native and dominant speaker of
French (at least % exposure to French as reported by the parents); age
; to ; on the ﬁrst planned day of intervention; primary diagnosis of
DPD; hearing within normal limits as documented before referral to the
study; and standard score of at
least  on measures of receptive
vocabulary and non-verbal intelligence. Children were excluded from the
study if their DPD was secondary to other conditions, such as sensory-
neural hearing loss, cerebral palsy, cleft palate, global developmental delay,
or autism spectrum disorder. Concomitant receptive and/or expressive
language impairment and suspected childhood apraxia of speech were not
exclusionary criteria. Two identical twins and two siblings participated in
the study; one child from each pair was removed from certain analyses, as
described below.

Ten typically developing (TD) children also participated in the study and
were assessed at their house by the ﬁrst author. Parents of the TD children
completed the same questionnaires about their child’s development, medical
and family history, and language exposure. In addition, four measures which
will be described below were administered to these children: receptive
vocabulary, phonological awareness, articulation accuracy in single words,
and syllable repetition.

Table  presents descriptive information for

the two groups of
participants. With regards to the children with DPD, there were ﬁfty-two
males and twenty females, a · male:female ratio which is very similar to
the ·: ratio reported for English-speaking children with speech sound
disorders by Shriberg (). In terms of past or current family history of
speech, language, or reading diﬃculties, the data are presented for sixty-
ﬁve of the seventy-two children with DPD, since two children had been
adopted, the parents of three additional children did not complete the
questionnaires, and one member of each sibling pair was randomly
removed from the family history analyses. The parents of ·% of the
children with DPD reported no family history of speech, language, or
reading diﬃculties, compared to % of the TD children. Twenty-one
percent of the children with DPD had one biological and nuclear family
member with a history of current or past speech, language, or reading
diﬃculties, while only one of the TD children reportedly had a nuclear

French is the majority language of the approximately · million residents
of the province of Quebec, Canada. While ·% of the population of Quebec
is monolingual French, only % of the residents of the city of Montreal and
its region do not speak other languages: ·% speak both French and
English, and the most common mother tongues in this city, following
French and English, are Arabic, Spanish, Italian, Creole, and Greek
(Statistics Canada, ). Table  presents the linguistic environments of
the participants.

Procedures
EVIP. The Échelle de Vocabulaire en Images Peabody (Dunn, Theriault-
Whalen & Dunn, ) is a Canadian-French adaptation of the Peabody
Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (Dunn & Dunn, ). The practice and
test items were administered as instructed in the test manual.

K-BIT-. The Matrices subtest of the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test,
nd Edition (Kaufman & Kaufman, ) measures non-verbal intelligence.
Children were presented with color plates with a target picture at the top,
and six pictures at the bottom. They were asked to point to the picture
among the six choices that went with the target. The practice and test items
were administered according to the instructions in the test manual.

TFP. The Test Francophone de Phonologie (Paul & Rvachew, ) is a
test of articulation accuracy that mirrors the phoneme distribution, syllable
shapes, and word length characteristics of Quebec French, as described in
Paul (). In brief, a total of  words are elicited using  full-color
photographs, targeting  consonants and  vowels. Examiners used
carrier phrases to elicit spontaneous productions of the target words; if the
child did not answer, delayed imitation techniques such as asking a choice
question with the target as the ﬁrst choice was used. Immediate imitation
was used as a last resort to ensure datasets that were as complete as
possible for each child. Nonetheless,
three children each refused to
produce one target word, and one child did not produce two target words.
The percentage of consonants correct (PCC) was calculated based on the
number of consonants each child attempted to produce on this test.
Administration of the TFP was video-recorded using a Sony Handycam
HDR-XR or a JVC Everio GZ-MG video camera. The audio ﬁles
were extracted and saved as .wav ﬁles.

OSMSE-. The Oral Speech Mechanism Screening Examination, Third
Edition (St Louis & Ruscello, ) evaluates the structure and function
of the lips, tongue, jaw, teeth, palate, pharynx, velopharyngeal mechanism,
breathing,
and alternate motion rates
(AMRs). The screening tool was administered according to the manual
and was video-recorded. Repetition rates were calculated from waveform
displays of the children’s responses. Many of the children who participated
in this study were younger than ;,
the minimum age to use the
OSMSE- norms. Younger children had more diﬃculty completing the
required number of repetitions ( for single syllables,  for [pata], and 
for [pataka]) but age was not correlated with performance with regard to
repetition rates in syllable/seconds for any of the isolated syllables or
syllable sequences. We therefore calculated the repetitions/second for each
child, and prorated the pass criteria for
the required number of
repetitions. Pass standards were ·, ·, ·, ·, and · repetitions/
second for [pa], [ta], [ka], [pata], and [pataka], respectively, for children
up to the age of  months, and ·, ·, ·, ·, and · for children
aged  to  months.

SRT. The Syllable Repetition Task was administered using a PowerPoint
audio presentation and scored according to the instructions provided by
Shriberg and Lohmeier (). A competence score as well as three speech
processing scores (encoding, memory, and transcoding) can be derived
from the SRT, as described by Shriberg et al. (). The competence
score consists of the number of consonants that were accurately produced
by the child; cognate substitutions on the voiced stops are scored as
correct (i.e. p/b, t/d), and addition errors are not taken into account as
long as the target consonant is produced in the correct position. Encoding
of auditory-perceptual representations is measured by calculating the
percentage of substitution of sounds that belong to the same manner as the
target, which presumably indicates partial knowledge of the target. The
ratios of accurately repeated consonants in longer words compared to
shorter words allow quantifying the contribution of phonological memory
in the speaker’s performance on the SRT. The ratios are transformed
using the formula *( + natural log of the ratio); values above  or
below  are truncated. Finally, the transcoding score is the percentage of
items containing one of more addition errors such as /bɑdɑ/ ? [bɑndɑ],
subtracted from  so that higher scores denote higher competence in
transcoding. Addition errors are considered to reﬂect motor planning and/
or programming deﬁcits.

used. Two research assistants (one graduate student in speech-language
pathology and one undergraduate student in linguistics) independently
transcribed % and % of the TFP samples. The mean transcription

diﬃcult, in particular: elevate the tongue, move tongue along the palate, puﬀ
out the cheeks. Table  shows that ·% of children passed all ﬁve syllable
repetition tasks, which leaves a substantial proportion who had signiﬁcant
diﬃculties with rate, rhythm, and/or accuracy for at least one task. The
proportion of children failing more than three tasks, indicating diﬃculties
with the repetition of both single- and multi-syllable sequences, was small
(·%, or  children in total). Therefore, these data suggest that the
proportion of children with an actual motor speech disorder was small in
this group, as has been reported in other studies describing English-
speaking children with speech impairments.

examined using two strategies: Pearson correlations between measures and
t-tests to examine diﬀerences between children who achieved below or
above average performance on the DDK and AMR measures. The
analyses revealed no relationship between oral-motor performance and any
other measure.

Phonological awareness
As shown in Table , the phonological awareness performance of the DPD
group was signiﬁcantly poorer than that of the TD group with respect to
all four scores derived from the Test de Conscience Phonologique. This
test proved so diﬃcult for the children with DPD that eleven children in
this group did not respond correctly to any test items, whereas some
children in the TD group achieved ceiling-level performance. The rime-
matching subtest proved to be easier than onset matching or segmentation
for both groups of children.

Syllable repetition task
SRT scores are shown in Table  by group and type of score (i.e.
competence, encoding, memory, and transcoding scores). As expected, the
competence scores decreased with word length for children in both
groups, but the TD group achieved high scores at all word lengths. All
TD children obtained scores of % for the -syllable target words,
scores above % for the -syllable target words, and scores above % for
the -syllable target words. We adopted a standard of one standard
deviation below the mean to compare proﬁles of our Quebec French-
speaking

psycholinguistic proﬁles of English-speaking children with speech sound
disorders. Children with DPD scored more than a standard deviation

NOTES: Data obtained from the Oral Speech Mechanism Screening Examination, Third
Edition (St Louis & Ruscello, ). Data is available for  of the  children since we
removed one child from each of the two pairs of siblings; three children refused to
complete the repetition rate tasks; and the video recordings were missing for two additional
children. The data for [pata] only includes  children as this speciﬁc task was not
administered by mistake to eight of the children.

encoding of auditory-perceptual representations, the mean score of the DPD
group was also more than a standard deviation below the mean of the TD
group, consistent with our hypothesis of phonological processing deﬁcits
in this group. As further conﬁrmation, the phonological memory score was
one-and-a-half standard deviations lower for the DPD group compared to
the TD group. In contrast, the transcoding scores of the two groups were
similar and essentially at ceiling,
indicating that children were very
unlikely to make errors indicative of a motor speech disorder. Those few
instances of consonant addition errors did occur within the DPD group,
however: one child added a single consonant to one -syllable word; two
other children each added a consonant to one -syllable word and one
-syllable word; and two other children each added one consonant to one
-syllable word. Two of these children passed both the DDK and AMR
tasks, while one child failed the AMR only, and two children failed both
the DDK and AMR tasks.

SRT outcomes are further represented in Figure , which shows the
proportion of the DPD group children who obtained an SRT encoding or
memory score that is more than one standard deviation below the mean of
the ten TD children. Eleven children (% of the  children for whom
we have SRT data) passed all three speech processing tasks on the test.

made a contribution to articulation accuracy, whereas DDK and AMR did
not contribute to articulation accuracy beyond the contribution of
phonological processing.

Subgroups of children using cluster analysis
Finally, the K-means cluster function of SPSS for Windows was used to
identify clusters within the DPD group on the basis of their articulation
accuracy (PCC), receptive vocabulary (EVIP), and phonological awareness
(TCP) test scores. As shown in Figure , the resulting clusters were as
follows: Cluster  ( children; %) had the lowest PCC values along with
low EVIP and TCP scores. Cluster  ( children, %) obtained much
higher PCC scores but low EVIP and TCP scores. Cluster  ( children,

Previously we have demonstrated that Quebec French-speaking preschool-
age children with DPD diﬀer signiﬁcantly from their English-speaking
peers with respect to their phenotypic proﬁle: in other words, these two
groups of children present with noticeably diﬀerent proﬁles of speech
errors, such that Quebec French-speaking children produce more syllable
structure errors and English-speaking children produce more segment level
errors. We concluded that these diﬀerences in speech characteristics for
children who are struggling to acquire the phonological system of their
language reﬂect diﬀerences in the language input from the environment.
Here we hypothesized that the Quebec French-speaking children with
DPD would nonetheless present similarly to English-speaking children at
the endophenotypic level. More speciﬁcally we expected this sample of
seventy-two Quebec French-speaking children to have signiﬁcant diﬃculty
with tests of phonological processing relative to their age peers with
normally developing speech accuracy. We further expected that their
diﬃculties with the acquisition of age-appropriate speech accuracy would
not be explained by oral motor deﬁcits. These hypotheses, derived from
many studies on English-speaking children with speech impairments (e.g.
Rvachew & Grawburg, ), were fully conﬁrmed.

As we expected, very few children showed diﬃculties with motor planning
and/or programming as evidenced by their ability to repeat single syllables
and syllable sequences rapidly. Although most children failed at least one
syllable repetition task, only ·% failed both single- and multi-syllable
repetition tasks, providing a clear indication of a motor speech disorder.
Furthermore, only ﬁve children obtained a low transcoding score on the
SRT due to the production of addition errors that are characteristic of
childhood apraxia of speech: of these ﬁve children, three failed transcoding
and phonological memory; one child failed transcoding, phonological
memory, and encoding; and one child failed transcoding only. As found in
other studies, most children in our study who did present with motor
speech diﬃculties also had deﬁcits in other endophenotypes related to
phonological processing skills,
language skills, and literacy skills (e.g.
Lewis, Freebairn, Hansen, Iyengar & Taylor, ; Shriberg et al., ).
In contrast, the majority of children obtained signiﬁcantly low encoding and
memory scores on the SRT, indexing deﬁcits in multiple areas of phonological
processing. These phonological processing deﬁcits were further conﬁrmed by
marked diﬃculties on all subtests of the phonological awareness test by
virtually all of the children in the DPD group. Furthermore, phonological
awareness, encoding, and memorial processes explained signiﬁcant unique
variance in speech production accuracy even after controlling for individual
diﬀerences in receptive language and maternal education.

Ramus, Marshall, Rosen, and van der Lely () recently attempted to
explain the partial (incomplete) overlap of speciﬁc language impairment
with developmental dyslexia in a study in which three factors were found

Some of our participants with DPD had poor articulation accuracy but
relatively good phonological awareness, while some children had milder
diﬃculties with articulation accuracy but poorer phonological awareness, as
previously described for English-speaking children with DPD (e.g.
Hesketh, ; Rvachew, Chiang & Evans, ). Examination of these
variations in proﬁle between children can be helpful in illuminating the
interactions that explain individual outcomes. Three clusters of children
with DPD were found in our sample, with diﬀerent strengths and
weaknesses with regard to phonological processing skills,
receptive
vocabulary, and articulation accuracy. The children in Cluster  who had
diﬃculties across all domains would likely need relatively intense speech
therapy directed at improvement of speech accuracy, combined with speciﬁc
eﬀorts to intensify environmental inputs to support language and emergent
literacy growth, using, for example, a ‘response to intervention approach’
and an enriched preschool environment (e.g. Wilcox, Gray, Guimond &
Laﬀerty, ). The children in Cluster  who presented with similarly low
receptive vocabulary and PA scores, but on average achieved higher PCC
values, might respond well to the comprehensive but somewhat less intense
input-oriented approach to intervention described in Rvachew and
Brosseau-Lapré (). The third cluster of children presented with
relatively good albeit delayed articulation accuracy with above-average
receptive vocabulary skills; these children would likely respond well to a
stand-alone phonology therapy targeting their speciﬁc error patterns. The
outlier in this cluster obtained a PCC value below  despite exceptional
vocabulary knowledge and average phonological awareness skills; closer
inspection of the data for this child revealed that his non-verbal intelligence
was in the higher average range and that his well-educated parents reported
a high frequency of literacy activities such as reading books and going to the

library. Language input provided to the child is the most
important
environmental inﬂuence in terms of language development (Hart & Risley,
). Strong vocabulary scores,
combined with strong non-verbal
intelligence and rich language input likely allowed this child to attain good
phonological awareness despite the challenges associated with his severe DPD.

Cross-linguistic diﬀerences
Despite the ﬁnding that Quebec French- and Canadian English-speaking
children with DPD are similar at the level of the endophenotype, there
was an interesting diﬀerence in our sample’s performance when repeating
the -syllable target words of the SRT relative to the published literature
for English-speaking children. Few Quebec French-speaking children with
DPD (%) obtained a score of % or less for the CVCV words, compared
to % of the participants in Shriberg, Lohmeier, Campbell, Dollaghan,
Green, and Moore (). One possible explanation for this diﬀerence is
the age of the participants, as the Quebec French-speaking children were
four to six years old, whereas the English-speaking children were three to
ﬁve years old. Additionally, it is possible that French-speaking children
with DPD repeat CVCV targets more accurately than English-speaking
children, since French words tend to be longer than words in English
(MacLeod et al., ). A similar ﬁnding was found by Dispaldro,
Leonard, and Deevy () in Italian-speaking children with speciﬁc
language impairment or
typical development, using a nonword list
composed of words with phonemes and syllable shapes that are mastered
by young children. Italian words are also longer than English words, with
most words in Italian being three and four syllables long (Mancini &
Voghera, ). Dispaldro et al. () proposed that familiarity with
longer words “might enable Italian-speaking children to gain greater
command of longer linguistic material” (p. ). Further studies are
required to determine whether the performance of children speaking
languages with longer words than English on the -syllable targets of the
SRT might
indicate diﬃculties with encoding of acoustic-perceptual
information, similarly to how English-speaking children perform with the
-syllable words of the SRT.

Limitations
An important limitation of this study was that speech perception was not
measured directly in our participants. Initially we had planned to assess

correctly or incorrectly was piloted. However, we found that this measure
was not a valid test of speech perception abilities for French-speaking
children, given that their speech production error patterns are at the
prosodic level of the phonological hierarchy. Thus, a stronger test of our
hypothesis that the underlying speech process that explains the speech
impairment in these children involves encoding of phonological
input
requires the development of a valid measure of speech perception that is
better adapted to the French language, speciﬁcally involving multi-syllabic
words and the simulation of syllable structure error patterns (e.g. omission
of word-internal coda consonants, misarticulation of consonants
in
unstressed syllables within multi-syllabic words, and spreading of features
within complex onsets).

The total sample of this study is also a limitation because, while reasonably
large at eighty-two children overall, we were unable to model the complex
relationships among all the variables that we assessed. The matching of the
samples was also problematic because the large diﬀerence in receptive
vocabulary skills and the smaller diﬀerence in maternal education may
explain some of the diﬀerence in phonological processing abilities between
the DPD and TD groups. However, during the course of the study we
developed measures of speech accuracy and phonological awareness that
proved to be valid and reliable for French-speaking children, and showed
that the Syllable Repetition Task could be used with this population as
well. Therefore, following modiﬁcation of the speech perception test to
reﬂect our
in
French, these new tools are in place for continued investigation of the
underpinnings of DPD in French and the
linkages between the
phonological processing endophenotype and later literacy outcomes.

improved understanding of phonological development

C O N C L U S I O N
This study represented the ﬁrst description of the speech characteristics of a
large group of Quebec French-speaking children with DPD. The children
presented with a primary underlying deﬁcit in the domain of phonological
processing, as has been reported in many prior studies for English-speaking
children with deﬁcits in speech accuracy and intelligibility. All children who
are referred for a speech-language pathology assessment due to concerns with
speech accuracy must be carefully examined for concomitant deﬁcits in the
language, phonological processing, and literacy domains so that interventions
can be targeted at
the surface characteristics and the psycholinguistic
underpinnings of the child’s communication deﬁcit. The results of the
current study add to a growing literature recommending that interventions
for children with DPD focus on perceptual and phonological knowledge
(e.g. Munson, Baylis, Krause & Yim, ), in addition to speech accuracy.
