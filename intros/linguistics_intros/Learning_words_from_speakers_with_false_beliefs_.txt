Human communication relies on the ability to track beliefs and other
epistemic states, since hearers try to infer the speaker’s intentions during
conversation (Grice, ). The ability to consult epistemic states during
communication has been argued to be present early in life: infants take
into account a speaker’s knowledge when ﬁxing reference for novel
expressions (Baldwin, ; Bloom, ; Koenig & Echols, ), and
exclude as potential referents for novel labels objects that they already have
names for (Diesendruck & Markson, ). Other studies show that
children trust knowledgeable over uninformed speakers when acquiring
novel labels: when a speaker explicitly claimed ignorance about the correct
referent of a novel word (e.g. “I don’t know what a blicket is. Maybe it’s
this one.”), three- and four-year-olds did not learn the word (Sabbagh &
Baldwin, ). In another study, four-year-olds, and in some cases
three-year-olds, preferred to learn a novel label from a previously reliable
speaker than from one who claimed ignorance of the names of familiar
objects or who labeled them incorrectly (Koenig & Harris, ; cf. also
Birch, Vauthier & Bloom, ; Jaswal & Neely, ).
Nevertheless, whether (and how early) preschoolers track their
interlocutors’ mental states is still a matter of debate. For instance, some
commentators have suggested that young children’s ability to match
previously unlabeled referents to novel words does not require the use of
pragmatic reasoning, since this ability is present in autistic populations
who have deficits in social cognition (de Marchena, Eigsti, Worek, Ono &
Snedeker, ; see also Breheny, ). Other work has questioned
whether older children and even adults successfully adopt the perspective
of their interlocutors during referential communication (Epley, Morewedge
& Keysar, ; but see Nadig & Sedivy, ). Moreover, several studies
have shown that five-year-olds have difficulties with pragmatic inferences
that rely on calculations of how informative a speaker should be based on
her knowledge and the conversational needs (Noveck, ; Papafragou &
Musolino, ; Huang & Snedeker, ; among others).
A particularly stringent and straightforward test for preschoolers’ ability
to consult others’ belief states during communication is to ask whether
children can adjust their expectations about the speaker’s referential intent
when learning a word from a speaker with a false belief. False belief
paradigms have been used extensively in the developmental literature to
study sensitivity to others’ epistemic states in non-communicative contexts
(i.e. contexts that involve understanding and predicting someone’s actions;
see Wimmer & Perner, ; Baron-Cohen, Leslie & Frith, ). Several
studies have adopted these paradigms to ask whether young children can
reason about a communicator’s referential intent even in circumstances in
which the communicator holds a false belief – but results have been
somewhat mixed. In the ﬁrst study of this kind, Happé and Loth ()
gave three- to four-year-old children a false belief Word Learning task
(adapted from Baldwin, ). In this task, a puppet called Mary put a
novel object in a box, closed the lid, and left the scene. Another puppet
called Tom entered, removed Mary’s object from the box, and put another
novel object in. Mary returned to the scene, picked up the closed box and
named the contents (“Do you want to see the modi? There’s a modi in
this box! Let’s see the modi!”). Next, children were presented with the
two novel objects and were asked to indicate which one was the modi.
Results indicated that % of the children who had previously succeeded
in control questions passed that task. However, because of the way the
data are reported, the precise ages of the passers and any developmental
diﬀerences between three- and four-year-olds cannot be ascertained from
this study. Furthermore, other studies suggest that preschoolers’ ability to
adjust word learning when the speaker has a false belief may be more
limited: Carpenter, Call, and Tomasello (, Exp. ) gave children
around their third birthday a Word Learning task similar to the one used
by Happé and Loth, except that the original object was removed from its
location and not substituted by another novel object. About % of these
children (after taking into account performance on control trials) passed
the Word Learning task. More recent experiments by Houston-Price and
colleagues () also lead to higher estimates. For instance, in one of
their experiments (Exp. ), that was similar to Happé and Loth’s, only
about % of three-year-olds and % of four-year-olds passed a false
belief Word Learning task. In sum, existing evidence does not establish
ﬁrmly how or when preschoolers develop the ability to use mental states to
acquire novel words.

One might assume that a more detailed developmental investigation of the
ability to track a speaker’s false beliefs is unnecessary given the wealth of
research on the development of false belief attribution in standard
(non-communicative) contexts. This research has shown that the ability to
correctly report false beliefs (and hence to accurately reason about objects
of belief as distinct from reality) is typically absent in three-year-olds but
emerges by the time children are four or ﬁve years of age (see Wellman,
Cross & Watson, , for a review; but cf. Clements & Perner, ;
Garnham & Ruﬀman, ; Onishi & Baillargeon, ; Southgate, Senju
& Csibra, ; Surian, Caldi & Sperber, ; Buttelmann, Carpenter &
Tomasello, ; Rubio-Fernandez & Geurts, , for evidence of earlier
success with simpler tasks). However, some of the studies mentioned
above have raised the possibility that the developmental timetable for
understanding epistemic states might diﬀer between word-learning and
standard belief-attribution contexts. Happé and Loth’s () study
included a standard false belief Action Prediction task (modiﬁed from
Baron-Cohen et al., ). Children were shown an act-out story in which
a puppet called Sally put her ball in a basket and went out. Another
puppet (‘naughty’ Ann) came in and decided to play a trick on Sally,
moving her ball from the basket to a box. Sally returned and wanted to
play with her ball. Children were asked: “Where will Sally look for her
ball?” It was found that children were more likely to succeed in tracking
false belief in the Word Learning task than in the Action Prediction task.
The authors concluded that understanding thoughts behind words might
be easier for children than understanding thoughts behind actions, and took
their data as tentative evidence supporting the presence of distinct theory
of mind mechanisms supporting action prediction vs. communication
(in accordance with Roth & Leslie, ; Sperber, ; Wilson, ).
Similarly, Carpenter et al. () reported that their sample of three-
year-olds performed very poorly on the same action prediction task, despite
the fact that, as already mentioned, % of these children passed word
learning trials.

One issue with these studies is that there were several asymmetries
between the types of scenarios used to test false belief in action prediction
vs. communication contexts. To take a speciﬁc example, in both Happé
and Loth () and in Carpenter et al. (), the Word Learning
scenario allowed for a tighter association between the protagonist and the
target object compared to the Action Prediction scenario, since, in word
learning trials, the protagonist only ever came into physical contact with
the original object, and never with the object that was used for its
substitution. In the Carpenter et al., study, the diﬀerence was even starker
because the target object was not substituted by another object but
removed from the experimental scene altogether in the Word Learning
scenarios. Thus, when the character who originally hid the object came
back and uttered a word for the object while trying to retrieve it, there
was no candidate referent in the original location for children to
mistakenly label. This manipulation diﬀers markedly from the set-up of
the classic Action Prediction task (see Wimmer & Perner, ; Koos,
Gergeley, Csibra & Biro, ; Wellman et al., ). There are additional
task diﬀerences in the number of objects, hiding locations, and test
questions in Happé and Loth (). Even after removing several such
asymmetries between the two types of scenarios, more recent studies with
three- and four-year-olds by Houston-Price and colleagues (, Exp. 
and ) replicated the advantage of word learning over action prediction
false belief scenarios.
Nevertheless, Houston-Price and colleagues () also showed that the
advantage of word learning scenarios could be eliminated. Following
Perner, Rendi, and Garnham (), they hypothesized that the Action
Prediction questions (“Where will X look for Y?”) in prior studies and
their own initial experiments required greater resistance to a ‘reality bias’
exerted by the actual location of the target object that the protagonist
desired compared to the Word Learning questions (“Which one is the
modi?”) that involved a not-yet-established referential link. Houston-Price
et al. (, Exp. ) modiﬁed the Action Prediction task used in their
previous experiments in a way known to powerfully reduce the ‘reality
pull’ (Wimmer & Perner, ; Wellman et al., ): in the new version,
after the target object was switched by a second character, the character
would remove both objects and leave. As expected, children performed
better in this Action Prediction task compared to the earlier version;
furthermore, and crucially, the diﬀerence from the Word Learning task
disappeared. Houston-Price and colleagues concluded that what appeared
to be precocious understanding of false belief in the word-learning domain
was driven by a weaker ‘reality bias’ inherent in the naming task itself.

At present, a synthesis of existing ﬁndings is complicated: only one
experiment so far has failed to produce the asymmetry in false belief
reasoning across domains (Houston-Price et al., , Exp. ), and
conclusions drawn from that experiment critically depend on whether one
accepts the premise that the newly introduced label in the Word Learning
task exerts no or little ‘referential pull’. Notice that this idea is not
supported by independent evidence. In fact, it seems plausible to assume
that the Word Learning task still requires the child to override the
tendency to interpret the tricked speaker’s sentence (e.g. “The modi is in
this box”) as if it refers to the here-and-now of the situation (as the child
currently represents it), and hence to attach the new label for the desired
object to the true contents of the box. On this line of reasoning,
simplifying the Action Prediction task by removing the need to inhibit the
incorrect response (the single most powerful way to boost children’s ability
to pass the false belief task, after the eﬀects of age, according to Wellman
et al.’s () meta-analysis of  studies) created a massive imbalance
with respect to the Word Learning task (that still involved inhibition) –
hence eliminating the previously observed advantage of the latter task.
The alternative explanation sketched above is compatible with the
proposal that understanding false labels develops separately from
understanding false beliefs (since it assumes that the difference is simply
masked in Houston-Price et al., , Exp. ). It is also compatible with
the possibility that task demands – not necessarily related to the weaker
‘reality bias’ in interpreting novel labels – are responsible for the observed
false belief advantage in communicative domains. Notice that, despite
efforts to equate task demands across domains, several major differences
persisted throughout all studies that have reported the word-learning
advantage (see Carpenter et al., ; Happé & Loth, ; Houston-Price
et al., ). For instance, false belief reasoning in non-communicative
contexts targeted location changes and was assessed through a location
question (“Where . . . ?”); answers were given by pointing within the
experimental scene; and false-belief contents involved familiar objects that
belonged to the characters. By contrast, false belief reasoning in
communicative contexts targeted object changes and was assessed through
a referent-choice question (“Which one . . . ?”); answers were given by
selecting one of two objects placed in front of the child but outside the
experimental scene; and false belief contents involved novel objects. One
or more of these differences may have made it easier for children to
disengage their perspective from their own knowledge for purposes of
word learning compared to action prediction. At this point, since several
theoretical options are open, further experimentation is needed to settle
the question whether false belief reasoning is easier in communicative
compared to non-communicative contexts.
In the present experiment, our primary goal was to explore whether young
children track a speaker’s epistemic state (specifically, a false belief) when
learning the meaning of a novel word. We compared three-, four-, and
five-year-olds in a simple Label task that drew on Happé and Loth’s
() Word Learning scenarios. In this task, one character placed a novel
object into a box and left. A second character came in and put another
novel object inside the box. The first character then came back and
referred to the object in the box using a novel label (“blicket”). Children
were presented with a choice between the two objects and asked: “Which
one is the blicket?” Of interest was whether children would be able to
reliably handle false beliefs in word learning contexts and how this ability
would change across ages. Success on this task would offer strong support
for the presence of mind-reading skills in children’s early communication,
especially in the face of diverging estimates in the literature (see Carpenter
et al., ; Happé & Loth, ; Houston-Price et al., ).
A secondary goal was to compare preschoolers’ understanding of epistemic
states in word-learning vs. standard belief-reasoning contexts. We thus
tested the same children on a Belief Attribution task that was identical to
the Label task in terms of its questions, structure, and availability of a
‘reality match’ (unlike Carpenter et al., ; Happé & Loth, ;
Houston-Price et al., ). The only difference was that, at the end of the
story, the first character came back and, instead of introducing a novel
word, simply approached the box. Children were then shown the two
objects and asked: “Which one does <the character> think is inside the
box?” Unlike earlier studies, we did not ask children to predict the
protagonist’s action but to access the protagonist’s thoughts. These two
methods are equivalent in terms of assessing false belief reasoning
(Wellman et al., ). This design allowed us to test three currently open
theoretical possibilities. If the previously demonstrated advantage of
communicative contexts was due to distinctly developing theory-of-mind
mechanisms (Carpenter et al., ; Happé & Loth, ), then our data
should show better performance on the (False) Label compared to the
(False) Belief Attribution scenarios. If the advantage of communicative
contexts was due to the lack of a strong ‘referential pull’ towards the
incorrect answer during the interpretation of a novel word compared to
non-word contexts (Houston-Price et al., ), the asymmetry should
also persist. But if the advantage of communicative contexts was due to task
differences in past studies that selectively encouraged perspective-shifting in
word-learning contexts, it should disappear.
In line with prior work (Carpenter et al., ; Happé & Loth, ;
Houston-Price et al., ), we also included True Belief trials. These
trials preceded the main task and were identical to the false belief scenarios
except that the protagonist was present when the object switch occurred.
Two such pretest trials were administered, one involving Belief
Attribution and the other Labeling. These trials served as a control for the
possibility that children might associate a character with the object he/she
placed in a box and might thus appear to succeed in the false belief trials
without truly computing the character’s mental state. If children followed
this strategy, they would fail in the true belief trials, since the object that
the first character placed in a box is not the object this character thinks is
in the box / labels at the end of a true belief story. We therefore sought to
ascertain that children could pass at least one, if not both, of these true
belief pretests.

EXPERIMENT.
METHOD.
Participants.
Participants fell into three age groups. The three-year-old group consisted of
thirty-eight children between the ages of ; and ; (mean age: ;). The
four-year-old group consisted of sixty-one children between the ages of ;
and ; (mean age: ;). The five-year-old group consisted of thirty-nine
children between the ages of ; and ; (mean age: ;). (Four-year-olds
were sampled more heavily because their behavior on False Belief
computation is variable and thus they might have been more likely than
the other two groups to reveal dissociations, if any, between types of False
Belief tasks.) Participants were recruited from daycares in Newark, DE.
Additional children were tested but excluded from the final sample for either
failing all Memory questions within a single False or True Belief task (n = )
or not answering test questions (n = ).
Materials and procedure.
Children were tested individually in a quiet room of their daycare.
Materials included videotaped stories with various puppets displayed on
a laptop. Each child saw four test stories, all of which involved False
Belief scenarios. The test stories involved deception, a feature known to
improve false belief performance (Chandler, Fritz & Hala, ;
Sullivan & Winner, ; Wellman et al., ; see also Happé &
Loth, ). There were two within-subjects tasks, a Label and a Belief
Attribution task, with two test stories assigned to each task type (see
the ‘Appendix’ for a sample story). In a typical test story, a wolf
named Lucy appeared on the screen and introduced herself to the
children. The wolf then drew the children’s attention to a novel object
in her hands (“Look what I have! Let’s put it away now. Let’s put it
in this box to keep it safe!”). The wolf then placed the object into a
box in the center of the screen. Then she said: “I’m tired now, so I’m
going to take a nap. Will you watch this while I’m asleep? Keep it safe
while I take a nap!” Then the wolf left. A monkey then came in
holding another novel object and introduced himself as David. Then
the monkey said: “Look what I have! Let’s play a trick on Lucy.
Ready? Let’s be very quiet so we don’t wake Lucy. I take this one out
of the box and put this one in.” The experimenter next paused the
video and asked the children where Lucy went. If a child failed to
respond, the experimenter answered that Lucy was taking a nap.
Then the experimenter asked a Perception question (“Can the wolf see
what the monkey is doing?”). Children responded correctly % of the
time. The experimenter showed agreement with correct responses (“You’re
right! She can’t because she’s away taking a nap!”). In the rare case that
children responded incorrectly, the experimenter corrected them (“No, she
can’t! She’s away taking a nap!”).
Next, David switched the objects and left the scene taking Lucy’s object
with him. Then, Lucy returned. In the version of the story for the Label
task, Lucy named the object in the box (“It’s time to play with the modi!
Remember the modi? There’s a modi in this box!”). In the version of the
story for the Belief Attribution task, Lucy remained silent. The decision
to have the protagonist remain silent (and not, for instance, talk about
“the toy” without naming it) was made so as to maximize the difference
between a communicative and a non-communicative context: for children,
having to identify the correct referent for the noun phrase “the toy” would
have introduced a linguistic interpretation task into the Belief Attribution
task (see Robinson & Mitchell, , ; and ‘General discussion’).
At the end of each video, the experimenter presented children with the
same two novel objects seen in the video. The objects were placed on the
table in front of the children. In the Label task, the experimenter asked
children to point to the newly named object (“Which one is the modi?”).
In the Belief Attribution task, children were asked to identify which object
the main character thought was in the box (“Which one does the wolf
think is in the box?”). If a child avoided choosing in either task, the
experimenter asked the child to hand over the target object rather than
point. The need for this occurred very rarely.
The experimenter went on to ask the children two Memory questions
(“Which toy did the wolf put in the box? Which toy did the monkey put
in the box?”). The Memory questions served as a control to ensure that
children encoded the event correctly (see also Baldwin, ; Happé &
Loth, ). Children answered both of these questions within a trial
correctly % of the time; those trials were entered into subsequent
analyses. Finally, the experimenter asked a Preference question (“Which
toy is your favorite?”). The Preference question was included to ensure
that children’s responses were not driven by a strong preference for one
object over the other (following Baldwin, ; Happé & Loth, ).
Responses revealed no reliable preference for one over the other toy within
a trial. Furthermore, participants did not choose their preferred objects
during the False Belief test trials at levels significantly different from
chance (M= %, p > ·).
Materials also included two True Belief pretest stories (see ‘Appendix’ for
an example). One of these stories involved a Label and the other a Belief
Attribution task. The stories, script, and questions in the pretests
(including the Perception, Memory, and Preference control questions)
were identical to the False Belief test items except that the character was
present while the objects were switched. Overall, participants understood
that, when the character was present, he/she could see the object
substitution, as evidenced by the fact that % of responses in the
Perception question were correct. Children also remembered the prior
event, as shown by the fact that they gave correct responses to both
Memory questions % of the time. As in the main phase of the
experiment, participants in the True Belief trials did not show a consistent
bias for one or the other object within a trial in the Preference question,
nor did they consistently pick preferred objects in answering True Belief
pretest questions (M= %, p > ).
Each story used different characters, objects, and labels (for tests: modi,
blicket; for pretests: zavin, gogi). Half of the main characters were male
and half female. The characters’ statements were prerecorded with a
distinct speaker for each character. The direction (left–right) the character
moved in when entering/exiting, and the placement (left–right) of the
correct object on the table were counterbalanced across trials. Test stories
for each task were administered in blocks, and both block order and story
order within blocks were counterbalanced. Pretest story order was fixed,
with Label stories administered first. Across subjects, assignment of each
test and pretest story to task was counterbalanced. No subject saw versions
of the same story across both the Belief Attribution and Label tasks.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION.
True belief pretests.
We excluded pretest trials where children failed Memory questions (% of
the data). To ensure that our participants were engaged and understood the
task, we also excluded from subsequent analyses children that passed noTrue
Belief pretest trials despite answering the corresponding Memory questions
correctly ( three-year-olds,  four-year-olds, and  five-year-olds). The
total remaining sample thus consisted of  participants. Of these, %
passed all True Belief trials for which the Memory questions were answered
correctly ( three-year-olds,  four-year-olds, and  five-year-olds). The
remaining % of participants passed one of the two pretest trials for which
they had answered Memory questions correctly ( three-year-olds, 
four-year-olds, and  five-year-olds). When children succeeded with only
one of the two pretests, they were equally likely to succeed on the Label
compared to the Belief Attribution pretest.
It might appear puzzling that a substantial number of children had
difficulties with True Belief trials. Nevertheless, similar difficulties in True
Belief word-learning tests have been reported in both Happé and Loth’s
() study and across all three experiments in Houston-Price et al.
() (these studies did not include True Belief Attribution scenarios).
The difficulties we (and others) observed in the pretests may have been
due in part to the nature of True Belief stories, where the absence of
deception could have confused children or made them less interested in
the story (see Sullivan & Winner, ; Wellman et al., , for evidence
that children tend to prefer stories that feature deception). Moreover, the
need for children to track the actions of two characters and answer our
Perception and Memory questions may have increased the cognitive load
and led to poorer performance (see also Houston-Price et al., ).
False belief test trials.
We excluded % of the trials because of failures in the Memory controls.
We defined passing each False Belief task as answering correctly all
remaining trials within the task (i.e. trials on which Memory questions
had been correct). Since children in the majority of cases passed the Memory
questions in both trials of each task, this meant that they had to answer both
trials within a task to be considered passers. Otherwise, children were
considered failers. The number of children within each age group that
passed or failed each task is given in Table  and will be used for all
analyses that follow.
Label task. Beginning with the main point of interest, performance on the
Label task changed with age. Only about a third (/) of the
three-year-olds passed the task, but the vast majority of five-year-olds did
so (/), with four-year-olds’ performance being intermediate (/
passed). A chi-square test confirmed that there was an association between
age and whether participants passed or failed (χ = ·, df=, p < ·).
A further series of chi-square tests on  ×  contingency tables containing
the numbers of passers and failers for pairs of age groups showed that age
was associated with performance in the analysis of three- vs. five-year-olds
(χ = ·, df=, p < ·), three- vs. four-year-olds (χ = ·, df=,
p = ·), and four- vs. five-year olds (χ = ·, df=, p = ·).
Moreover, three-year-olds had equal numbers of passers and failers in the
Label task (n =  vs. , p = ·, two-tailed binomial, n.s.), as did
four-year-olds (n =  vs. , p = ·, n.s), whereas five-year-olds had
significantly more passers than failers (n =  vs. , p < ·, two-tailed
binomial).
Belief attribution task. As Table  shows, results from the Belief
Attribution task are consistent with prior literature on theory-of-mind
development. Only a third (/) of the three-year-olds passed the Belief
Attribution task, but the vast majority of five-year-olds (/) did so,
with four-year-olds’ performance being intermediate (/ passed). A
chi-square test confirmed that there was an association between age and
whether participants passed or failed (χ = ·, df=, p < ·). A
further series of chi-square tests on  ×  contingency tables containing the
numbers of passers and failers for pairs of age groups showed that, as with
the Label task, age was associated with performance in all comparisons:
three- vs. five-year-olds (χ = ·, df=, p < ·), four- vs. five-yearolds
(χ = ·, df=, p = ·), and three- vs. four-year-olds (χ = ·,
df = , p = ·).
Moreover, as expected, the extent to which children could reliably pass the
false Belief Attribution task differed by age: in both three-year-olds and
four-year-olds, the number of passers did not differ from the number of
failers (s:  vs. , respectively, p = ·; s:  vs. , p = ·,
two-tailed binomial, n.s.), but in five-year-olds, the number of passers was
reliably higher than the number of failers (s:  vs. , p < ·, two-tailed
binomial).
We considered the possibility that children’s choices in the False Belief
test trials could have been based on superficial associations between a
character and the object he/she placed in the box: if so, there would be
more successes in False Belief compared to True Belief trials. For both
pretests and tests, we defined passing as answering correctly all trials on
which Memory questions had been correct. The number of children passing
pretests was either marginally greater than those passing tests (n =  vs. 
in three-year-olds, p = ·) or very close (n =  vs.  in four-year-olds,
p = ·, n.s.; and n =  vs.  in five-year-olds, p = ·, n.s.). Thus this
possibility is not supported by our data (see also Houston-Price et al., ,
for a similar pattern and conclusion).
Comparison between the label and belief attribution tasks. We compared
performance on the Label and Belief Attribution task using the number of
children who passed only one of the two tasks as an index of task
difficulty. As in Happé and Loth (), we conducted McNemar’s tests
with Yates’ continuity correction looking at the number of children across
all age groups that passed only one task (n = ). The test revealed no
difference between Label-Only and Belief-Attribution-Only passers ( vs. ,
respectively, χ = ·, df=, p = ·, n.s.).
We repeated this analysis, focusing only on the subset of children who
passed all pretest trials for which they had answered Memory trials
correctly and could thus be argued to have the strongest understanding
of our task (n = ). Of these children,  passed both False Belief tasks
and  failed both. Again, Label-Only passers were no different from
Belief-Attribution-Only passers ( vs. , χ = ·, df=, p = ·).
To probe further into the relative difficulty of the Belief Attribution and
Label tasks, we asked whether the order in which the tasks were received
affected children’s performance. If reasoning about false labels were easier
than reasoning about false beliefs, then performance on the Belief
Attribution task might be facilitated in those children who received the
Label task first compared to children who received the Label task last;
however, performance on the Label task itself should not be facilitated
(and might even be hurt) by prior exposure to the Belief Attribution task.
Closer inspection of the data revealed that task order was unrelated to task
performance. Thirty-eight out of the  children in the final sample (or
%) who received the Belief Attribution task first passed the task and 
out of  children (or %) who received the same task last passed it.
Similarly,  out of the  children (or %) who received the Label task

GENERAL DISCUSSION.
Our study led to two main results. First, young children consult the
epistemic state of a speaker during word learning, and this ability develops
between the ages of three and five. Specifically, our data show that
five-year-olds successfully acquired a word from a speaker with a false
belief by accurately tracing the speaker’s referential intent. As shown in
Table , these children avoided associating a novel word with a novel
object inside a box when the speaker had a mistaken belief about what was
in the box: the children instead attached the word to the object that
accurately corresponded to the speaker’s epistemic state. Some three- and
four-year-olds also succeeded in these contexts: even though, as a group,
these children were not above chance in the Label task, individual data
show that about half of the three- and four-year-olds actually passed the
task. This finding settles a disagreement in prior reports on children’s
ability to handle accidentally false labels (Carpenter et al., ; Happé &
Loth, ; Houston-Price et al., ) and clarifies the developmental
trajectory of this ability (see also Mitchell, Robinson & Thompson, ).
The present study adds to the literature documenting the extent to which
preschoolers track a speaker’s mental state (e.g. whether the speaker is
knowledgeable vs. uninformed, or has limited vs. full knowledge) when
acquiring information, including novel words, from that speaker (Sabbagh
& Baldwin, ; Koenig & Harris, ; Jaswal & Neely, ; Saylor &
Troseth, ; Birch et al., ; Nurmsoo & Bloom, ; Rakoczy,
Warneken & Tomasello, ; Robinson & Nurmsoo, ; Bannard &
Tomasello, ). Our data are consistent with a broadly pragmatic
perspective on word learning emerging from this and related literature:
according to this perspective, children do not simply associate novel words
with the objects contextually tied to the act of naming but use information
about the speaker’s mental state to attribute reference to newly
encountered words.
A second result from this work is that young children’s ability to recognize
that someone can err because of a false belief, and that someone can offer an
erroneous label because of a false belief, develops around the same time (and
in accordance with the well-documented transition in false belief reasoning in
Wimmer & Perner, ; Baron-Cohen et al., ; Wellman et al., ;
among many others). This result differs from earlier studies (Carpenter et al.,
; Happé & Loth, ) that had shown an advantage in mental-state
reasoning for communicative over non-communicative contexts: in Happé
and Loth’s () study, for instance, % of the children who passed only
one task passed the Label task, whereas in the present data only % of
children did so. Notice that, compared to those previous studies, the present
design included a higher overall number of participants (n = , compared
to less than  in the final analyses of H&L) and a higher number of children
who passed only one task (n = , compared to n =  in H&L). Our design
also includes a higher number of participants compared to each of the first
two experiments in Houston-Price et al. () that also showed the
asymmetry. The present data do not support a difference in false belief
performance between communicative and non-communicative contexts, nor
do they offer a basis for treating these as products of distinct mechanisms, as
proposed by Happé and Loth () and Carpenter et al. ().
Our study is close in spirit to more recent proposals that attributed the
divergence in children’s false belief performance between word-learning and
action-prediction contexts to task parameters (Houston-Price et al., ; note
that our own methods compare word-learning to belief-attribution, not
action-prediction, but the latter two tasks have been shown to be equivalent;
Wellman et al., ). Our approach diverges, however, from these earlier
proposals in two important respects. First, our study is the first one to date to
use truly balanced tasks (in fact, the very same task) to compare children’s false
belief reasoning across word learning and belief attribution domains. Unlike
Houston-Price et al. (), our design makes no additional assumptions
about how false belief is calculated within each domain and is therefore not
subject to issues of interpretation arising from the prior paradigm (see
‘Introduction’). Therefore, as far as we can tell, the present data offer the first
unambiguous evidence so far for the role of methodological imbalances in
what appeared to be an advantage of communicative over non-communicative
false belief contexts in prior work.
Second, and relatedly, our study offers no support for the role of the
specific task parameters identified in prior work as being responsible for
children’s performance differences. Recall that, according to Houston-Price
and colleagues (), the advantage of communicative contexts was
due to the higher ‘pull of the real’ exerted by the child’s knowledge of the
correct response in traditional false belief contexts compared to contexts
that asked about the interpretation of a newly introduced word (see also
Perner et al., ). In our own study, however, other things being equal, the
‘pull of the real’ (e.g. the child’s knowledge of the actual contents of a box
following a surreptitious content-change) created no selective deficit in
children’s performance in the Belief Attribution task. This outcome
supports the conclusion that both the Belief Attribution task and the Word
Learning task in prior work (as well as our own) involve suppressing the
incorrect answer (and that the pattern of results in Houston-Price et al.,
, Exp. , rather than demonstrating the role of a ‘reality bias’, probably
resulted from the selective simplification of the Action Prediction task that
removed the need to inhibit the incorrect answer).
Our findings are reminiscent of work that examined the relationship
between children’s false belief understanding and reference assignment for
(known) noun phrases. Robinson and Mitchell (; see also Robinson &
Mitchell, ) presented children with scenarios in which a character
asked for “the bag in the red drawer” in a situation in which
(unbeknownst to the character) the bag had been switched with the bag in
the blue drawer. Many children as young as three and four years could
correctly pick the bag that the character “really wanted” (children were
also accurate in a ‘true belief’ control task, in which the bags were
removed but then returned to their original locations). Furthermore,
children appeared to be better in this referential task compared to a
standard false belief task involving change of location. However, further
experimentation – including tasks that were more carefully matched across
the referential and standard false-belief versions (Robinson & Mitchell,
) – failed to replicate the asymmetry. Much as in the present
experiment, Robinson and Mitchell concluded that both types of false
belief task were actually equally difficult for children.
The present results raise several further questions. A first question is what
is responsible for the youngest children’s failures in mental-state reasoning,
and (relatedly) whether different contexts might lead very young children to
pass the false label task. Notice that, unlike prior studies in which a speaker’s
lack of knowledge about the referent of a novel word was established through
explicit cues (e.g. “I don’t know what a blicket is. Maybe it’s this one.”
Sabbagh & Baldwin, ) or past unreliable naming episodes (Koenig &
Harris, ), in the present study children had to infer a character’s false
belief from tracking that character’s perspective. Furthermore, perspectivetracking
was assessed through standard, rather protracted scenarios in which
children observed interactions between characters and objects but did not
participate in the interactions themselves. This line of reasoning leaves open
the possibility that in simpler, more participatory contexts, even younger
children might succeed in reading the mind of the speaker (see Nurmsoo &
Bloom, ; Southgate, Chevallier & Csibra, , for relevant evidence; cf.
alsoWarneken & Tomasello, ; Csibra & Gergely, , for discussion).
A second question raised by the present data is whether preschoolers’
ability to engage in mental state reasoning might extend to situations
beyond word learning. A prominent case in point is the calculation of
pragmatic inference, where adults are known to ‘take the epistemic step’
(Bergen & Grodner, ; Breheny, Ferguson & Katsos, ) but
preschoolers have been reported to face difficulties (e.g. Noveck, ;
Papafragou & Musolino, ; Huang & Snedeker, ). This issue bears
directly on the current debate about children’s use and limits of theory of
mind computations during communication more broadly (see, e.g.
Diesendruck & Markson, ; Epley et al., ; Breheny, ; de
Marchena et al., ) and is ripe for further research.
