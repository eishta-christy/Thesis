Brief description of the content 
Language users communicate through discourse. The constituting property of discourse is 
that it shows connectedness. This connectedness is a mental phenomenon: Language users 
make a coherent representation of the discourse under consideration. The discourse itself 
contains (more or less) overt signals that direct this interpretation process.  
  
I will substantiate these ideas in this course and focus on one of the main ways in which 
discourse coherence manifests itself, namely in coherence relations that establish the 
relationship between discourse segments, such as Cause-Consequence and Contrast. These 
relations are conceptual and they can, but need not, be made explicit by linguistic markers, 
so-called connectives (because, so, however, although) and lexical cue phrases (For that 
reason, As a result, On the other hand).  
 
I will present the outlines of a cognitive theory of coherence relations, which accounts for the 
relationship between discourse as a linguistic object and the mental representation people 
have or make of it. Such an approach requires an interdisciplinary methodology. This is 
illustrated with studies using both linguistic and psycholinguistic research methods and data, 
varying from text analysis to on-line processing and language acquisition. 
 
Lecture 1 
From Cohesion to Coherence: Toward a cognitive theory of discourse connectedness 
One of the central questions in discourse studies is: how can connectedness be characterized? 
There are two leading answers in the literature: Cohesion and Coherence. We will focus on 
coherence relations. A basic tenet of the course will be that in order understand the 
regularities behind coherence relations properly we have to look at those relations as 
cognitive entities (and not merely as handy tools for text analysis). A framework for 
describing coherence relations will be presented. I will specifically go into the need for 
classifying coherence relations and connectives, and for evidence for those classifications. 
The meaning and use of connectives in several languages will be discussed on the basis of 
cross-linguistic comparison.  
 
Lecture 2.  
Cognitive Complexity in discourse? Acquisition and processing of coherence relations 
and connectives 
The processing and acquisition of coherence relations and their markers provides much 
insight into the intricate relation between the surface code and the meaning representation 
that readers make of such a text. We will first discuss psycholinguistic evidence for the role 
of the surface code in creating a text representation, and investigate how the conceptual 

relations themselves influence discourse processing. Then, we move to child language data. 
Finally, we will explore whether the evidence from these different methods converges, by 
focusing on the notion of cognitive complexity. Negative relations, for instance, are 
considered more complex than positive ones. This linguistic analysis is corroborated by 
cognitive studies: negative relations take more processing time and children acquire them 
later. But how about causal relations?
