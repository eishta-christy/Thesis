ABSTRACT
The nature of structural language difﬁculties in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was
explored in a comparative study with speciﬁc language impairment (SLI) through investigation of the
frequently reported ASD weakness in receptive skills relative to expressive skills. Twenty French-
speaking children with ASD aged 6 to 12 were compared to age-matched children with SLI on produc-
tion and comprehension of wh-questions. The two groups displayed similar effects of the complexity
of the different wh-strategies. In the ASD group (as in the SLI group), these effects were not greater in
comprehension compared to production; moreover, nonverbal ability (which varied from normal to im-
paired) was not related to language performance. Observed ASD-SLI differences are argued to largely
be due to ASD pragmatic deﬁcits, rather than to a qualitative difference in structural language skills.

Human communication involves linguistic knowledge (grammar, lexicon, and
sound structure), as well as knowledge about the context within which it is used
(what can be inferred about the speaker’s intentions, etc.). This latter type of
knowledge, pragmatics, has received considerable attention in studies on autism,
and impairment in this domain is considered a core feature of autism spectrum dis-
order (ASD; see Baron-Cohen, 1988; Boucher, 2003). By contrast, formal aspects
of language (those concerning sound, word, and sentence structure) have been

much less investigated in ASD, especially in languages other than English. This
is despite consensus among scholars regarding the existence of frequent formal
language impairment in children with ASD (for overviews, see Boucher, 2012;
Eigsti, de Marchena, Schuh, & Kelley, 2011; and Groen, Zwiers, Van der Gaag, &
Buitelaar, 2008), though rates and underlying nature of this impairment have been
understudied. Recent work has brought this issue to the forefront in the context of
the question of whether the language difﬁculties observed in some children with
ASD are similar to those found in children with speciﬁc language impairment
(SLI; for a review, see Williams, Botting, & Boucher, 2008).1 Moreover, it has
been suggested that an “inverse” production–comprehension dissociation charac-
terizes language in children with ASD, with comprehension difﬁculties overshad-
owing production difﬁculties (for a review, see Boucher, 2012), and persistence
of comprehension problems constituting a signiﬁcant difference with SLI (Rutter,
Mawhood, & Howlin, 1992), though the validity of this characterization remains
unclear (Kwok, Brown, Smyth, & Cardy, 2015). This paper aims to contribute to
this inquiry with a study comparing children with ASD to children with SLI on
alternative ways of forming wh-questions in French. Our goal was to determine if
production and comprehension of wh-questions show the same patterns of relative
avoidance/preference in production and difﬁculty in comprehension in these two
populations.

LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT IN ASD AND SLI

According to the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10;
World Health Organization, 2010), both ASD and SLI are disorders of psycholog-
ical development. ASD is characterized by impaired communication and social
interactions and by restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behavior (see DSM-5;
American Psychiatric Association, 2013). A large proportion of children with
ASD also have intellectual deﬁcits. Regarding language skills, there is consider-
able variation among children with ASD. In addition to the well-known pragmatic
difﬁculties experienced by children with ASD, some children also experience vary-
ing degrees of semantic, morphosyntactic, and/or phonological impairment (Lord,
Risi, & Pickles, 2004; Tager-Flusberg, 2006; Wilkinson, 1998). SLI is a disor-
der affecting language in the absence of any primary disorder such as intellectual
disability, auditory/perceptual impairment, or obvious neurological dysfunction.
One language domain particularly affected in children with SLI is morphosyntax
(Leonard, 2014). Because morphosyntax may also be impaired in children with
ASD, the question arises as to the extent, the nature, and the implications of the in-
tersection between ASD and SLI (see Bishop, 2010; Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg,
2001; Tager-Flusberg, 2004, 2006; Tomblin, 2011). ASD-SLI studies that have
sought to elucidate these questions through direct, comparative investigation of
these two populations are relatively few in number. These began with Bartak, Rut-
ter, and Cox’s (1975) study, and the large clinical cohort studies undertaken by
Allen and Rapin (1992), Rapin (1996), and Tuchman, Rapin, and Shinnar (1991;
for an overview and an integrative analysis of these, see also Rapin & Dunn,
2003). These have been followed by a dozen other, smaller studies published in
the last decade, which have also focused on English-speaking children (Leyfer,

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5

Tager-Flusberg, Dowd, Tomblin, & Folstein, 2008; Lloyd, Paintin, & Botting,
2006; Loucas et al., 2008, 2010, 2013; Pickles et al., 2009; Whitehouse, Barry,
& Bishop, 2008; Williams, Payne, & Marshall, 2013), with few exceptions (De-
mouy et al., 2011; Durrleman & Delage, 2016; Geurts & Embrechts, 2008; Zebib,
Tuller, Prévost, & Morin, 2013). Ultimately, identifying the nature of language
deﬁcits that some children with ASD have could lead to the identiﬁcation of spe-
ciﬁc subgroups of children with autism, which in turn would contribute to better
understanding of autism and the development of appropriate care.

The principal objective of this paper is to explore aspects of structural lan-
guage in children with ASD in both production and comprehension, as part of the
overarching goal of documenting language proﬁles in these children. It has often
been reported that children with ASD have higher abilities in expression than in
reception (Boucher, 2003, 2012; Charman et al., 2003; Lloyd et al., 2006; Rutter
et al., 1992), and these reports echo observations frequently made by clinicians. In
a recent review, Kwok et al. (2015) found that the (few) studies directly comparing
receptive/expressive modalities did not all show an advantage for production over
reception, with some showing the opposite dissociation, and some no dissociation
at all. Furthermore, their meta-analysis of 74 studies reporting on either receptive
or expressive language found no evidence for a typical expression-over-reception
pattern in children with ASD. This was true for studies of vocabulary, as well as for
studies that included measures of global language ability. However, Kwok et al.
underlined several important lacuna in the literature, concluding that the number
of studies reporting measures of structural language made it impossible for them to
run a separate analysis for this domain, and thus to determine whether there might
be some kind of receptive–expressive dissociation for this aspect of language. One
of the major conclusions for their study was the need for further exploration of
grammar and syntax.

Moreover, Kwok et al. (2015) found that the participants in the extant literature
did not form a representative sample, and speciﬁcally that low-functioning chil-
dren were underrepresented in studies of children after age 6, making it probable,
in their view, that language abilities in school-age children and youth might be
overestimated. The underlying assumption here is that it is reasonable to imagine
that language should be more affected in children with ASD who have intellec-
tual disability than in those who do not, and perhaps comprehension might be
even more affected in children with this proﬁle. If this is the case, then potential
receptive–expressive language gaps may not have been adequately explored in
these children. It might further be supposed that, more generally, performance on
speciﬁc aspects of language could be more affected by nonverbal ability. A few
studies have reported on difﬁculties in comprehension of particular morphosyntac-
tic constructions, such as object relative clauses (Durrlemann & Zafferey, 2013),
accusative clitics (Terzi, Marinis, Kotsopoulou, & Konstantinos, 2014), passives
(Perovic, Modyanova, Hanson, Nelson, & Wexler, 2007; Terzi et al., 2014), and
binding (Perovic, Modyanovs, & Wexler, 2013a, 2013b). However, these did not
all include children from the entire autism spectrum (some only included high-
functioning children), which suggests that the question of the relationship between
nonverbal ability and language comprehension/language performance in ASD is
still very much an open, empirical question.

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5

1098

The relationship between language skills and cognitive development in ASD
has received attention in the literature. Some studies suggest that children with
ASD have language skills similar to typically or atypically developing children of
the same cognitive level (Howlin, 1984; Tager-Flusberg et al., 1990); others argue
that linguistic deﬁcits in children with ASD may be speciﬁc, independent of their
nonverbal ability (Eigsti, Bennetto, & Dadlani, 2007; Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg,
2001; Perovic et al., 2013b). These latter studies appear to go in the same direction
as studies investigating SLI, which is, by deﬁnition, independent of nonverbal IQ,
and so-called nonspeciﬁc language impairment, children with language impair-
ment and low cognition, but no other developmental disability (see Rice, 2016,
for recent discussion). The question of a possible overlap between SLI and ASD
is in this way tightly connected to the issue of whether low nonverbal IQ can be
regarded as “the driver for language impairments in children” (Rice, 2016). ASD-
SLI comparative studies differ in how this question is approached. Some studies
have focused on whether there are children with ASD who resemble children with
SLI in having both normal nonverbal IQ and impaired structural language (Geurts
& Embrechts, 2008; Leyfer et al., 2008; Loucas et al., 2008, 2010, 2013; Riches,
Loucas, Baird, Charman, & Simonoff, 2010, 2011; Whitehouse et al., 2008;
Williams, Payne, & Marshall, 2013). Others have sought to document language
proﬁles in verbal children with ASD, regardless of nonverbal cognitive proﬁles and
to explore the incidence of structural language impairment more widely (Demouy
et al., 2011; Durrleman & Delage, 2016; Lloyd et al., 2006; Pickles et al., 2009;
Rapin 1996; Rey, Tardif, Delahaie, Thomas, & Massion, 2001; Tuchman et al.,
1991). We will be pursuing this second approach, bearing in mind, however, the
possible inﬂuence of nonverbal ability, which will be directly addressed, as will
the question of how ASD language proﬁles might best be explored.

SYNTACTIC COMPLEXITY AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT:
WH-QUESTIONS IN FRENCH

In this paper, we address the question of the nature of structural language impair-
ment, and, more speciﬁcally, of the reported receptive disadvantage in verbal chil-
dren with ASD, by focusing on the complexity of syntactic computation in children
with ASD. Recent research shows that both typical and atypical language devel-
opment is constrained by computational complexity, with more complex construc-
tions emerging later than constructions involving less complexity (Chillier et al.,
2001; Friedmann, Belletti, & Rizzi, 2009; Hamman, Tuller, Monjauze, Delage, &
Henry, 2007; Jakubowicz & Nash, 2001; van der Lely, 2005). Among proposals
that have aimed at characterizing particular aspects of complexity, Jakubowicz’s
(2011) computational complexity hypothesis postulated that accumulation of the
operations involved in linguistic computation, in particular internal merge and ex-
ternal merge, is quite challenging for young children and individuals with language
pathology. We focus in this study on this speciﬁc aspect of computational com-
plexity. Children may in effect avoid a complex structure by producing an alterna-
tive sentence involving fewer operations, or by adopting compensatory strategies,
such as omission or substitution, which reduce the computational complexity of a
derivation. Computational complexity may also impact on comprehension. A clear

example is that of object relative clauses, which have been argued to involve a high
degree of complexity, and are exceedingly difﬁcult for young children and for chil-
dren with SLI, yielding subject relative interpretations, in comprehension, and, in
production, alternative structures that are simpler, though sometimes inappropriate
or ungrammatical (Friedmann et al., 2009).

Wh-questions are a particularly useful area of French syntax for assessing com-
putational complexity and its impact on language development, in that several
grammatical constructions varying in complexity are available, from wh–in situ to
wh-fronting with V-to-I movement followed by I-to-C movement (which we refer
to by the traditional term subject/verb inversion), some of which are illustrated
in (1), where wh-constructions are listed according to increasing complexity, and
which are all ways of asking a question about the object of the verb push.2

In (1a), the object wh-word qui “who” follows the verb pousses “push,” the so-
called in situ position. This matches the canonical verb–object order in French. In
contrast, the sentences in (1b)–(1e) all display the object wh-word qui in a pre-
verbal position, which renders them more complex than the wh–in situ strategy in
(1a). Speciﬁcally, it is assumed that the wh-word moves from its base-generated
postverbal position via internal merge to a higher position in the structure of the
sentence (Chomsky, 1995).3 A dependency relation is therefore established be-
tween the wh-word and its base-generated position, and it is precisely this kind of
relationship that children with SLI are assumed to have difﬁculties with (see, e.g.,
van der Lely, 2005). Under this assumption, wh-questions with wh-fronting and
subject/verb inversion (which involves a subject clitic), as in (1f), or wh-fronting
and stylistic inversion (which involves a full lexical subject DP), as in (1g), rep-
resent the most complex types since they involve two internal merge operations:
that of the wh-word to the front of the sentence as well as that involved in the
noncanonical order of the verb with respect to its subject: I-to-C in the case of
subject/verb inversion and overt movement of the subject to a position higher than
SpecVP in the case of stylistic inversion (see Kayne & Pollock, 2001). In these

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5

1100

sentences, two dependency relationships must be established, which is particu-
larly difﬁcult for children with SLI (see van der Lely, 2005). As to (1b) and (1c),
both involve wh-fronting, but (1c) is more complex than (1b) since it also includes
external merge of a question marker est-ce que (ESK; also part of the derivation
of (1g)). Jakubowicz (2011) argued that clefts ((1d)–(1e)) are more complex, as
they entail both external merge (of the wh-word in the matrix clause) and internal
merge (of an empty operator, identiﬁed by the overt wh-word). Firthermore, (1e)
includes a cleft construction and movement of the clefted wh-word, which makes
it more complex than (1d).

Some of the interrogative strategies, wh–in situ, plain wh-fronting, and wh-
fronting with ESK, are very frequent in spoken French, while wh-fronting with
subject/verb inversion is much rarer (see Coveney, 1996; Quillard, 2000, for some
quantitative ﬁndings), but not altogether absent from the input received by children
(see Prévost, Tuller, Galloux, & Barthez, in press). In particular, it is part of high-
frequency ﬁxed expressions (e.g., Que veux-tu? “What do you want?”) and can be
found in literature for children. It is also associated with a more formal register,
in contrast to the other strategies that are more neutral (although they can occur in
formal contexts; see Coveney, 1996; Quillard, 2000).

Several studies on the development of wh-questions in French by typically de-
veloping (TD) children and children and adolescents with SLI (aged 3 years, 10
months [3;10] to 14;0) have shown that wh–in situ is largely favored in the ear-
liest stages of acquisition, be it in spontaneous production or elicited production.
In contrast, wh-fronting with subject/verb inversion is extremely rare in the pro-
duction data of young children and children with SLI (for typical development,
see Hamann, 2006; Hulk, 1996; Hulk & Zuckerman, 2000; Plunkett, 1999; Strik,
2007; for SLI, see Hamann, 2006; Jakubowicz, 2011).

Studies on the comprehension of wh-questions in French are quite rare, and their
objective has not been to compare performance across wh-strategies. For instance,
Plunkett (2010) looked at object versus subject wh-questions and showed, in dif-
ferent experiments, that object wh-questions with wh–in situ and with wh-fronting
+ ESK were well understood. In patients suffering from agrammatic aphasia, how-
ever, van der Meulen (2004) showed that object questions with wh–in situ were
signiﬁcantly better understood than questions involving wh-fronting. Studies look-
ing at both production and comprehension of other complex structures in French
have generally reported low rates of production despite good comprehension, in-
cluding in children with SLI. Such is the case of object clitics, which appear in
a (noncanonical) preverbal position in French (e.g., Pierre la pousse “Peter her
pushes”; Grüter, 2005; Jakubowicz, Nash, Rigaut, & Giraud, 1998; see Jakubowicz
& Tuller, 2008, for review of other such cases).

Some studies suggest that complex sentences are problematic for children with
ASD. For instance, Condouris, Meyer, and Tager-Flusberg (2003) found that in-
terrogatives are affected in autism. In an analysis of spontaneous speech of 44
individuals with ASD (mean age = 7;3 and normal and impaired nonverbal IQ),
they found low scores on the question/negation subscale of the Index of Pro-
ductive Syntax, a measure assessing the child’s emergent use of particular struc-
tures (Scarborough, 1990). Durrleman and Zufferey (2009), analyzing production
data from two high-functioning children with ASD (aged 3;9 and 5;8), argue that

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5

1101

complex structures are affected by truncation, namely, the top layers of the struc-
tural representations are not systematically projected (Rizzi, 2000). In a study
speciﬁcally investigating the effect of complexity in language performance, Riches
et al. (2010) reported that both high-functioning adolescents with ASD and lan-
guage impairment (mean age = 14;8, n = 16) and adolescents with SLI (mean
age = 15;3, n = 14) were affected by complexity, but more so in the latter. Al-
though individuals with ASD and individuals with SLI tended to make more errors
than age-matched TD adolescents in the production of subject and object relative
clauses, individuals with SLI struggled even more than individuals with ASD on
object relative clauses (deemed to be more complex).

Our goal in the study presented here was to explore the issue of ASD-SLI simi-
larities/differences by focusing on a comparison of production and comprehension
of structures involving varying degrees of computational complexity. We sought
to provide concrete answers to the following speciﬁc questions:

(2) a. Do children with ASD resemble children with SLI in avoiding complex strategies
when they produce wh-questions? Are favored wh-strategies and error types similar
or different in the two groups?

b. Are children with ASD sensitive to complexity in their comprehension of wh-
questions like children with SLI are? Are the same types of questions difﬁcult/easy
to understand in the two groups?

c. Does the nonverbal ability of children with ASD correlate with their performance
on the production and/or comprehension of wh-questions, with lower levels corre-
sponding to greater difﬁculty with complex wh-questions?

GENERAL METHOD

Participants
Twenty verbal children with ASD aged 6;3 to 12;9 (M = 8;7, SD = 1;9) and
20 age-matched children with SLI (range = 6;5–11;2, M = 8;7, SD = 1;8) were
recruited from medical records of specialized sections of French hospitals for this
study (see Appendix A for a detailed presentation of these two groups, and Table 1
below for a summary). All children with ASD had been diagnosed according to
ICD-10 criteria via the Autism Diagnosis Interview—Revised (Lord, Rutter, & Le
Couteur, 1994) and conﬁrmed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule,
module 2 or 3 (Lord, Rutter, DiLavore, & Risi, 1989).4 This group was composed
of 4 girls and 16 boys. Although all the children had language (children who did
not produce three-word utterances regularly were excluded), they differed in terms
of verbal and nonverbal ability, as shown in the Appendix A.5 Available nonverbal
IQ scores, which came from different tests administered at time intervals ranging
from a few months to several years prior to testing time, varied from 48 to 108. In
order to have comparable nonverbal scores, Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices
(RPM; Raven, Court, & Raven, 1986) was administered to all children. Seven of
the 20 children with ASD (6 boys, 1 girl) had scores below the ninth percentile,
which corresponds to a standard score of 80, and were therefore considered low
functioning (LF). These 7 children were aged 6;4 to 10;2 (M = 8;1, SD = 1;5),

compared to an age range of 6;3 to 12;9 (M = 8;10, SD = 1;10) for the 13 other
children, who were high functioning (HF).6

Performance on standardized tests assessing phonology (real-word repetition
from Bilan informatisé de langage oral au Cycle III et au collège; Khomsi, Khomsi,
Parbeau-Guéno, & Pasquet, 2007), morphosyntax (sentence completion from Bi-
lan informatisé de langage oral au Cycle III et au collège), and receptive vocabulary
(Batterie d’évaluation du langage oral de l’enfant aphasique; De Agostini et al.,
1998) showed that 6 children with ASD did not display severe language impair-
ment (set at the –1.65 SD threshold, a cutoff often used in clinical settings in
France; Ramus et al., 2003) in any of the three domains tested. This included 5 HF
children and 1 LF child (see Appendix A). Low scores were obtained by the rest
of the children. In particular, 10 of the 20 children had severe difﬁculties in both
morphosyntax and phonology, while 4 had severe difﬁculties in one and moderate
or no difﬁculties in the other. (See Tuller et al., 2017, for discussion of phonological
impairment in ASD, its incidence, and its nature.)

Crossing performance on nonverbal and verbal standardized tests identiﬁed chil-
dren in each of the logically possible proﬁles: (a) children with HF autism and
normal language abilities (n = 5), (b) children with HF autism and language im-
pairment (n = 8), (c) children with LF autism and normal language abilities (n =
1), and (d) children with LF autism and language impairment (n = 6).7
However, no signiﬁcant correlations were found between nonverbal and ver-
bal performance in the ASD group (receptive vocabulary: rs = .171, p = .485,

1103
df = 17; morphosyntax: rs = .273, p = .243, df = 18; phonology: rs = .397, p =
.083, df = 18). Throughout this paper, we will report on the performances of the
ASD group as a whole, but also of particular subgroups.

The children with SLI were recruited from neuropediatric units of university
teaching hospitals in France. They all had had a conventional diagnosis based on
severely impaired language performance on standardized language batteries com-
monly used by speech and language therapists in this country, in conjunction with
usual exclusionary criteria, including intellectual disability (as measured by the
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children [performance IQ < 80], or an equivalent
evaluation). The SLI group was composed of 12 boys and 8 girls (see Table 1 and
Appendix A for details).

The children with SLI were administered the same standardized language tests
as the children with ASD, as well as RPM. All RPM scores were within norms,
except in three cases (see Appendix A). It was decided to nonetheless keep these
children in the SLI group as they had obtained normal nonverbal ability scores
during clinical assessment. With respect to language, all children with SLI were
severely impaired in at least morphosyntax or phonology, with 12 of 20 having
severe difﬁculties in both domains. In contrast, only 2 children had z scores below
norms in receptive vocabulary. This pattern of results, that is, mean z scores well
below norms on phonology and morphosyntax, and only moderate difﬁculties in
vocabulary, was similar to that observed in the ASD group.8 Mann–Whitney tests
showed no signiﬁcant difference between the ASD group and the SLI group on
receptive vocabulary, U (38) = 156, p = .242, and morphosyntax, U (39) = 135,
p = .081.9 Regarding phonology, the children with SLI performed signiﬁcantly
worse than the children with ASD, U (39) = 75, p < .001, r = –.535, though
strong correlations arose between phonology and morphosyntax in both groups of
children (ASD: rs = .560, p = .012, df = 18; SLI: rs = .731, p < .0001, df =
18). The same tendencies were found when comparing the subgroup of 8 children
with high-functioning autism and language impairment (the HFA-LI subgroup) to
a subgroup of 8 children with SLI matched on nonverbal ability and age.
Finally, our study involved two control groups of TD children, one comprising
17 4-year-olds (M = 4;3, SD = 0;2), approximate language controls for the SLI
group, and the other 12 6-year-olds (M = 6;5, SD = 0;2), who were the same age
as the youngest children in the SLI and ASD groups.

Procedure

Written consent was obtained from the parents of the children who participated
in the study. Testing was organized individually and took place in a quiet room.
The experimental protocol contained standardized measures of language (as seen
above), nonverbal ability (via RPMs), and memory abilities (via forward digit span
and backward digit span, which will not be reported on here). Experimental tasks
included a task of elicited production of clitic pronouns (reported elsewhere) and
two tasks focusing on wh-questions: a production task and a comprehension task
(see below). The protocol, whose total duration was about 2 hr, was divided into
two 1-hr sessions. As the tasks targeting production and comprehension of wh-
questions were relatively long (see below), they were each divided into two equal

parts, which were randomly assigned to the ﬁrst or second testing session (with the
production part always preceding the comprehension part). For the ASD group,
the number of testing sessions varied from one child to another, due to behavior
issues.

EXPERIMENT 1: ELICITED PRODUCTION OF WH-QUESTIONS

Method

In the wh-question production task (Jakubowicz, 2005, an adaptation of an ex-
periment created by Naama Friedmann), the examiner showed the child a picture
containing a character performing an action and a hidden part, as illustrated by
Figure 1a. The child was then told to ask the character a question about the hidden
part (e.g., “Look, here the rabbit is pushing someone, but we can’t see who. To
know who the rabbit is pushing, ask him”). Following the child’s response, the
hidden part was then revealed, as shown in Figure 1b.
Different types of questions were elicited in this task, which were presented in
(pseudo)randomized order: subject (n = 12), object (n = 24; 12 animate and
12 inanimate), and adjunct questions (with comment “how,” où “where,” and
pourquoi “why”; n = 18), for a total of 54 items. The task contained 5 train-
ing items, which followed the same format as the test items. Note that after the 5
training items and the ﬁrst 4 test items, the stimulus only included a description
of the picture (e.g., “Here, the rabbit is pushing someone but we can’t see who”)
followed by “Ask him/her.” In other words, it stopped including an embedded
question (e.g., “To know who the rabbit is pushing”), making the stimulus less
complex.
In this probe, each interrogative strategy illustrated in (1) used by the chil-
dren was analyzed (wh–in situ, plain wh-fronting, wh-fronting + est-ce que, or
wh-fronting + subject/verb inversion) in order to determine whether the children
tended to avoid constructions involving more complex computation.

Results

General success on the task, that is, the number of wh-questions produced by each
child that were appropriate in that they consisted of a wh-question of the type
elicited, provided a base measure upon which use of particular wh-strategies was

explored. We also compared error typologies in the wh-questions produced by the
children.

Appropriate responses and wh-strategies. Figure 2 presents the results concern-
ing the number of appropriate responses produced by the different groups of chil-
dren (/54). The difference between the four groups was signiﬁcant, χ2 (3, N =
69) = 25.830, p < .0001. The children with ASD produced signiﬁcantly fewer
appropriate questions than the children with SLI (ASD: M = 32.7, SD = 14.9 vs.
SLI: M = 46.7, SD = 6.0); U (39) = 87.5, p = .002, r = –.482, the TD4 children (M
= 46.4, SD = 5.9); U (36) = 78.5, p = .005, r = –.459, and the TD6 children (M =
52.3, SD = 1.6); U (31) = 17.5, p < .0001, r = –.708. In particular, 8 children with
ASD (out of 20) produced fewer than 27 expected wh-questions (less than 50%),
compared to 1 child with SLI. The ASD/SLI difference held when the subgroup of
8 children with HFA and LI was compared to an RPM- and age-matched subgroup
of children with SLI, U (15) = 2, p = .002, r = –.788. More generally, there was no
signiﬁcant correlation between the number of appropriate wh-questions produced
and nonverbal ability in the ASD group (rs = .111, p = .643, df = 19).
This difference between the children with ASD and the children with SLI can
be attributed, we argue, to the well-known pragmatic deﬁcit associated with ASD.
Speciﬁcally, the children with ASD may have had difﬁculties with the pragmatics of
a task requiring them to address a character in a picture on a computer screen. One
child explicitly asked if we wanted him to talk to the computer, for example. Instead
of wh-questions, they used yes/no questions, or they tried to guess the answer to
the question they were being asked to formulate (see Sukenik, Friedmann, Tuller,
& Morin, 2015).

When appropriate wh-questions were produced, we sought to determine, ﬁrst
of all, if children with ASD avoided complex wh-strategies, in the same way as
children with SLI. We begin with the wh–in situ strategy (e.g., Tu pousses quoi?
“You push what?”), a strategy that entails avoidance of wh-movement. Figure 3
displays the rate of wh–in situ found in the appropriate wh-questions produced by

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5
Prévost et al.: French wh-questions by children with ASD

1106

Figure 3. Elicited production of wh-questions: percentage of questions with wh–in situ. *p <

the different groups. Note that the calculations did not include subject wh-questions
(to which we return below) as these include structures that are ambiguous between
wh–in situ and wh-fronting, since the subject position is sentence initial in French,
the same linear position as that of wh-fronted constituents (e.g., Qui te pousse?
“Who pushes you?”), and wh-questions with pourquoi “why” since it has been
argued that pourquoi is base generated in the fronted position (and thus not subject
to overt wh-movement; Rizzi, 1990).
The difference across groups was signiﬁcant, χ2 (3, N= 69)= 23.312, p < .0001.
As can be seen in Figure 3, the children with ASD, like the children with SLI, used
wh -in situ, the least complex strategy, more frequently than the TD 6-year-olds.
Wh–in situ was found in 31.8% (SD = 38.5) of the appropriate questions produced
by the ASD group and in 62.8% (SD = 34.8) of those produced by the SLI group,
compared to 3% (SD = 10.5) in the TD6 group. The differences between the TD
6-year-olds and the children with ASD and SLI were signiﬁcant, ASD/TD6: U
(31) = 51.5, p = .003, r = –.520; SLI/TD6: U (31) = 11.5, p < .0001, r = –.767.
This suggests that, like the children with SLI, many children with ASD avoided
constructions that entail complex syntactic computation. Although the children
with SLI used wh–in situ questions more frequently than the children with ASD,
the difference between the two groups was not signiﬁcant, after corrections for
multiple comparisons were applied, U (39) = 114.5, p = .02, r = –.367. The
children with ASD seemed to behave similarly to the TD4 group, who produced
25.9% (SD = 37.5) of questions with wh–in situ; the difference between the two
groups was not statistically signiﬁcant, U (36) = 149.5, p = .520. In contrast,
the children with SLI seemed to avoid constructions that entail complex syntactic
computation even more often than the TD4 group, U (36) = 72, p = .003, r =
–.493. These tendencies were maintained when comparing the performance of
children of the HFA-LI subgroup (M = 36.9%, SD = 42.8) to that of the matched
children with SLI (M = 66.9%, SD = 37.4), although the difference was not
statistically signiﬁcant, presumably due to the small size of the samples, U (15) =
22, p= .293. It is also worth mentioning that no signiﬁcant correlations were found

between nonverbal ability and percentage of questions with wh–in situ in the ASD
group (rs = .256, p = .276, df = 19). Finally, since the wh-questions investigated in
the comprehension probe all targeted animate objects, we also looked at the rate of
wh–in situ in qui “who” object questions produced by the children (e.g., Il pousse
qui? “He pushes who?”). The same tendencies reported above were observed.

Another way of determining whether the children with ASD resembled the
children with SLI in avoiding complex wh- production strategies was to see if
they avoided the most complex of the fronting strategies in questions produced
with wh-fronting, that involving wh-fronting and subject/verb inversion. This was
the case, as is seen in Figure 4, which displays the incidence of the different wh-
fronting strategies with respect to the total of questions produced with wh-fronting
(excluding subject questions, since these may be produced with structures that
are ambiguous as to whether wh-fronting has occurred or not, and why-questions,
because why occurs only clause initially). Signiﬁcant differences were found across
groups, χ2 (3, N = 69) = 28.055, p < .0001. Both groups of atypically developing
children produced signiﬁcantly fewer questions with wh-fronting + subject/verb
inversion (e.g., Qui pousses-tu? “Who do you push?”) than the TD 6-year-olds.
Subject/verb inversion was found in 2.4% of all wh-fronted questions produced
by the children with ASD (SD = 10.8) and in 1.1% (SD = 3.4) of those produced
by the children with SLI, compared with 22.2% (SD = 27.5) in the TD6 group,
ASD/TD6: U (31) = 49, p < .0001, r = –.616; SLI/TD6: U (31) = 48, p = .001,
r = –.603. Very few children in the ASD and SLI groups produced wh-questions
with subject/verb inversion, including 1 child with ASD (a high-functioning child
with no language impairment) and 2 children with SLI, versus 8 (out of 12) in the
TD6 group. The children with ASD and those with SLI were more comparable to
the TD 4-year-olds, who did not produce any questions with subject/verb inversion
at all. No signiﬁcant differences were found between the ASD and SLI groups, U
(39) = 191, p = .594.

The children in the ASD and SLI groups not only avoided the most complex
fronting strategy but also mainly used the least complex strategy, plain wh-fronting

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5

1108

(e.g., Où tu caches les bonbons? “Where you hide the candy?”), as did the TD chil-
dren. The difference across groups was signiﬁcant, χ2 (3, N= 69)= 11.1, p= .011,
which was due to a difference between the SLI and TD6 groups, U (31) = 27.5,
p < .0001, r = –.642. The rate of plain wh-fronting in the ASD group did not
differ signiﬁcantly from that of the TD groups, ASD/TD4: U (36) = 92.5, p =
.092; ASD/TD6: U (31) = 90, p = .616. However, the children with ASD pro-
duced less plain wh-fronting (M = 58.6%, SD = 39.7) than the SLI group (M =
87.6%, SD = 15.5), although the difference was not signiﬁcant, U (39) = 132,
p = .068. Whereas the children with SLI used plain wh-fronting far more fre-
quently than any other fronting strategy, the children with ASD produced wh-
questions with ESK (e.g., Comment est-ce que tu mélanges la pâte? “How ESK
you mix the batter?”) relatively often (M = 31.2%, SD = 37.5), and to a signif-
icantly larger extent than the children with SLI (M = 4%, SD = 8.9), U (39) =
110, p = .006, r = –.435. In this respect, the children with ASD behaved similarly
to the TD 4-year-olds (M = 19.8%, SD = 22.2); U (36) = 151.5, p = .560, and
the TD 6-year-olds (M = 18.5%, SD = 14.3); U (31) = 116, p = .874. In contrast,
the differences between the children with SLI and the TD children on use of ESK
were signiﬁcant, SLI/TD4: U (36) = 97, p = .011, r = –.419; SLI/TD6: U (31) =
44.5, p = .001, r = –.573.

The children with ASD, then, did not seem to favor exactly the same strategies
as the children with SLI. This apparent difference is due to their high use of the
ESK strategy. The status of this strategy for many of the questions produced by
the children with ASD, however, may have been the result of adoption of a single,
rigid wh-strategy, applied over and over again. Out of the 12 children with ASD
who produced ESK questions, 7 of these children did so in over 50% of their
questions with wh-fronting, and only in a ﬁxed form qu’est-ce que “what+ESK,”
which they generalized to all of their wh-questions. For example, AUJ (age 9;2)
used qu’est-ce que in all of his wh-questions, except for 4, without distinguishing
between different wh-words, as shown in (3). In some cases, the wh-questions
that he produced were (fortuitously) appropriate (10/50 questions produced with
qu’est-ce que), as in (3a), but most of the time (37/50) they were not, as in (3b). With
adjunct questions, use of qu’est-ce que was both inappropriate and ungrammatical,
as in (3c).

It would seem therefore plausible that for at least some of the children with ASD
qu’est-ce que was used as a kind of unanalyzed wh-form and thus that their ESK
questions did not constitute evidence for greater complexity than that involved in

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5
Prévost et al.: French wh-questions by children with ASD

1109

wh-questions with plain wh-fronting. The high rate of ESK is furthermore likely
to be a reﬂection of perseveration, which was observed for several of the children
with ASD in this task (see Sukenik et al., 2015). We also note that perseveration
of “qu’est-ce que,” which involves wh-fronting, had a mechanical consequence on
the lower rate of wh–in situ in the ASD group when compared to the SLI group
(see above).

Finally, production of clefted wh-questions (e.g., C’est qui que tu pousses? “It
is who that you push?”) did not yield any signiﬁcant difference across groups, χ2
(3, N = 69) = 3.555, p = .314. In the ASD and SLI groups, these constructions
were used less often than wh-questions with plain wh-fronting, but more often than
wh-fronting with subject/verb inversion (ASD: M = 7.8%, SD = 22.6; SLI: M =
7.3%, SD = 11.7), which matches the predictions of the computational complexity
hypothesis since clefting is more complex than plain-fronting but less complex
than wh-fronting with subject/verb inversion. Likewise, in the TD4 group, clefting
(M = 6.1%, SD = 15.1) was less frequently produced than plain wh-fronting
(M = 74.1%, SD = 23.6), but more frequently than wh-fronting with subject/verb
inversion (M = 0%), whereas, for the older TD6 children, the rate of clefting
(M = 3.6%, SD = 8) was lower than that of subject/verb inversion (M = 22.2%,
SD = 27.5).

With respect to the six children with ASD and no severe impairment on the
standardized language tests, we found that two of them used plain wh-fronting in
almost all of their questions involving wh-movement (at least 75%), whereas for
the four others the rate of plain wh-fronting was below 40%. It was interesting
that this group of six children included the only child with ASD who produced
wh-questions with subject/verb inversion (KIH, age 10;5), and most of these chil-
dren (ﬁve/six) did not make frequent use of wh-fronting + ESK (less than 30%
of the time), compared to six children in the rest of the children with ASD for
whom wh-fronting + ESK represented at least 80% of their questions with wh-
movement (half with normal nonverbal ability). This suggests that the children
with ASD and no severe language impairment tended to perseverate with qu’est-
ce que? less than the other children. Finally, in the ASD group, no signiﬁcant
correlations were found between nonverbal ability and use of plain wh-fronting
(rs = –.073, p = .760), wh-fronting + ESK (rs = .131, p = .583), and clefting
(rs = .082, p = .732) (all dfs = 19). Note that correlations were not calculated with
wh-fronting and subject/verb inversion as this strategy was produced by only one
child.

Did the production of subject wh-questions follow the same trends just reported
for object and adjunct questions, with the ASD group generally resembling the SLI
group in displaying avoidance of the most complex wh- strategies, and high rates for
the least complex strategies? Four different strategies were used by children in the
production of subject wh-questions (see Figure 5): those structurally ambiguous
between plain wh-fronting and wh–in situ (e.g., Qui te mord? “Who bites you?”),
and questions with wh-fronting + ESK (e.g., Qui est-ce qui te mord? “Who is it
that bites you?”), with wh-fronting + c’est (e.g., Qui c’est qui te mord? “Who
it is that bites you?”), and with clefting (e.g., C’est qui qui te mord? “It is who
that bites you?”).10 The ﬁrst type of questions is the least complex since these
questions involve either a subject wh-phrase in situ or a plain-fronted subject

1110

groups.

wh-phrase, whereas the other types of questions involve at least an additional
operation besides wh-fronting.
Signiﬁcant group differences were found for subject wh-questions structurally
ambiguous between wh–in situ and wh-fronting, χ2 (3, N = 69) = 8.945, p = .030,
and clefts, χ2 (3, N= 69)= 12.120, p= .007, but not for questions with ESK, χ2 (3,
N = 69) = 5.767, p = .124. As shown in Figure 5, structurally ambiguous subject
wh-questions were used to a greater extent (M = 56.9%, SD = 47.2) than other
subject questions by the children with ASD, in particular wh-fronting + ESK (M =
23%, SD = 41.7) and clefts (M = 16.8%, SD = 33.9). This trend was observed in
all of the children with ASD, including the six children who did not display severe
impairment on the standardized language tests. The children with SLI also used
structurally ambiguous wh-questions most of the time (M = 49.2%, SD = 41.6), at
about the same rate as the children with ASD, U (39) = 150.5, p = .538. Clefting
was, however, more frequent in the SLI group (M = 46.4%, SD = 40.7) than in the
ASD group, U (39) = 90, p = .010, r = –.423. However, the clefts produced by
the children with SLI were largely ungrammatical, and their syntax was probably
more akin to the syntax of wh–in situ, the least complex strategy. Wh-fronting +
ESK was again less frequent in the SLI group (SLI: M = 0.5%, SD = 2). Only
one child with SLI produced any such subject questions (representing 9.1% of the
total of his subject questions), whereas ﬁve children with ASD did, and four of
them repeatedly (at least 80% of their subject questions). These same children,
three of them HF, also used wh-fronting + ESK in all of their object questions,
lending support to the hypothesis these high rates are due to perseveration of this
strategy. Note that the differences between the ASD and SLI groups on subject
wh-questions displaying ESK or clefting held when comparing the HFA-LI group
and their matched group of children with SLI.

No signiﬁcant differences were found between the children with ASD and the
TD children with respect to subject questions syntactically ambiguous between
wh–in situ and plain wh-fronting, and clefts; however, signiﬁcant differences arose
when the children with SLI and the TD6 children were compared, syntactically
ambiguous questions: U (31) = 45.5, p = .002, r = –.545; clefts: U (31) = 45,
p = .002 r = –.554.

Figure 6. Elicited production of wh-questions: mean percentage of erroneous wh-questions.
*p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001.

Finally, no signiﬁcant correlations were found between nonverbal ability and
the production of the different subject wh-questions in the ASD group (structurally
ambiguous questions: rs = –.282, p = .272, df = 19; wh-fronting + ESK: rs =
.425, p = .089, df = 19; clefts: rs = –.278, p = .280, df = 19).

Error analysis. Figure 6 reports, for each group, the percentage of appropriate
wh-questions produced in each group that contained at least one error. Signiﬁcant
differences were found across groups, χ2 (3, N = 69) = 31.227, p < .0001. As can
be seen in Figure 6, the rate of erroneous questions found in the ASD group (M =
17.3%, SD = 16.2) was signiﬁcantly higher than in the two younger TD groups,
TD4: M = 6.1%, SD = 7.1; U (36) = 87, p = .011, r = –.418; TD6: M = 1.2%,
SD = 2; U (31) = 18, p < .0001, r = –.711. The same pattern was observed in the
children with SLI, whose mean rate of erroneous wh-questions was 35.2% (SD =
31.2), SLI/TD4: U (36) = 60.5, p = .001, r = –.551; SLI/TD6: U (31) = 14.5, p <
.0001, r = –.737.11 The incidence of errors was higher in the SLI group than in the
ASD group, although the difference was not signiﬁcant, U (39) = 138.5, p = .096.
As expected, the 6 children with ASD who did not display severe impairment on the
standardized language tests produced very few errors in their wh-questions; their
rate of erroneous questions was 6.2% (SD = 5.3), compared to 22% (SD = 17.1)
for the 14 other children with ASD. Eight of these other children, who formed
the HFA-LI subgroup, had a comparable rate of erroneous wh-questions as the
matched SLI subgroup (25.4% versus 32.4% respectively); U (15) = 28.5, p =
.713. Finally, no signiﬁcant correlations were found between nonverbal ability and
the percentage of erroneous questions produced by the children with ASD (rs =
.089, p = .709, df = 19).
Were the error types found in the children with ASD similar to those found in
the SLI group? The same error types were found in each of the groups: errors on
the wh-word, on the subject, on the object, on the verb, and on the complementizer
(C). However, the frequency of these error types was quite different, as can be seen

these errors represent based on the total number of errors for each group.

Errors on wh-words were the most frequent error type observed in the children
with ASD; they were much less frequent in the SLI group. It was argued in the
previous section that in the children with ASD, many of these may be due to
perseveration: some children with ASD started using a wh-word in one question,
and kept using the same wh-word in the questions that followed (see (3) above).
There were also ﬁve instances of fronted quoi “what” (four in the same child,
ARE), which is ungrammatical in French and likely to be a result of repetition of
the task stimulus, which contained the target wh-word as an object (“The woman
is washing something, but we can’t see what”).12 This is illustrated in (4).

ARE:

Neither of these types of perseveration/repetition errors was found in the SLI group.
Complementizer errors, in contrast, were very frequent in the SLI group, but
rare in the ASD group. These errors, illustrated in (5), occurred when children
appeared to have attempted production of a subject cleft question, and omitted C
or substituted it with a central vowel, a so-called protoform. Clefts were rare in
the ASD group, and hence the opportunity to make C errors was rare as well.

Two other errors were frequent in the SLI group, but not in the ASD group: errors
on the subject and errors on the verb. The former, like the C errors, consisted of
either omission or substitution of the subject clitic by a protoform, as illustrated

in (6). Errors on the verb were mostly due to use of inﬁnitival morphology, as in
(7). Restricted to a subset of the most severely impaired children with SLI (e.g.,
three children with SLI omitted the subject and used inﬁnitival forms in over 30%
of their wh-questions), the rarity of these two error types in the children with ASD
suggests that language impairment in this group was less severe (e.g., no child
with ASD used protoforms).

were most notably due to object omission, as in (8).

(SLI, 9;1)

Errors on objects also included three errors committed by the children with ASD
in which an object trace was lexicalized. In other words, in addition to the object
wh-word, an object was found to occur after the verb, in the form of a quantiﬁer
(quelque chose “something” or quelqu’un “someone”), as illustrated in (9).

This error may again be due to repetition of part of the stimulus by these children
with ASD (e.g., Le lapin pousse quelqu’un mais on ne voit pas qui “The rabbit is
pushing someone but we can’t see who”). Such errors were not found in the other
groups.

An error on objects that was largely restricted to the SLI group, and that was rel-
atively frequent, involved the substitution of an object clitic with a strong pronoun
(28/94 = 29.8%, vs. 2/22 = 9.1% for the children with ASD). These occurred
in subject wh-questions in which the second person singular clitic te “you” was
expected (e.g., Qui te mord? “Who bites you?”). Instead, the corresponding strong
pronoun toi was produced, as shown in (10). In the same context, the children with
ASD omitted the object, as shown in (11).

Although morphosyntactic errors were less frequent in the ASD group, it should
be pointed out that when they occurred, they tended to be found in the subset of
children with LI. In particular, four children in the HFA-LI subgroup produced
subject omission, object omission, and root inﬁnitives in over 10% of their wh-
questions, versus none in the subgroup of ﬁve children with HFA and no language
impairment.

Finally, we compared error rates on the production of wh-questions with two
measures of morphosyntactic development: mean length of utterance (MLU) and
the standardized measure of morphosyntax (sentence completion). Signiﬁcant neg-
ative correlations were found between the number of erroneous wh-questions and
the standardized score for morphosyntax in the ASD group (rs = –.512, p = .021,
df = 19) and MLU in the SLI group (rs = –.725, p < .0001, df = 19).

Discussion

The children with ASD tended, like the children with SLI, to use questions with
wh–in situ, which corresponds to the least complex structure, signiﬁcantly more
often than the TD 6-year-olds (see Jakubowicz, 2005; Jakubowicz & Tuller, 2008;
Zebib et al., 2013). With questions entailing wh-fronting, both the ASD group
and the SLI group favored plain wh-fronting over more complex structures. In
particular, they produced signiﬁcantly fewer questions with subject/verb inversion,
the most complex structure, compared to the TD 6-year-olds. In other words, the
children with ASD and the children with SLI, whose mean age was 8;7, used
computationally less complex derivations signiﬁcantly more often than younger
TD6 children.

The tendency to avoid computational complexity was found more frequently in
the children with SLI than in the children with ASD. We suggest that this result
is due to more generalized difﬁculties in the SLI group, whereas the ASD group
is more heterogeneous, which is reﬂected by the fact that while all the children
with SLI produced at least one wh-question with wh–in situ, only 13 children
with ASD (out of 20) used this strategy. This nonetheless suggests that a large
proportion of the ASD group behaved similarly to the children with SLI. Most
ASD-SLI differences, in both frequency of particular wh-strategies deployed and
error types, were due to behaviors having to do with perseveration of a speciﬁc
wh-word/strategy (e.g., wh-fronting + ESK) or repetition of the task stimulus for
eliciting wh-question production (ungrammatical fronting of object “what” and
ﬁlled object gaps) on the part of the children with ASD. Other differences were
found with respect to morphosyntactic errors, in particular a more frequent rate
of complementizer omission and nonﬁnite verbs in the SLI group than in the
ASD group. Some of these errors would appear to be manifestations of severely
immature syntax (subject omission, complementizer omission, use of protoforms,
and use of inﬁnitival verb forms in place of a ﬁnite verb) on the part of a few
children with SLI. It is not at all clear, however, that these errors are indicative of
fundamental differences between the two groups. First, complementizer omission
was observed in clefted wh-questions, and these were mainly produced by the
children with SLI, thus preventing any direct comparisons between the two groups
about use of complementizers. Second, analysis of spontaneous production on
a subgroup of 17 children with ASD and 18 children with SLI did not reveal

any notable differences for errors on verb inﬂectional morphology, including root
inﬁnitives (Morin, 2011).

Finally, no signiﬁcant correlations were observed in the ASD group between
nonverbal ability and any measures of production taken from this task, including
number of expected wh-questions, rate of the different wh-strategies, and rate of
erroneous questions. This echoes the lack of correlations found between RPM
scores and performance on the three standardized tasks (receptive vocabulary,
morphosyntax, and phonology).

EXPERIMENT 2: COMPREHENSION OF WH-QUESTIONS

Method

In the comprehension task, there were 72 pictures each displaying three characters
who were performing the same action on each other. One of the characters appeared
in the middle, one was located on its right, and one on its left, as shown in Figure 7.
For each picture, a subject or object wh-question was asked about the central
character, targeting one of the two other characters (e.g., “Look here! There’s a cat,
a penguin, and a rabbit. Tell me: Who is the penguin pushing?”). The participants
were invited to answer the question by pointing to the appropriate character. All
question words were animate (with the wh-word qui “who”).

There were 48 object questions, 12 with wh–in situ (e.g., Le pingouin pousse qui?
“The penguin pushes who[m]?”), 12 with plain wh-fronting (e.g., Qui le pingouin
pousse? “Who[m] is the penguin pushing?”), 12 with wh-fronting and ESK (e.g.,
Qui est-ce que le pingouin pousse? “Who[m] is the penguin pushing?”), and 12 with
wh-fronting, ESK, and stylistic inversion (e.g., Qui est-ce que pousse le pingouin?
“Who[m] ESK pushes the penguin?”). The latter construction was deemed the most
complex. There were also 24 subject questions: 12 were ambiguous between wh–in
situ and wh-fronting (e.g., Qui pousse le pingouin? “Who pushes the penguin?”)
and 12 displayed wh-fronting and ESK (e.g., Qui est-ce qui pousse le pingouin?
“Who ESK pushes the penguin?”). The different question types were presented in
(pseudo)randomized order.

Results

In the comprehension task, as we have seen, the non-wh-word in the question
was always represented by the central character in the picture, and the picture in

Figure 8. Comprehension of object wh-questions.

Figure 7 was used to test comprehension of questions such as “Who is the penguin
pushing?” as well as “Who is pushing the penguin?” Notice that selection of the
central character amounted to the child interpreting the question as a reﬂexive.
Children in all groups only very rarely gave such answers (less than 1.5% of
all answers, in each group). In other words, children interpreted the questions
in this task as either (nonreﬂexive) subject wh-questions or object wh-questions,
a binary choice. Accordingly, we analyzed each child’s performance for chance,
using the results of a binomial test based on a binary choice. This analysis revealed
that one of the children with ASD and one of the children in the TD4 group
performed at chance on every question type (between 4 and 8 correct responses
out of the 12 possible items), and thus it was impossible to conclude anything about
their ability to comprehend the different wh-strategies tested. These children were
therefore excluded from any further analyses of the wh-question comprehension
task. None of the children with SLI or those in the TD6 group had uniformly
chance performance.

Beginning with the proportion of correct responses for comprehension of object
wh-questions, presented in Figure 8, the children in all four groups performed
very well on questions involving wh–in situ (e.g., Le pingouin pousse qui? “The
penguin pushes who?”), plain wh-fronting (e.g., Qui le pingouin pousse? “Who
the penguin pushes?”), and wh-fronting with ESK (e.g., Qui est-ce que le pingouin
pousse? “Who ESK the penguin pushes?”) strategies. No signiﬁcant differences
were observed between the different groups for any of these types of object wh-
questions.13 Performance was signiﬁcantly worse, in each group, on the most
complex type, namely, questions whose derivation involves wh-fronting, ESK, and
stylistic inversion (e.g., Qui est-ce que pousse le pingouin? “Who ESK ﬁlms the
penguin?”); a Kruskal–Wallis test, corrected for tied ranks, showed no signiﬁcant
group effect on comprehension accuracy on these questions, χ2 (3, N = 66) =
4.048, p = .256. As can be seen in Figure 9, most children in the SLI, TD4, and
TD6 groups displayed performance either at chance or below chance on these
items (16 out of the 20 children with SLI, 15/16 TD4, and 8/12 TD6). However,
while the proportions in the SLI group appear to resemble most closely those in the
TD4 group, in the ASD group, about half of the children (9/19) displayed above

chance performance (3 of them LF); we return to this result below in relation to
the relatively poor results on subject questions found in the ASD group.

In addition, there was no signiﬁcant negative correlation between the production
of wh-questions with wh–in situ and the comprehension of object wh-questions
with wh-fronting. In other words, there was no relationship between the ten-
dency to use the wh–in situ strategy, the least complex, in production, and dif-
ﬁculties in understanding wh-questions that did not use this strategy (but rather
wh-fronting), in either the ASD group or the SLI group. While many children in
the SLI group (16/20) and the ASD group only rarely (or never) used the wh-
fronting + ESK strategy in production (i.e., in less than 10% of the wh-questions
displaying wh-fronting), comprehension of this construction was basically at
ceiling.
With respect to subject wh-questions, group differences were found on struc-
turally ambiguous constructions, χ2 (3, N = 66) = 8.389, p = .039, but not on
questions with ESK, χ2 (3, N = 66) = 4.43, p = .070. Figure 10 shows that the
children with ASD scored lower than the TD6 children on both ambiguous wh–
in situ/wh-fronting questions (ASD: 70.2% vs. TD6: 95.6%); U (30) = 52, p =
.009, r = –.468, and wh-fronting + ESK (ASD: 70.1% vs. TD6: 94.4%). No

signiﬁcant differences were found on structurally ambiguous subject questions
between the children with SLI and the TD 6-year-olds following corrections for
multiple comparisons, U (30) = 61.5, p = .026, and between the SLI and ASD
groups, U (37) = 158, p = .504. There were likewise no signiﬁcant differences
between the accuracy rates on the two subject wh-question types, in any group.

As reported above, children almost never selected the central character in the
comprehension task (the ungrammatical reﬂexive interpretation), and thus error
analysis on subject wh-questions revealed that almost every time children gave an
erroneous answer, they pointed to the character corresponding to the object of the
verb. We believe that these errors could be due to a perseveration strategy adopted
by some children in this task. As the task involved a large majority of object wh-
questions (48/72), the children with ASD may have surmised that the task involved
asking questions about the character toward whom the action was directed by the
character located in the middle. This strategy also entails the fact reported above
that these children had relatively high performance on the most difﬁcult object wh-
questions (wh-fronting + ESK + stylistic inversion). This pattern is particularly
visible in four children with ASD, whose comprehension scores are given in Table 3
(WAE, LUJ, MAM, and ROD), who were below (<26%) or at chance for subject
questions, and well above chance (>74%) for all object questions, including those
with stylistic inversion. Only one child with SLI displayed this pattern (THB). In
the TD groups, all children displayed above chance performance on both types
of subject questions, except for two TD4 children who performed at chance on
structurally ambiguous questions.

Finally, correlation analyses, reported in Table 4, revealed that nonverbal ability
was not signiﬁcantly correlated with measures from the wh-question comprehen-
sion task in the ASD group, including those involving the most complex deriva-
tions.

Discussion

The comprehension task results point to overall similarities in performance be-
tween the children with ASD and the children with SLI. Both groups had ceiling
performance on the same object wh-questions, those involving wh–in situ, plain
wh-fronting, and wh-fronting + ESK. These results show clearly that the children
had no difﬁculties understanding object wh-questions involving a certain degree
of complexity, including wh-fronting and ESK insertion. Both groups of children
displayed poorer performance on the most complex wh-constructions (with wh-
fronting, stylistic inversion, and ESK). These constructions were also problematic
for the TD children. This illustrates that when complexity is very high, compre-
hension may also be affected, not only in populations with pathology, but also in
TD children.

Some differences were also found between the ASD group and the SLI group
that concerned comprehension of subject wh-questions. Accuracy was lower in
the children with ASD than in the children with SLI, which we have argued could
be due to a perseveration strategy on the part of some children with ASD to point
to the character corresponding to the object of the verb, a strategy that also ac-
counts for the extremely high scores in these same children for comprehension
of the most difﬁcult object wh-questions. Alternatively, or perhaps in addition,
the object interpretation could be taken to be evidence for rigid adherence to
information structure considerations on the part of children with ASD, as the
direct object is the canonical position for new information (and hence the wh-
phrase) and the subject, particularly in a language like French, is almost exclu-
sively reserved for old information. Clefting, which highlights new information,
provides subjects with structural salience that they would not have in situ. Children
with SLI used this strategy in subject questions far more often than children with
ASD.

One of our goals in looking at comprehension in children with ASD was to see
whether nonverbal ability in these children was linked to comprehension perfor-
mance, which, if so, would provide support for the assumption that children with
low nonverbal reasoning might have more difﬁculty with comprehension than
children with unimpaired nonverbal reasoning. No support for such a relationship

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5
Prévost et al.: French wh-questions by children with ASD

1120

was found for any of the wh-structures tested in the comprehension task, and in
particular not for the structure that was computationally the most complex. This
result suggests that comprehension of complex syntax may not be related to non-
verbal reasoning in verbal children with ASD.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING DISCUSSION

The overall objective of this study was to examine the structural language of
children with ASD, in both production and comprehension, and to explore the
nature of potential similarities/differences between language performance in ASD
and in SLI. Seeking to contribute to knowledge of language proﬁles in children with
ASD, formal aspects of language were analyzed in a group of 20 verbal school-
age children with ASD, which included children with and without intellectual
disability, through comparison with a group of 20 age-matched children with SLI.
On baseline language measures, a large proportion of children in both groups
scored substantially below norms in phonology and morphosyntax. All of the
children with SLI scored below the 5th percentile (–1.65 SD) on one or both
of these tests, whereas 6 children with ASD were above this threshold on both
(and on receptive vocabulary), and thus the children with ASD included children
with seemingly impaired structural language and children with seemingly normal
structural language.

Children in the ASD and SLI groups (and TD controls of the same age as the
youngest children in the two clinical groups, and younger TD controls aged 4) were
administered two tasks designed to examine the effects of the computational com-
plexity entailed in the production and comprehension of wh-questions in French,
which encompass a wide variety of syntactic strategies ranging in complexity as
measured by the number of internal and external merge operations involved in their
derivation. We sought, ﬁrst of all, to see whether children with ASD resembled
children with SLI in avoiding the more complex strategies and thus favoring in
the production task those strategies that were the simplest. Overall, this was the
case. Children in both groups tended to more often use the least complex strate-
gies, wh–in situ, and avoid the most complex strategy, wh-fronting + subject/verb
inversion, than younger TD children aged 6. This result is consonant with Riches
et al.’s (2010) ﬁnding that syntactic complexity affected in similar ways children
with ASD-LI and children with SLI, though they also found that difﬁculties were
greater in the SLI group compared with the ASD group, which they interpreted as
a contradiction for the claim that there may be strong phenotypic overlap between
the two. Some differences were also found between the ASD and SLI groups we
studied, with respect to use of some types of wh-questions, in particular a larger
use of wh-fronting + ESK by the children with ASD; we return to these dif-
ferences below, arguing for a different conclusion from that put forth by Riches
et al.

Our objective in focusing on wh-questions in French was to explore the ques-
tion of relative performance on production versus comprehension from the angle
of computational complexity in syntax. It has often been held that one of the

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5
Prévost et al.: French wh-questions by children with ASD

1121

notable features of language in ASD, and one that putatively distinguishes lan-
guage impairment in these children from that in children with SLI, is that reception
is comparatively more impaired than production. Thorough cross-study compari-
son (Kwok et al., 2015) has shown that this has not been established, at least for
vocabulary and composite language measures, and for structural language, studies
were too sparse to draw any conclusions. We did not uncover any evidence for
an expression-over-reception bias, or a weak reception bias, in syntax in children
with ASD. Accuracy in understanding most object wh-questions was very high
(over 90%), including object wh-questions involving some degree of complexity,
such as wh-fronting and ESK. Accuracy was found to decline when complexity
was the highest, for most children. However, this was also the case for most chil-
dren in each of the other groups, and the children with SLI. This decline cannot
therefore be attributed to general failure, on the part of children with ASD, to
understand what they were told. This shows that like production, comprehension
may be affected by computational complexity. The difference between production
and comprehension regarding the effect of complexity is that in comprehension, a
higher level of complexity may be necessary before a breakdown is observed (and
thus, as we found, plain wh-fronting and wh-fronting with ESK were equally well
understood, but the former was produced much more frequently than the latter),
while avoidance of complexity may be found in production with less complex
structures as production involves not only the grammatical mechanisms necessary
for the building of sentences but also other factors such as articulatory planning
and coordination, which are not involved in comprehension (Lobley, Baddeley,
& Gathercole, 2005). The children with ASD, overall, did not behave any differ-
ently from the children in the other groups in this regard. For some children with
ASD, however, difﬁculties also arose in comprehension of subject wh-questions,
but, as seen above, this may be due to a tendency to perseverate in the kinds of
answers given, rather than to a deﬁcit in receptive syntax. If it were a deﬁcit in
receptive syntax, these children should have had difﬁculties on all wh-questions
types, and certainly not just subject questions, which are clearly syntactically the
simplest.

Our third research question was whether language performance, and compre-
hension in particular, is related to nonverbal ability in children with ASD. This is
a fundamental part of the wider question of the nature and prevalence of different
language proﬁles in ASD. Are there children who, like children with SLI, have
language impairment and normal nonverbal ability (Eigsti et al., 2007; Kjelgaard
& Tager-Flusberg, 2001), or is language impairment in ASD dependent on gen-
eral cognitive ability (Howlin, 2003; Tager-Flusberg et al., 1990)? We reasoned
that any effects of low nonverbal ability ought to be visible in the most complex
formal aspects of language, if it is true that low nonverbal ability can be a cause of
structural language impairment. The results revealed that language performance
in the children with ASD was not related to their nonverbal ability as measured
via Raven’s Progressive Matrices (for which midpoint percentile scores ranged
from 2.5 to 92.5, as shown in Table 1 above). This was true for performance on
elicited production of wh-questions, and thus whether children favored more or
less complex wh-strategies in producing wh-questions did not depend on their

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5
Prévost et al.: French wh-questions by children with ASD

1122

nonverbal ability. This was also true for comprehension of wh-questions, includ-
ing the most complex strategy tested. This result suggests that nonverbal reasoning
is not related to (at least these manifestations of) formal language impairment in
children with ASD, and more speciﬁcally, that performance on these measures of
complex language does not appear to depend on nonverbal level in verbal children
with ASD, even in comprehension. In short, our results support the hypothesis of
a “speciﬁc” language disorder in children with ASD, one that can occur indepen-
dently of nonverbal ability. More generally, this conclusion was also supported
by performance on standardized language measures (see Appendix A). Perovic
et al. (2013b) reached the same conclusion, through comparison of an ASD-LI
group including children both with and without intellectual disability not only to
a group with ASD and normal language but also to mental-age-matched children
with William syndrome and to TD children matched in raw scores for nonverbal
reasoning: the children in the ﬁrst group all displayed impairment not found in the
other three groups.

However, it is important to emphasize the need for investigation of the intersect-
ing relationships between structural language impairment and nonverbal ability in
ASD through studies of four groups with adequate numbers of verbal children
with ASD: (a) children with normal language and normal nonverbal ability, (b)
children with normal language and impaired nonverbal ability, (c) children with
LI and normal nonverbal ability, and (d) children with LI and impaired nonverbal
ability. We have explored language in a group of children with ASD that did not
exclude any of these categories, but each of them was not equally represented.14
The relative prevalence of these proﬁles constitutes an empirical question that re-
mains to be explored. While our results support the ﬁnding that language proﬁles
may vary in ASD, independently of nonverbal ability, and that one of these proﬁles
appears to coincide with the SLI proﬁle (language impairment in the absence of
impaired nonverbal IQ), it is premature to conclude that children with this latter
proﬁle have comorbid ASD and SLI.

Alongside the overwhelming similarities in structural language performance
displayed by the ASD group and the SLI group, it must be emphasized that rather
striking, recurring differences were also found between the two groups. The chil-
dren with ASD produced inappropriate answers more frequently than the children
with SLI did on the wh-question production task. Moreover, when they did produce
wh-questions, wh-strategy frequency and error patterns were sometimes affected by
perseveration. Thus, wh-fronting with ESK was found in the majority of questions
produced by seven children, sometimes resulting in ungrammatical constructions;
this was not found in children with SLI. Similarly, some ASD-speciﬁc error pat-
terns could be attributed to repetition of parts of the elicitation prompt given by the
experimenter. In comprehension, one child with ASD performed at chance on all
types of wh-questions, whereas no child with SLI did. Four children with ASD in-
terpreted nearly all wh-questions as object questions, which resulted in low scores
for subject wh-questions and surprisingly high scores for the object wh-questions
that caused difﬁculties for nearly all children, in all groups (only one child with SLI
displayed this behavior). As there were twice as many object wh-questions than
subject wh-questions in the task, these children may have generalized the former
to the latter, displaying perseveration, once again. Using an experimental task with

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5

a balanced number of subject and object wh-questions would help us conﬁrm this
hypothesis (in which case a bias for object wh-questions would not be expected),
or, should the bias for object wh-questions persist, it would be indicative that chil-
dren with ASD tend to rely on information structure considerations, as suggested
above.

Taken together, these differences between the children with ASD compared to
the children with SLI seem to point in the same direction, namely, that difﬁcul-
ties in appropriate use of language in context, pragmatics, may have an effect
on performance on tasks designed to assess structural language, and may par-
tially obscure fundamental similarities in the structural language difﬁculties in
the two populations. These difﬁculties also raise the complementary question of
the extent to which low structural language performance could be the result of
pragmatic difﬁculties, in some children with ASD. Disentangling these factors
could proﬁtably be explored through studies based on both focused measures
of structural language (including eye tracking and other online processing tech-
niques (see Léger, Prévost, & Tuller, 2015) and thorough assessment of aspects of
pragmatics.

aPercentile ranges were converted into midpoint percentiles, as suggested by Botting and
Conti-Ramsden (2008).
bLanguage was assessed on the basis of performance on three standardized tests focusing
on receptive vocabulary (Bilan informatisé de langage oral au Cycle III et au collège,
Khomsi et al., 2007), morphosyntax (sentence completion, Bilan informatisé de langage
oral au Cycle III et au collège), and receptive vocabulary (Batterie d’évaluation du langage
oral de l’enfant aphasique, De Agostini et al., 1998). Children performing below –1.65 SD
in morphosyntax and/or phonology were considered to be language impaired. Note that
one child with ASD did not take the vocabulary task.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This research was supported by French National Research Agency Grant BLAN-0328-
01. We are grateful to the clinicians at autism centers at university teaching hospitals in
Tours and in Brest: C. Barthe´le ´my, M. Bataille, P. Dansart, E. Lemonnier, and J. Rozec. The
comparison with SLI was possible thanks to E. Sizaret and A.-G. Piller, and A. Galloux at the
Language Reference Center of the Children’s Hospital in Tours. We also thank the students
and postdoctoral researchers involved in this study: S. Gale`s, E. Morin, M. Scheidnes, and
R. Zebib.

NOTES
1.

SLI does not appear in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Instead,
different types of disorders are mentioned, that is, language disorder (F80.9), speech
sound disorder (F80.0), and social (pragmatic) communication disorder (F80.89),
accompanied by the usual exclusionary criteria (for a recent discussion, see Rice,
2016). For ease of exposition, and in order to facilitate references and comparisons
with previous research, we will continue using SLI in this paper.

2. The syntax of wh-questions in French is subject to intense debate among researchers,
regarding the derivation of wh–in situ, which may involve covert or overt movement,
or no movement at all (for an overview, see Cheng, 2009). We follow Jakubowicz’
hypothesis that the computational complexity hypothesis applies to overt movement
(see Prévost et al., in press) and that wh–in situ does not involve overt movement.
The semantics of wh–in situ has also been debated. For some, wh–in situ is restricted
to questions with a strong presupposition (Cheng & Rooryck, 2000; but see Mathieu,
2004). It is important to mention that a strong presuppositional context does not
preclude use of wh-fronting.

3. A more recent account of movement than the one adopted in this paper can be found in
Chomsky (2001, 2008). However, assuming a more traditional approach to syntactic
derivations does not impact on the basic points raised in this paper.

4. Unfortunately, we did not have access to the Autism Diagnosis Interview and Autism

5. Analysis of spontaneous production by 17 of the children we recruited showed that

Diagnostic Observation Schedule scores for all children.
they had MLUs ranging from 3.9 to 9.0 (M = 5.81, SD = 2.9; Morin, 2011).
6. Even though nonverbal IQ scores for the children with ASD were based on different
tasks, a signiﬁcant correlation was nevertheless found with RPM scores (rs = .70;
p < .001, df = 18). Furthermore, basing our search for correlations with language on
RPM (see below) is strongly supported by studies on ASD such as Dawson, Soulières,
Gernsbacher, and Mottron (2007).

8.

7. We note that the four female participants with ASD did not cluster into any one of
these four proﬁles. Regarding gender, we furthermore note that the greater degree of
gender imbalance found in the ASD group compared to the SLI group reﬂects what
is known for these two pathologies; the ASD and SLI groups were thus not matched
for gender.
Spontaneous language samples available for 18 of the children with SLI (Morin,
2011) showed MLUs ranging from 4.03 to 7.92, with a mean of 5.79 (SD = 3.1),
which did not differ signiﬁcantly from that of the children with ASD, U (32) = 198,
p = .968.
Statistical analyses were run using nonparametric tests because nonnormal distribu-
tion of the data was obtained through our measures (Shapiro–Wilk tests). Furthermore,
corrections for multiple comparisons were applied.

9.

11.

10. However, very few questions with wh-fronting with c’est were found: seven in each of
the atypically developing groups, one in the TD4 group, and none in the TD6 group.
We will therefore not report about them any further.
Similar results were found when taking into account the mean number of errors per
question produced. It was signiﬁcantly higher in the ASD (M = 0.19, SD = 0.19) and
SLI (M = 0.54, SD = 0.57) groups compared to the TD4 (M = 0.06, SD = 0.007) and
the TD6 (M = 0.01, SD = 0.02) groups. The difference between the ASD and SLI
groups was not signiﬁcant following corrections for multiple comparisons, U (39) =
126.5, p = .046, r = –.315.
In French, the wh-word “what” appears as que when fronted. The grammatical al-
ternatives to (4) are Qu’est-ce que tu laves (Wh-fronting + ESK) or Que laves-tu
(Wh-fronting + subject/verb inversion). Que tu laves is also ungrammatical, as the
wh-word que is a verbal clitic in French.

12.

13. An anonymous reviewer wondered whether in each case, by hearing le pingouin
pousse __ “The penguin is pushing __,” the children may have associated pingouin to
the agent and choose the other character as the answer, which thus may be unrelated
to complexity issues. While this is possible for wh-questions with wh–in situ, where
the ﬁrst element heard by the children corresponds to the agent, it is a little more
complicated in questions where wh-fronting has applied. In these cases (e.g., Qui le
penguin pousse?), the ﬁrst element heard is an animate wh-word, which the children
may associate with the agent (see Frauenfelder, Segui, & Mehler, 1980). Hearing le
pingouin pousse __ would then force them to reinterpret the role of the ﬁrst element
and look for its base-generated position. It is this reinterpretation process that, by

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5

being intimately related to chain formation (and movement operations), may yield
complexity problems.

14. This was also the case in Perovic et al.’s (2013b) study, which included 21 children in
Category (a), 1 in Category (b), 5 in Category (c), and 21 in Category (d), and Roberts,
Rice, and Tager-Flusberg’s (2004) study, which included 21 children in Category (a),
6 in Category (b), 4 in Category (c), and 15 in Category (d), as well as 13 children
with borderline language, 9 with intellectual disability, and 7 without.
