ABSTRACT
We describe the European Portuguese version of a test of prosodic abilities originally developed for
English: the Proﬁling Elements of Prosody in Speech-Communication (Pepp´e & McCann, 2003).
Using this test, we examined the development of several components of European Portuguese prosody
between 5 and 20 years of age (N = 131). Results showed prosodic performance improving with age:
5-year-olds reach adultlike performance in the affective prosodic tasks; 7-year-olds mastered the ability
to discriminate and produce short prosodic items, as well as the ability to understand question versus
declarative intonation; 8-year-olds mastered the ability to discriminate long prosodic items; 9-year-olds
mastered the ability to produce question versus declarative intonation, as well as the ability to identify
focus; 10- to 11-year-olds mastered the ability to produce long prosodic items; 14- to 15-year-olds
mastered the ability to comprehend and produce syntactically ambiguous utterances disambiguated by
prosody; and 18- to 20-year-olds mastered the ability to produce focus. Cross-linguistic comparisons
showed that linguistic form–meaning relations do not necessarily develop at the same pace across
languages. Some prosodic contrasts are hard to achieve for younger Portuguese-speaking children,
namely, the production of chunking and focus.

Prosody plays an important part in the production and comprehension of the orga-
nization of speech, manifested by patterns of intonation, rhythm, prominence, and
chunking of the speech continuum. Several form–meaning relations are established
or contributed to by prosody, namely, sentence type distinctions, the highlighting

of important information, the demarcation of speech units (also known as phras-
ing), and different kinds of affective meanings (Halliday, 1967; Ladd, 2008). Many
prosodic form–meaning relations convey linguistic meanings, that is, meanings
related to the message, such as interrogativity, ﬁnality, or focus, which may (or not)
be grammaticalized in different languages and in different ways (Gussenhoven,
2002, 2016). For example, interrogativity tends to be signaled by high or rising
pitch, and ﬁnality by low pitch (as in English or Portuguese), but in Swedish a
ﬁnal low tone is used both in statements and questions; focus in West Germanic
languages is typically achieved by the presence of a pitch contour in the promi-
nent element (accentuation) and absence of accentuation on words that follow
the prominent element, whereas other languages may use different types of ac-
cents to contrast focused and unfocused words (such as Portuguese; Frota, 2014).
Other prosodic form–meaning relations express meanings related to the state
of the speaker, such as the affective meanings of (un)happy or (un)cooperative,
which tend to be less arbitrary and thus less language speciﬁc (Gussenhoven,
2016).

Given the broad role played by prosody, it is not surprising that it has taken a
leading role in spoken communication and language development. Prosodic skills
have been shown to be essential for language acquisition, and it is known that
children have the ability to understand differences conveyed by prosodic features
from birth and to use prosody to extract relevant information for lexical and syn-
tactic analysis early in development (e.g., Gervain & Mehler, 2010; H¨ohle, 2009;
Morgan & Demuth 1996). At the same time, however, certain domains/functions
of prosody do not seem to be mastered in an adultlike fashion before puberty, such
as prosodic comprehension skills involved in chunking, or the prosodic abilities re-
quired to understand or produce ﬁnal focus in English and Dutch (e.g., Chen, 2011;
Wells, Pepp´e, & Goulandris, 2004). Furthermore, prosody can be impaired in a
large number of clinical populations with language or communication problems,
such as speciﬁc language disorders (e.g., Wells & Pepp´e, 2003), deafness (e.g.,
Parker & Rose, 1990), Down syndrome (e.g., Heselwood, Bray, & Crookston,
1995), Williams syndrome (e.g., Catterall, Howard, Stojanovik, Szczerbinski, &
Wells, 2006), aphasia (e.g., Seddoh, 2004), schizophrenia (e.g., Pascual, Sol´e,
Castill´on, Abad´ıa, & Tejedor, 2005), epilepsy (e.g., Sanz-Mart´ın, Guevara, Corsi-
Cabrera, Ondarza-Rovira, & Ramos-Loyo, 2006), and autism spectrum disorders
(e.g., Baltaxe & Simmons, 1985; Filipe, Frota, Castro, & Vicente, 2014; Filipe,
Frota, Villagomez, & Vicente, 2016). It is important to note that although the
functions of prosody tend to be quite general across languages, prosodic systems
are known to vary considerably, and prosodic cues are strikingly language speciﬁc
(Frota & Prieto, 2015a; Jun, 2005, 2014; Ladd, 2008). Therefore, studies focusing
on different languages are critical for cross-linguistic comparisons, which in turn
are necessary for a better understanding of prosodic development and prosodic im-
pairments. These are strong reasons for prosodic skills to be more widely studied
in typical and impaired language development.

European Portuguese (EP) poses challenging questions for the study of lan-
guage development, due to the atypical prosodic proﬁle of the language. EP
includes properties of both Romance and Germanic languages in its phonology
and prosody. EP prosody combines typical Romance properties with Germanic-
like properties. Unlike Spanish, the rhythm of EP is characterized by a mix of

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5
Filipe et al.: Prosodic development in European Portuguese

1047

syllable-timed and stress-timed features, thus combining Romance-like syllable
timing with Germanic-like stress timing (Frota & Vig´ario, 2001). EP displays a
clear cluster of cues to signal the beginnings and ends of words, like English and
other Germanic languages, but at the same time allows for ﬁnal word consonants
to take the initial position of the following word (resyllabiﬁcation) as in Romance
languages (Vig´ario, 2003). The intonation contours of EP are characterized by
sparse accentuation; that is, they show fewer tonal events than in Spanish or other
Romance languages, approximating the hat pattern contour characteristic of Dutch
(Frota, 2014). However, like Spanish, there is no deaccenting of the sort found
in West Germanic languages when the prominence is not ﬁnal in the utterance
(Frota, 2014; Frota & Prieto, 2015b). In addition, unlike in English, pitch accent
placement is not the critical means to express focus. In Romance languages sev-
eral strategies may apply to convey narrow/contrastive focus depending on the
language/variety, namely, the use of a particular type of pitch accent, sometimes
with the presence of postnuclear accents, or changes in word order (Frota, 2014;
Ladd, 2008). In the case of EP, all the Romance-like strategies have been reported
to apply, with the prosodic focus strategy signaled by a particular type of accentu-
ation being the most frequently used by Standard EP speakers (Fernandes, 2007;
Frota, 2000, 2014). In short, EP stands as an interesting case for the study of
prosodic development, with cross-linguistic implications for the understanding of
developmental paths for form–meaning relations in different languages, as well as
for the understanding of prosodic impairments.

Research on prosodic skills requires the development of tools to assess prosody
in a systematic and comprehensive way adapted to the speciﬁcities of the language
observed. The use of diverse methodologies of prosodic assessment may lead to
contradictory ﬁndings and/or to ﬁndings that cannot be compared (McCann &
Pepp´e, 2003; Pepp´e et al., 2010). There are presently few procedures available
to assess prosodic abilities. For instance, in the United Kingdom, there is the
Prosody Proﬁle (Crystal, 1982), which depends on the transcription of the into-
nation of spontaneous speech samples. In the United States, the Prosody-Voice
Screening Proﬁle is used, also requiring transcription, for the assessment of spo-
ken language in seven domains, three of which are prosodic domains: phrasing,
speech rate, and stress (Shriberg, Kwiatkowski, & Rasmussen, 1990). In Swe-
den, the Swedish procedure is used to evaluate prosody at the word, phrase, and
discourse levels (Samuelsson, Scocco, & Nettelbladt, 2003). However, none of
these instruments assesses prosodic discrimination and comprehension of mean-
ing differences conveyed by prosodic features. The only test available to examine
both receptive and expressive prosodic abilities in children over 4 years of age is
the Proﬁling Elements of Prosody in Speech-Communication (PEPS-C; Pepp´e &
McCann, 2003) developed in the United Kingdom. The PEPS-C has the following
advantages: (a) transcription skills of both lexical and prosodic elements are not
needed; (b) samples of speech are elicited in a homogeneous way across subjects
and types of populations; (c) the content of responses is the same for all partic-
ipants; (d) instructions are suitable for individuals who may have low cognitive
level; and (e) it may provide a systematic and comparable way to assess prosodic
abilities in different languages. Originally, the PEPS-C only assessed prosody in
adults (Pepp´e, Maxim, & Wells, 2000), but it was revised in 2004 and norms for
typically developing children were collected (Wells et al., 2004). Subsequently, it

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5

has been adapted to different languages, such as Spanish, Flemish, French, and
Norwegian (Pepp´e et al., 2010).

Given the absence of a procedure for the assessment of Portuguese prosody
throughout the school years, and the lack of studies on EP prosodic development
covering this age range, we adapted an English test (the PEPS-C) for use with
EP speakers. With the Portuguese version of the PEPS-C, we analyzed the devel-
opmental changes of several components of prosody between 5 years of age and
adulthood.

The PEPS-C includes tasks at two levels: formal and functional. The formal
level assesses auditory discrimination and production abilities (related to percep-
tual and motor skills) required to perform the tasks. The functional level takes into
account four prosodic functions (related to cognitive understanding and expres-
sion) organized in the four subtests affect, turn-end, chunking, and focus.

The affect subtest is associated with the expression of feelings or emotions, that
is, with affective meanings in the sense of Gussenhoven (2016; for instance, a
more prolonged and high intonation suggests positive affects, as shown in Banse
& Scherer, 1996). Speciﬁcally, it uses the difference between like and dislike
intonation. As the intonation patterns used in the expression of liking and disliking
in EP were largely unknown, a study was performed to provide a systematic
account of these prosodic patterns (Filipe, Branco, Frota, Castro, & Vicente, 2015).
The results showed that, as in English, in EP the meaning of liking is expressed
by rise–fall pitch movements. However, for disliking, the EP results showed a
more ﬂat melodic pattern with a fall in the stressed syllable. These ﬁndings have
shown that the intonation patterns for liking and disliking exhibit differences
across languages (namely, in English, Spanish, and EP), highlighting the language
speciﬁcity of prosodic contours even in the expression of affective meanings.

The other three subtests examine linguistic meanings. The turn-end subtest
uses the differences between interrogative and declarative intonation. In EP, as
in English, interrogatives are expressed by rising intonation, whereas declaratives
are marked by falling intonation (e.g., Frota, 2002). However, unlike in English,
which uses word order together with prosody to differentiate interrogatives from
declaratives, in EP the interrogative/declarative distinction is crucially marked by
prosody only (Frota, 2002; Frota, Butler, & Vig´ario, 2014; Mateus et al., 2003).

The chunking subtest relates to the prosodic cues that disambiguate the syntac-
tic structure of what is being said (e.g., the segmentation of utterances marked by
prosodic features, such as pauses). The chunking function is expressed through
similar prosodic correlates in English and EP, as EP resorts to ﬁnal lengthen-
ing, pitch movement, and pauses (e.g., Fal´e, 2005; Frota, 2000; Vig´ario, 2003).
However, languages may weigh the various prosodic cues for chunking differ-
ently (Seidl & Cristia, 2008; Wellmann, Holzgrefe, Truckenbrodt, Wartenburger,
& H¨ohle, 2012), and there are no studies on cue weighting for EP.

The focus subtest uses prominence to signal the element that carries more in-
formative load, that is, the element that is highlighted in the utterance. Previous
work on prosodic focus in EP had shown that the prosodic strategy (i.e., placement
of main prominence and use of a particular pitch accent) is frequently used by
Standard EP speakers (Fernandes, 2007; Frota, 2000, 2014). As in English, con-
trastive focus in EP is generally expressed by means of prominence and intonation,
although in important different ways. In English, pitch accent placement, together

1049

with deaccenting of given (i.e., nonfocused elements) are the main strategies used;
in EP, focus is expressed by choice of pitch accent type and there is no systematic
deaccenting of nonprominent material (e.g., Frota, 2000).

The description of the prosodic system of EP has advanced during the last few
years (see Frota, 2014, for a review), and there has been recent work in the ﬁeld of
prosodic acquisition both in early perception and in production (Butler, Vig´ario,
& Frota, 2016; Frota et al., 2014; Frota, Matos, Cruz, & Vig´ario, 2016). The
adaptation of a test such as the PEPS-C to assess EP prosodic development from
preschool through adulthood will allow new studies covering prosodic develop-
ment. Therefore, the current study intends to (a) describe the adaptation of the
PEPS-C to EP, (b) examine the typical developmental trajectory of several aspects
of EP prosody after the age of 5, and (c) compare the results obtained with ﬁndings
reported by other studies using comparable methodologies for other languages.
Thus, this paper aims to address the following two research questions:

1. How do receptive and expressive prosodic abilities of EP speakers change from
childhood to adulthood? Speciﬁcally, we analyzed prosodic abilities assessed by
the PEPS-C: to discriminate and produce short and long prosodic utterances,
as well as the use of prosody to signal affect patterns (i.e., the expression of
liking and disliking), to indicate sentence-type distinctions (i.e., interrogative vs.
declarative), to mark speech chunks (i.e., the distinction between simple and
compound nouns, or different groupings of properties that qualify nouns), and to
highlight (focus on) a particular word. The typical developmental data obtained
may serve as a basis for comparison with speciﬁc clinical populations.

2. Are developmental trajectories in EP between 5 and 20 years of age similar to
those that have been described for English and Spanish speakers; in other words,
do we ﬁnd similar milestones? Using the PEPS-C, Wells et al. (2004) found
that for English some prosodic skills are present by the age of 5, while other
abilities continue to develop until the age of 11. Results for the Spanish PEPS-C
(Mart´ınez-Castilla & Pepp´e, 2008) showed that after the age of 7, every age group
performed above chance level being near or reaching ceiling scores, except for
the expression of focus, and that scores continued to rise with age especially for
the chunking and focus subtests. A comparison of the results from the English
PEPS-C and the Spanish PEPS-C showed that the developmental paths and the
degree of differences across age groups was not similar for all tasks, in particular
for the chunking and the focus tasks, with Spanish speakers reaching above
chance performance later than English speakers. As EP includes properties of
both Romance and Germanic languages in its prosody, the question arises as to
whether developmental paths for Portuguese speakers will approximate those of
Spanish or of English speakers, or will show a mix pattern depending on the
form–meaning relation and task.

(Raven, 1995).

6-year-olds, 7-year-olds, 8-year-olds, 9-year-olds, 10- to 11-year-olds, 12- to 13-
year-olds, 14- to 15-year-olds, 16- to 17-year-olds, and 18- to 20-year-olds. All
participants met our inclusion criteria: (a) they were native speakers of EP, born
and raised in monolingual homes in the north of Portugal; (b) they had no sig-
niﬁcant visual or hearing problems; (c) they had no history of language and/or
learning difﬁculties according to educators’ and/or parent reports; and (d) they
scored within the typical range in a vocabulary test (the Peabody Picture Vocab-
ulary Test; Dunn & Dunn, 2007; Portuguese adaptation and norms by Vicente,
Sousa, & Silva, 2011) and in a nonverbal intelligence test (the Raven’s Coloured
Progressive Matrices; Raven, 1995; Portuguese adaptation and norms by Sim˜oes,
2000). The recruitment of participants was in accordance with the ethical prin-
ciples that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki (developed by the World
Medical Association). Participants or caregivers of participants were selected via
notices in schools. All procedures described in this study were approved by the
schools’ boards. Informed consent was obtained from caregivers of participants
under 18 years of age, and from the participants themselves if 18 or older, following
Portuguese regulations.

Material

The PEPS-C was used to evaluate the participants’ prosodic abilities. This in-
strument includes tasks at two levels: formal and functional. The formal level
assesses auditory discrimination and production abilities required to perform
the tasks, whereas the functional level evaluates receptive (comprehension) and

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5

1051

expressive (production) prosodic skills in four domains where prosody usually
plays an important role: (a) affect (liking vs. disliking), (b) turn-end (questions
vs. statements), (c) chunking (prosodic phrasing), and (d) focus (contrastive stress
conveyed by accent placement, i.e., nuclear prominence on a particular word).
The distinction between formal and functional levels is also relevant as they can
be differently affected. Whereas some individuals have difﬁculties in mimicking
and discriminating prosodic patterns (formal level), others have problems with
understanding the meanings and producing the intended social or interactional
meanings (functional level).

The PEPS-C runs though pictures that are presented successively on a laptop
screen. The instrument has 12 subtests, with a preliminary vocabulary check to
conﬁrm that the vocabulary items used in the test are familiar to the participant.
Six of the subtests address receptive ability, and the other 6 expressive ability.
Each subtest begins with 2 examples and 2 training items, followed by 16 exper-
imental items (the maximum score for each subtest is 16). The receptive tasks
present binary choices with low working-memory requirements, resulting in two
possible responses, whereas the expressive tasks require the production of speech
and are open to more response possibilities. All the stimuli were selected on the
basis of appropriateness of cultural meaning, a high degree of familiarity, and
ease of pronunciation. The EP version of the PEPS-C generally follows the struc-
ture of the original English battery, as all the communicative functions evaluated
are found in both languages. Furthermore, it is essential to build similar versions
when one of the goals is cross-linguistic comparison. However, the adaptation also
included some modiﬁcations in order to address different uses of prosody in EP.
The following paragraphs present a short description of the adaptation process,
including the modiﬁcations introduced. Detailed information about the original
and the Portuguese version of the PEPS-C can be found in Appendix A, and a full
description of the original version can be found at http://www.peps-c.com/.

As mentioned, the ﬁrst test in the PEPS-C is a vocabulary check. In addition,
the Portuguese version includes a routine to check the understanding of facial
expressions, to avoid any bias on the performance in the affect subtest, which
resorts to the interpretation of facial expressions of like and dislike.

Prosodic skills at the formal level (that correspond to the acoustic and auditory-
perceptual characteristics of the signal, such as the F0 features of the melodic
pattern) are assessed in two subtests:

1. Short-item, receptive, and expressive tasks:

Aim: To assess the ability to perceive and imitate intonation differences in items
with one, two, or three syllables (e.g., “P ˆERA” “pear”). The receptive stimuli
have no lexical information.
Receptive task: The task consists of same/different trials, in which two sounds
are presented, and the participant indicates whether the sounds are the same
or different, by clicking on a symbol for “same” (two red circles) or one for
“different” (a red circle and green square). The original version uses laryngeal
recordings (i.e., signals made by recording sounds from the larynx only, having
no lexical information) as stimuli. However, in the Portuguese version short-
items from the turn-end and affect receptive tasks underwent low-pass ﬁltering

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5
Filipe et al.: Prosodic development in European Portuguese

1052

(upper limit 500 Hz) using PRAAT software (Boersma & Weenink, 2011), and
thus resulting in a different form of delexicalization that preserved the prosodic
features.
Expressive task: A sound stimulus is presented, and the participant imitates types
of intonation from the turn-end and affect receptive tasks.

2. Long-item, receptive and expressive tasks:

Aim: To assess the ability to perceive and imitate prosodic differences in long-
items, that is, items with six or seven syllables (e.g., “PORTA, CHAVES E LEITE”
“door, keys, and milk”).
Receptive and expressive tasks: Same procedure as for short items; however, the
stimuli are from the chunking and focus receptive tasks.

The assessment of prosodic functions aimed to evaluate the pragmatic and lin-
guistic meanings of prosody in communication. As prosodic patterns can facilitate
perceptual judgments by providing added meanings, a functional analysis is ex-
tremely important to understand the development of prosodic abilities. Prosodic
skills at the functional level are captured in four subtests, each with a receptive and
an expressive dimension. One of the subtests assesses form–meaning relations that
express meanings related to the state of the speaker, namely, affective meanings:
the affect subtest. The other three assess form–meaning relations at the linguistic
level, that is, meanings related to the message conveyed: turn-end, chunking, and
focus.

1. Affect, receptive and expressive tasks:

Aim: To assess the ability to understand and produce the affective meanings of
liking and disliking through intonation.
Receptive task: A sound stimulus with a “liking” or a “disliking” intonation
is presented simultaneously with the image representing the object mentioned.
Then two images appear, a happy and a sad face, and the participant has to select
the image corresponding to the intonation pattern heard (smiley face for “liking”
intonation or sad face for “disliking” intonation). High-frequency stimuli are
used with an acquisition age equal to or less than 5 selected through the written
lexical databases PORLEX (Gomes & Castro, 2003) and CORLEX (Nascimento,
Casteleiro, Marques, Barreto, & Amaro, 2009), as well as a study of age of
acquisition of Portuguese words (Cameir˜ao & Vicente, 2010). For the recording
of the audio stimuli, and given that the intonation patterns used in the expression
of liking and disliking in EP were largely unknown, a study was performed to
provide a systematic account of these prosodic patterns (Filipe et al., 2015). The
results show that, as in English, in EP liking has a pattern expressed by rise–fall
pitch movements. However, for disliking, the EP results show a more ﬂat melodic
pattern with a fall in the stressed syllable.
Expressive task: One picture of food appears on the screen, the participant is
asked to produce “liking” or “disliking” intonation according to his/her own
preference. To show what they want to convey with the utterance produced, the
participants point to a sad or happy face. The stimuli follow the same criteria
used for the receptive task.

2. Turn-end, receptive and expressive tasks:

1053

Aim: To assess the ability to understand and produce the intonation cues indicat-
ing interrogative versus declarative intonation.
Receptive task: A declarative or interrogative pattern is presented, and the par-
ticipant identiﬁes which is the pattern heard by selecting one of two pictures
(i.e., the participant chooses the picture of a child offering a food item when
hearing an interrogative; or the image of a child reading a book that contains the
object mentioned when hearing a declarative). The selected stimuli have one to
three syllables in length, were within the semantic ﬁeld of food, and are high-
frequency words with an acquisition age of 5 years or less (we used the lexical
bases mentioned above). The audio stimuli contain typical cues of questions and
declaratives in the language. In EP, as in English, questions are expressed by
rising intonation, while declaratives are marked by falling intonation (e.g., Frota,
2002).
Expressive task: One picture of food being offered or read out from a book page
appears on the screen, and the participant says the item with suitable intonation
(i.e., interrogative or declarative pattern, respectively). The stimuli follow the
same criteria applied in the receptive task.
3. Chunking, receptive, and expressive tasks:

Aim: To assess the ability to understand and produce the delimitation of discourse
into linguistic chunks, a process that reﬂects syntactic parsing and semantic pro-
cessing (Wagner & Watson 2010).
Receptive task: As in the original version, stimuli in combinations of three to
six words are used. The ﬁrst type of stimuli is related to the distinction between
simple words and compound words. The participant hears an auditory stimu-
lus and has to select the correct picture from two possible pictures (each one
representing two or three items, for instance: ﬁsh-ﬁngers and fruit vs. ﬁsh, ﬁn-
gers, and fruit). Unlike in English, many of the compound words used in the
original version are formed using the particle “de” in Portuguese. For exam-
ple, the word “chocolate-cake” in Portuguese is “bolo de chocolate.” However,
there are Portuguese examples where prosody has a similar demarcative func-
tion differentiating compounds from lists of words. Excluding all words not
related to concrete objects, we select the following: COUVE-FLOR, BOLO-
REI, SACO-CAMA, PEIXE-ESPADA, and PORTA-CHAVES “cauliﬂower, spe-
cial Portuguese cake, sleeping bag, swordﬁsh, and key holder.” The second type
of stimuli consists of sentences with adjectives that differ in prosodic chunk-
ing, namely, the difference between pairs of socks with one or two colors. The
participant hears an auditory stimulus and has to select the correct picture from
two possible pictures. For example, the utterance MEIAS PRETAS E VERDES]
E BRANCAS “black and green] and white socks,” with an internal boundary
(]) after VERDES “green” but not after PRETAS “black,” denotes a pair of
socks with two colors (black and green) and another pair of socks with one
color (white). Whereas MEIAS PRETAS] E VERDES E BRANCAS “black] and
green and white socks,” with an internal boundary after PRETAS “black,” rep-
resents a pair of socks which are black, and another pair of socks with two
colors (green and white). Items included in the task are direct translations from
English.

For the audiorecordings, the chunking function is expressed through similar
prosodic correlates in English and EP, as EP resorts to ﬁnal lengthening, pitch
movement, and pauses (e.g., Fal´e, 2005; Frota, 2000; Vig´ario, 2003), but these
prosodic cues may have different weights in different languages (Seidl & Cristia,
2008; Wellmann et al., 2012).
Expressive task: The participant sees one picture and has to produce the sentence
that prosodically matches the visual representation. The stimuli follow the same
criteria applied in the receptive task.

4. Focus, receptive and expressive tasks:

Aim: To assess the ability to understand and produce prominence to signal the
element that carries more informative load.
Receptive task: The following instruction is given “Earlier on today, the person
on the computer bought some socks. But when she got home, she realized she
had forgotten to buy socks of one particular color. Please point to the color of
socks that the person has forgotten to buy.” Then, two different colors appear
on the screen, and the participant hears a sentence that varies in placement of
main stress (e.g., AZUIS E PRETAS “blue and black” with the word AZUIS
“blue” carrying the main prominence). The correct answer is the color they just
heard with the main prominence, or focus. Items included in the task are direct
translations from English.
Expressive task: A football game between cows and sheep was presented to the
participants, and they see a picture and hear a sentence that do not match (e.g.,
The black cow has the ball). After, they have to correct the speaker (e.g., No, the
RED cow has the ball). In the Portuguese version, some changes are introduced
in the expressive task instructions. Speciﬁcally, we remove the “NO” from the
participant’s answer (i.e., N ˜AO, A VACA VERDE TEM A BOLA “no, the green
cow has the ball” is replaced by A VACA VERDE TEM A BOLA “the green cow
has the ball”), because the initial “NO” often gets the main prominence of the
sentence. An example of an item of the expressive task is the following: if the
participant hears A OVELHA VERDE TEM A BOLA “the green sheep has the
ball,” and is seeing a green cow with the ball, the task is to correct the error saying
A VACA VERDE TEM A BOLA “the green COW has the ball” emphasizing the
word VACA COW, that is, placing the main prominence on this word. Because
Mart´ınez-Castilla and Pepp´e (2008) found some problems in the Spanish version
of the PEPS-C with respect to this task (i.e., even adult participants did not
show mastery of this function), we tested this version in a sample of 10 adult
Portuguese speakers, and the results showed no difﬁculties in carrying out the
task. Furthermore, previous work on prosodic focus in EP had shown that the
prosodic strategy (i.e., placement of main prominence and use of a particular
pitch accent) is frequently used by Standard EP speakers (Fernandes 2007; Frota
2000, 2014). The stimuli are direct translations of the English utterances.

The stimuli were recorded with a high-quality microphone (Audio-Technica
ATM89) in a soundproof room in the Speech Laboratory at the University of Porto
by a female speaker. The software used was Pro Tools LE version 5.1.1 with
48-kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution. The stimuli with the best recording
quality, most unambiguous prosody, and clear articulation were selected according

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5
Filipe et al.: Prosodic development in European Portuguese

1055

to the judgment of two of the authors. The stimuli were considered unambiguous
by 20 adult judges and were not rated as exaggerated or unnatural.

A Portable Digital Audio Recorder (Marantz PMD661) and a wireless micro-
phone system (Sennheiser EW 152 G3-A-model 503102) were used to record
participants’ performance on the PEPS-C expressive tasks. We used SPSS version
20.0 for the statistical analyses.

Procedure

The administration of the PEPS-C was performed in one session lasting approxi-
mately 45 min. Participants were assessed in school or at home in a quiet room with
adequate lighting conditions. The PEPS-C administration was conducted in Pow-
erPoint on a computer screen, and the subtests order was the same for all the partic-
ipants: short-item, long item, turn-end, affect, chunking, and focus. Half of the par-
ticipants started with the receptive tasks and the other half with the expressive tasks.

RESULTS

For the PEPS-C receptive tasks, the experimenter coded each participant’s answer
online as correct (1 point) or incorrect (0 points). For the PEPS-C expressive tasks,
three raters judged each participant’s answers. Raters (ages between 26 and 29
years; 2 females) had in common the fact that they speak EP as their mother tongue
and the absence of any auditory or visual problems. One had expertise in the ﬁeld
of linguistics and was phonetically trained; the others had expertise in the ﬁeld of
the psychology of language. For the affect and turn-end subtests, the raters had
to categorize the answers within two possible alternatives: liking versus disliking
and statement versus question, respectively. For the chunking subtest, the raters
had two tasks: (a) for the stimuli related to socks, they had to discriminate the
socks of one color versus bicolor; and (b) for the stimulus related to compound
versus simple words, they had to decide if they heard a sentence formed by a
compound word or a sentence formed only by single words. For the focus subtest,
they had to recognize where the focus was in a set of ﬁve possible alternatives.
Each participant’s answer was scored as correct (with 1 point) only when the three
raters agreed in the classiﬁcation. There was 91% overall agreement between the
raters’ classiﬁcation.

Means and standard deviations for all the PEPS-C subtests (short-item, long-
item, affect, turn-end, chunking, and focus) separately for receptive and expressive
tasks and for age group are presented in Table 2, as well as the developmental
trajectories for the PEPS-C receptive and expressive tasks in Figures 1 and 2, re-
spectively. No effects of presentation order were found. We conducted an analysis
of variance using difference and Helmert contrasts for each dependent variable to
examine the degree of change in all the PEPS-C tasks with age (from 5 years to
adulthood). Particularly, the difference contrast compares each age group, except
the ﬁrst, to the mean of the previous groups (i.e., adult vs. all children, 16- to
17-year-olds to all younger participants, 14- to 15-year-olds to all younger partici-
pants, etc.). The Helmert contrast compares each age group, except the last, to the
mean of the subsequent groups (i.e., 5-year-olds to all older participants, 6-year-

olds to all older participants, and so on). In addition, due to the high risk of chance
performances (i.e., score obtained if the participant performed at random) in the
receptive tasks, we considered that participants reached above chance performance
in a speciﬁc task if their score was at least 12 (75%). Within the psycholinguistics
approach adopted by the PEPS-C, ceiling effects or no differences between adult

DISCUSSION

The aim of this study was to analyze the developmental trajectories of a set
of prosodic abilities in a group of Portuguese typically developing participants
(providing typical data useful for comparison with the performance of atypical
populations), and to investigate whether the developmental path of prosodic abil-
ities in EP differed from that described for other languages, namely, English and
Spanish, on the basis of comparable methodologies. Two research questions were
addressed.

Research question 1: How do receptive and expressive prosodic abilities
of EP speakers change from childhood to adulthood?

Overall, results conﬁrmed ﬁndings from other studies that prosody continues to
develop throughout the school years (e.g., Chen, 2011; Wells et al., 2004). Specif-
ically, results showed that some prosodic skills are already acquired by the age
of 5, while others continue to develop with age until adulthood, a pattern that
was especially found for chunking and focus. Milestones for the mastering of the
different prosodic skills assessed were identiﬁed: 5-year-olds reached ceiling ef-
fects in the affective prosodic tasks, and the pattern of performance was globally
similar across age groups; 7-year-olds mastered the ability to discriminate and
produce short prosodic items, as well as the ability to understand question ver-
sus declarative intonation; 8-year-olds mastered the ability to discriminate long
prosodic items; 9-year-olds mastered the ability to produce question versus declar-
ative intonation, as well as the ability to identify focus; 10- to 11-year-olds mas-
tered the ability to produce long prosodic items; 14- to 15-year-olds mastered
the ability to comprehend and produce syntactically ambiguous utterances dis-
ambiguated by prosody; and 18- to 20-year-olds mastered the ability to produce
focus. These developmental trends (summarized in Table 2) may serve as a basis
for comparison with speciﬁc clinical populations.

Our results show that prosodic form–meaning relations that express affective
meanings (the affect subtest) seem to be acquired earlier than form–meaning
relations that convey linguistic meanings. This ﬁnding might be explained by the
overall less arbitrary nature of affective meanings, which are more deeply rooted
in anatomical and physiological effects on prosody and are thus more biologically
grounded (Gussenhoven, 2002; Ohala, 1996).

Different milestones were also found for formal (globally acquired earlier)
and functional levels. The distinction between formal and functional levels, used
by the PEPS-C, is particularly relevant for atypical populations, where prosodic
abilities can be affected differently. For instance, impairments at the functional

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5
Filipe et al.: Prosodic development in European Portuguese

1062

level are possible, without difﬁculties at the formal level (Pepp´e & McCann,
2003)

Research question 2: Are developmental milestones in EP similar to those
that have been described for English- and Spanish-speaking children?

In previous studies, English-speaking children performed above chance level on
the PEPS-C in most groups tasks (Wells et al., 2004), and the same general pattern
was found for the majority of the PEPS-C tasks for Spanish (Mart´ınez-Castilla
& Pepp´e, 2008), as well as for Portuguese-speaking children. This overall sim-
ilar pattern indicates that prosodic skills develop with age. However, previous
studies have also shown that different form–meaning relations do not necessarily
develop at the same pace across languages. For English, both in receptive and
expressive tasks, affect and chunking reach above chance scores (around or above
75%) earlier (i.e., already at age 5) than turn-end. Moreover, more reﬁned skills
for using and understanding prosodic features continue to develop for English:
both in receptive and expressive tasks, affect and turn-end reach higher scores
(above 85%) earlier than chunking. The ability to produce focus is achieved
earlier at age 5, but the ability to understand focus shows a later development
reaching higher scores (above 85%) around age 13 (Pepp´e et al., 2010; Wells
et al., 2004). For Spanish, focus was found to develop even slower than for En-
glish (Mart´ınez-Castilla & Pepp´e, 2008). In the case of EP, a clear pattern emerged
with affect acquired ﬁrst, then turn-end, then chunking, and ﬁnally focus. Thus,
if for all languages there are aspects of prosody that are acquired early (e.g.,
affect) and other aspects that continue to develop after the age of 5, the devel-
opmental paths followed may differ. The cross-linguistic comparison between
ages of achievement of the higher scores (85% correct answers) are presented in
Table 3.

Some prosodic contrasts are easier to perceive for younger Portuguese-speaking
children relative to English-speaking children (and Spanish-speaking children as
well), namely, the contrast between the intonation cues indicating interrogative
versus declarative (turn-end). This is an interesting result that is in line with re-
cent infant speech perception ﬁndings showing that EP infants, but not English
infants, are able to discriminate the prosody of declaratives and interrogatives
as early as from 5 months (Frota et al., 2014; Sundara, Molnar, & Frota, 2015).
In EP the interrogative/declarative distinction is crucially marked by prosodic
means only (viz., falling versus falling-rising pitch), whereas English uses word
order together with prosody to differentiate interrogatives from declaratives. It has
been shown that English infants are able to distinguish the two sentence types
on the sole basis of word order cues by 12 months of age (Geffen & Mintz,
2014). Spanish also uses word order cues for the sentence type distinction to
a certain extent, although in different ways (and lower frequency) than English
(Hualde & Prieto 2015). The differences in the grammar of these languages with
respect to the declarative/interrogative difference may thus impact prosodic de-
velopment. Furthermore, the fact that intonation contours in EP are characterized
by sparse accentuation, unlike in Spanish (where almost every content word is
pitch accented, Hualde & Prieto, 2015) and also unlike in English (Dainora,

2006), may render pitch changes perceptually more prominent and thus easier to
perceive.

Some prosodic contrasts are hard to achieve for younger Portuguese-speaking
children, namely, the production of chunking, mastered by 14/15 years of age,
and focus expression, which is only mastered by 18/20 years of age. It is known
that although languages can use similar prosodic cues for chunking, they can
nevertheless assign different weights to such cues (Seidl & Cristia, 2008). Two
types of stimuli were used in the chunking subtest: (a) compound words, which
are clearly lexical words in the language, were contrasted with phrases; and (b)
lists of adjectives with different chunking ([A and B] and C vs. A and [B and
C]). The latter type was adapted directly from English, for comparison reasons.
Listing in EP usually tends to be marked by prosodic boundaries, independent
of the combined structures listed. There is ongoing work suggesting that the
ﬁrst type of stimuli is very strongly marked by a cluster of contrasting prosodic
cues in EP (Severino, 2016), unlike for listing-type structures, and that these
prosodic cues are enough to disambiguate compound words from phrases already
at the age of 5. The prosodic cues of ﬁnal lengthening and pitch movement,
found in the compound word/phrases chunking contrast, are similar in type to
those that signal the difference between declarative and interrogative, although
the prosodic structure involved is more complex given the comparison between
different numbers of prosodic phrases. Future work needs to look at the speciﬁc
prosodic cues used in the two sets of stimuli, and examine whether the adjective
type can be considered a typical case of chunking contrast in EP.

However, the most frequent errors were in the focus subtest, with the placement
of prominence in the ﬁnal word of the sentence instead of the early prominence
targeted in the subtest item. This result is similar to ﬁndings for Spanish-speaking
children (Mart´ınez-Castilla & Pepp´e, 2010), but is different from English, a
language where the focus expressive ability is reported to be acquired by age
5 (Wells et al., 2004; although this is also the skill with the higher incidence of
ambiguous responses in the particular case of ﬁnal narrow focus). These results
suggest that the abilities to produce focus follow a slower developmental trajec-
tory in Romance languages (such as Spanish and Portuguese) than in Germanic
languages (such as English).

Mart´ınez-Castilla and Pepp´e (2010) highlight that the PEPS-C focus subtest
structure that assesses preﬁnal contrastive focus may not be measuring the most
common strategy for expressing focus in Spanish, which is based on word order.
However, this reasoning may not apply to EP, since in EP, as in English or Dutch,
placement of main prominence to express contrastive focus is used as a common
strategy (Chen, 2011; Fernandes, 2007; Frota, 2000, 2012). Although in these
languages focus is generally expressed by means of prominence and intonation,
there are crucial differences between English and Dutch and EP. In English and
Dutch, accentuation of focused material and deaccenting of nonfocused material
is the common strategy, so a preﬁnal focused word is followed by no other pitch
accent. In EP, a particular type of pitch accent is used for focus, and a preﬁnal
focused word is usually followed by a postfocal accent (Frota, 2014; Frota &
Prieto, 2015a). In short, EP is both different from Spanish and from English with
respect to focus marking.

Applied Psycholinguistics 38:5
Filipe et al.: Prosodic development in European Portuguese

1065

It has been shown, on the basis of spontaneous production data, that EP children
produce prosodic focus early in development (chronological age between 1 year, 9
months and 1 year, 10 months; Frota, Butler, et al., 2016; Frota & Vig´ario, 2008).
Results from a parental report about early prosodic development in EP (Proso-
Quest) showed that EP children already perceived focus at around 13 months and
produced focus at around 18 months (Vig´ario, Correia, & Butler, 2013). Moreover,
in a speech discrimination task using visual habituation, EP infants were found to
differentiate the prosodic cues of focused items from those of nonfocused items
(Butler et al., 2016). In addition, adult Portuguese speakers showed no difﬁculties
in carrying out the focus subtest in the PEPS-C. Therefore, we may conclude that
the focus subtest is assessing a strategy that is available and is common in the
language. It may, nevertheless, be the case that the speciﬁc subtest in the PEPS-C
could be a more cognitively demanding task for EP children. Unlike in English,
in EP deaccenting is not common after focus. In other words, in English there
are typically no pitch accents after a contrastive focus, and thus the contrastive
focus corresponds to the ﬁnal prominence in the utterance. In EP pitch accents are
common after a nonﬁnal focus, and thus the preﬁnal focused word is not simply
marked by the last pitch accent in the utterance. This difference across languages
could be a factor contributing to the later development of the focus ability, as it is
assessed by the PEPS-C. Even though it might be necessary to further adjust this
subtest to the prosodic speciﬁcities of the target language, in the case of EP, we
can assume that the mastery of focus ability and the use of this skill in an explicit
way is developed later than the affect, turn-end, and chunking prosodic abilities.
In sum, by the age of 5, some prosodic skills are already acquired by Portuguese-
speaking children, while others continued to develop with age until adulthood,
especially in the case of the chunking and focus abilities. Cross-linguistic data
suggests that form–meaning relations that express affective meanings are acquired
earlier than form–meaning relations that convey linguistic meanings, in line with
the more general nature of the former and the more language-speciﬁc nature of
the latter. Furthermore, linguistic form–meaning relations do not necessarily de-
velop at the same pace across languages, a fact that seems to ﬁnd explanation in
the language-particular features of the prosodic system. These ﬁndings highlight
the need to study languages with different prosodic proﬁles, such as EP, using
comparable methods and tools. The results from typically developing Portuguese
speakers should be useful for educators, teachers, therapists, and other profes-
sionals, providing information guidelines about the development and mastery of
prosodic skills between ages 5 and 20.

We can conclude that the prosodic functions evaluated with the PEPS-C are
age sensitive for EP, since the children understood the tasks and their performance
improved with age. However, further research should address the validity and reli-
ability of this test. Furthermore, although the PEPS-C stands as an improvement in
terms of prosodic assessment (as transcription skills, of both lexical and prosodic
elements, are not needed; samples of speech are elicited in a homogeneous way
across subjects and types of populations; and instructions are suitable for individu-
als who may have low cognitive levels), this instrument still raises some concerns.
The full assessment is time consuming, and ecological validity still needs to be
tested (i.e., measures need to be feasible for real-world settings).
