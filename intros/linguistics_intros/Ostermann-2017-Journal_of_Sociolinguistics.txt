INTRODUCTION.
Issues of how to analyze gender and sexual identities in interaction have been
largely already discussed, in particular in the field of Conversation Analysis
(CA) (Schegloff 1997, 1998; Wetherell 1998; Kitzinger 2000; Speer and
Stokoe 2011). Some of the criticism addressed by conversation analysts is that
much of the research on the relationships between language, gender, and
sexuality lies in understanding speakers and talk as predetermined by abstract
discourses ‘from above’ or ‘beyond’ talk (Speer and Stokoe 2011: 7).
Schegloff (1997) claims that gender has to be demonstrably relevant to the
participants – instead of being (a priori and exogenously) imposed by analysts –
in order to be used as an analytical social category in social interaction. The
author notes, for instance, that
it is not enough to justify referring to someone as a ‘woman’ just because she is,
in fact, a woman – because she is, by the same token, a Californian, Jewish, a
mediator, a former weaver, my wife, and many other things. (Schegloff 1997:
165)
CA methodological criteria on what counts as analytical categories, and its
reluctance to bring wider (or macro) social issues2 – such as power,
heteronormativity, and oppression – aprioristically into the analysis, have
not gone without criticism (e.g. Wetherell 1998). In response to the criticism of
CA’s conceptualization of what actually is relevant to the participants or what
constitutes participants’ orientation to gender (e.g. Wetherell 1998; Ehrlich
2002), a number of scholars have demonstrated how powerful the
conversational analytical lenses might be at grasping gender and sexual
identities in action (e.g. Ehrlich 2002; Kitzinger 2005, 2007; Speer and Stokoe
2011; Ostermann and Kitzinger 2012). As Weatherall (2002: 768) points out,
[b]eing limited, as an analyst, to the overtly displayed concerns of the
participants is not to say that gender is not omni-relevant. What it does mean
is that it is incumbent on the researcher to show how and that gender as omnirelevant
is produced and oriented to.
Moreover, once analysts have demonstrated and described the specific and
practical ways of how gender is actualized in interaction, this might also allow
them to show how such practices could possibly be changed (Ostermann and
Kitzinger 2012).
Aligned with the perspective taken by other studies interested in unveiling
how participants orient to gender and sexuality in talk and how larger social
constructs come into being in social interaction, the current study also takes
up Garfinkel’s ethnomethodological claim (1967) that it is part of the analysts’
task to actually show how interactants’ production of their everyday activities
is informed by certain categorizations and how the interactants demonstrate
their oriention to them (Stokoe 2000, 2006; Stokoe and Smithson 2001;
Stokoe and Weatherall 2002; Speer and Stokoe 2011). In other words, the
analysis and discussion presented in this paper assume an understanding
that interactants are continuously attributing meaning to and
demonstrating their understanding of interactions, the world around
them and what is happening here and now. Thus, a close analysis of
naturally occurring interactions is taken here as central to explaining the
methods and everyday practices that participants use in order to produce
such worlds (Garfinkel 1967; Speer and Stokoe 2011).
Such perspective also reflects how this paper connects with the special theme
of this issue. The perspective assumed here is not one of North and South, West
and non-West, developed and developing (or even underdeveloped), First and
Third World, center and periphery, or the macro and micro. Instead, it
assumes a tentatively less dichotomous perspective that proposes to simply
shift our point of departure by first looking at the ‘margins’ (Milani 2014), and
only then investigating how the margins – perhaps unavoidably – relate (or
not) to what has been taken to be the ‘metropole’.
What I propose, in fact, is not new: to (firstly) look at and (only later)
theorize from language where language is actually used; to look at and theorize
from the actual sites where people are interacting in the world to carry out
their everyday affairs, investigating how they orient (or not) to certain
categories and how they make sense of the world while doing so.3 In this sense,
Conversation Analysis and categorization analysis serve as empowering
analytical lenses to investigate participants’ own understandings and
categorizations of gender and sexuality.
In order to frame the analysis of this paper within the larger theme of the
Special Issue, I take here Comaroff and Comaroff’s invitation (2012a: 1),
originally formulated as ‘What if we posit that, in the present moment, it is the
global south that affords privileged insight into the workings of the world at
large?’ (emphasis added), and modify it slightly so as to propose that ‘What if
we posit that [. . .] it is the micro level of everyday interactions that affords
privileged insight into the workings of the world at large’?
This work, thus, investigates the micro level of talk-in-interaction itself in the
production and naturalization of understandings of gender and sexuality. By
analyzing language as it is used by people when conducting their everyday
affairs, the study looks at how ‘heteronormativity’ (Warner 1991) or
‘compulsory heterosexuality’ (Rich 1980; Butler 1990) are actualized in
naturalistic data, and how intersubjectivity (understood here as the
participants’ mutual understandings), in particular when at stake, might
reveal ‘heteronormativity in action’, to borrow Kitzinger’s (2005) words. By
relying on such an analytical perspective, the paper also aims to call into
question the traditional dichotomy of the micro and macro perspectives,
demonstrating how the interactional moment, as a condensed historicity of
participants’ own understandings and categorizations of gender and sexuality,
seems to respond to a wider sociocultural repertoire which makes what is local
simultaneously translocal.

SITUATING THE SETTING, DATA, AND METHODS.
Helplines, the interactional context of interest here, are dedicated telephonebased
services (delivered by both the private and public sector) that provide
some type of assistance, guidance and/or simply information on a range of
topics or concerns, such as legal, medical, emotional, among others (Baker,
Emmison and Firth 2005). An example of a helpline would be a phone number
made available by a software company to help customers with
troubleshooting.
Within the context of helplines, it is by means of talk-in-interaction that
callers and call takers conduct their main business, i.e. to request for and
receive some type of help – whose nature, of course, can vary. In addition, it is
by means of talk-in-interaction that specific meanings are negotiated, and the
participants’ reasoning, assumptions and beliefs are rendered visible.
The wider study from which this investigation derives comprises 308 audio
recorded and fully transcribed, naturally occurring phone-call interactions
directed to a Brazilian governmental health helpline, Centro de Informac~oes
sobre Saude (also referred to here as CIS).4 That is a toll free number, created by
the Brazilian Ministry of Health to provide citizens with health information and
referrals. Most users of the helpline are working-class citizens with low
educational background whose access to health information (including
internet access) is limited.
The interactions analyzed for the larger investigation from which this study
derives, and whose main purpose was to investigate morality in action in
interactions in women’s public health services in Brazil, were limited to those
initiated by a citizen, and then only those in which the caller selected ‘women’s
health’ in the initial menu, and further selected one of the following topics in
the submenu: HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, cancer or
contraception.
As is the case for most telephone services in Brazil nowadays, all CIS calls are
automatically recorded by the management for quality control, with callers
being informed of the recording at the start of every call by means of an
automated message. It is important to register, however, that all calls are
anonymous. At no instance in the interactions are callers asked to reveal their
names. Thus, in order to ensure the highest possible ethical care while
simultaneously abiding by the institutional demand to not interfere with their
current practices at the time, written permission for participation in the study
was requested only from the call takers.5 Those who chose not to take part in
the study had their wish respected and, thus, the institutional recordings of
their calls were not analyzed. In addition, any mention of proper names that
might indicate who the participants are, including names of cities, streets, and
institutions, were replaced by fictitious ones.
The analysis presented here focusses on the final phase of the phone calls;
more specifically, the analysis is circumscribed to the phase when the
institutional representative (call taker or CT) applies a survey that requests
demographic information from the caller (C). This survey was introduced in
2010 by the Ministry of Health as part of the service provided by the
helpline, CIS. The introduction of surveys at the end of the calls was
motivated by the government’s initiative to gather statistics about the
helpline callers in order to propose actions more closely tailored to their
profiles, including the need to serve LGBTT users more adequately in the
public health system.
Out of the corpus of 308 recorded phone calls analyzed in the larger
study, only 31 contained the recording of the survey. That survey
comprised 20 questions, ordered in a pre-arranged way. Among the
information requested about the caller were age, gender, sexual orientation,
and educational level.
Despite some initial neglect of the survey recordings in the phone calls, a
closer look at the data revealed that speakers interactionally demonstrated
problems when dealing with one specific question: the one about the caller’s
sexual orientation. It is the interactional trajectory of the sequence
surrounding such a question that this paper investigates.
Following the tradition of other conversation analytical studies (Kitzinger
2000; Paoletti 2002; Speer 2005; Wilkinson and Kitzinger 2014; Lindstr€om,
N€aslund and Rubertsson 2015), in order to carry out such investigation, I
combine Conversation Analysis (CA) (Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson 1974) with
categorization analysis (Sacks 1992). Moreover, at some points in the analysis I
also rely on some ethnographic notes about the call center and its workings.
SEXUAL ORIENTATION AS INTERACTIONALLY DELICATE.
The sequence involving the actions of requesting and providing information
about the caller’s sexual orientation reveals itself as interactionally ‘delicate’
(Silverman and Per€akyl€a 1990; Per€akyl€a 1995) by the participants’
orientation to it. The first evidence for such a claim is that such a question
is deliberately moved by the CTs from its middle position in the survey list – i.e.
allocated by the Ministry of Health as the 10th out of 20 questions – to be
asked as the very last, as Figure 1 below illustrates.
This change, as reported by the call takers in informal conversations with
me, is a way to maximize the information obtained by means of the survey,
since a number of callers hang up after being asked about their sexuality.
Thus, according to the call takers, by requesting that information as the last
question in the survey, if the call is abruptly terminated, the responses to the
rest of the survey could still have been obtained.
Secondly, as an attempt to deal with the complexity of the question about
‘sexual orientation’, call takers make use of alternative ways of designing the
format of the request. The original structure of the question posed by the
Ministry of Health – an open Wh-question (What is your sexual orientation?) – is
actually informally modified and produced in three other formats, as
represented in Figure 2:
1. polar (yes/no) questions (Heritage and Raymond 2012);
2. alternative questions (Bolinger 1978); or
3. in-progress ‘list construction’ (Jefferson 1991).
Call takers reported doing this in order to facilitate the interaction. According
to them, responding ‘yes’ or ‘no’ (to a yes-no question) – instead of having to
produce an answer to an open question – should make it ‘easier’ or simpler for
the callers to respond.
Because the polar yes-no question was by far the most frequent format used by
the call takers (28 out of the 31 occurrences), it is on sequences involving that
specific format that this paper concentrates. The single occurrence of the inprogress
list construction and its interactional consequences are discussed
elsewhere (Ostermann in preparation).What follows are some examples of how
the survey open question about sexual orientation is actualized in interactions
in its different formats.6
Polar (yes/no) questions:
(1) Call taker: voc^e e heterossexua:l?
are you heterose:xual?
(2) Call taker: .h e com relac~ao a sua opc~a- a sua orientac~ao sexual voc^e e
heterossexu↑a:l
.h and in relation to your sexual opt- to your sexual orientation
are you heterosexu↑a:l
Alternative questions:
(3) Call taker: e: orientac~ao sexual voc^e se considera .h heterossexual ou
homossexual
uh: sexual orientation do you consider yourself .h heterosexual
or homosexual
In-progress list construction:
(4) Call taker: e: orientac~ao sexual voc^e se considera .h heterossexua::l,
homossexua::l,
uh: sexual orientation do you consider yourself .h heterose::xual,
homose::xual,
Such deliberate transformation, in particular, the most frequently used
format in the data set (i.e. yes-no questions), besides creating a number of
interactional problems for the participants in terms of intersubjectivity, as
discussed elsewhere (Ostermann in preparation), also reveals the workings of
heteronormativity (or of ‘heteronormativity in action’; Kitzinger 2005), as
explored in this paper.
Finally, the interactional delicacy surrounding the sequence that involves
the request and provision of information about the callers’ sexual orientation
becomes noticeable also through ‘perturbations’ (Silverman and Per€akyl€a
1990) in the participants’ talk – i.e. disturbances in their speech, such as
pauses, hesitations, repairs and laughter.
A NEUTRAL QUESTION? A PRESUPPOSED HETEROSEXUAL WORLD.
Interactional studies of naturally occurring ordinary and institutional interactions
have demonstrated that questions may perform a number of different actions
besides that of requesting information (Freed and Ehrlich 2010; Hayano 2013).
Other actions performed by questions might include inviting, challenging,
requesting accounts and initiating repair, among others (Hayano 2013).
However, questions do even more. They also communicate the questioner’s
beliefs, reasoning and expectations; questions presuppose (Heritage 2010).
When deliberately transforming an originally open question about sexuality
(‘What is your sexual orientation?’) into a yes/no interrogative (‘Are you
heterosexual?’) or an alternative question (‘Are you heterosexual or
homosexual?’) – or any combinations of the two formats – call takers
communicate some of their beliefs and assumptions about the callers and the
world. The major format used by the call takers (Y-N questions) reveals itself as
problematic for being shaped in a non-neutral format and creating
presuppositions about the caller. The alternative question-format (‘Are you
heterosexual or homosexual?’), used alone on only two occasions, creates a
binary world of sexual orientation, thus limiting the choices one might have. An
answer that does not conform to any of the choices offered in the first-pair part of
the adjacency pair will tend to demand more interactional work from the
participants and be ‘dispreferred’ (Lee 2013; Pomerantz and Heritage 2013).
Another presupposition operates in polar (yes/no) interrogatives (Heritage
2010; Raymond 2010; Ostermann and Jaeger 2012). As Heritage (2010: 51)
explains, ‘the conversation analytic term preference is used to describe the bias or
tilt of questions that are designed for, favor, or suggestanexpectation ofananswer
ofaparticular type.’ In that sense, thegrammaticaldesign of the interrogative ‘Are
you heterosexual?’ favors a ‘yes’ answer (see also Raymond 2010).
By transforming an originally open question (‘What is your sexual
orientation?’) into a yes-preferred question (‘Are you heterosexual?’ or the
alternative ‘Are you heterosexual or not?’), the call taker communicates
preference of some kind: a yes agreement. Beyond that, she/he also selects a
specificsexualorientation(oraspecificcategory)asadefault,‘morefavorable’one,
thus revealing ‘heteronormativity’ (Warner1991)–mostcommonlydiscussed as
a macro level concept – in operation at the micro level of everyday interactions.
The data show that when the caller responds affirmatively to the first
production of a yes-preferred question, her answer is not problematized and the
interaction evolves to its closing, as shown in Extract 1.
Extract 1 [Disk040909ReginaAIDS]
234 Call taker: hhh a::h a senhora se considera heterossexual
235 hhh u::h do you consider yourself heterosexual
236 Caller: ↑s:i:::m:
237 ↑y:e:::s:
238 Call taker: oquei senhora (.) muito obrigado por colabo↑ra (.) o
239 ministerio da saude agradece a sua ligac~ao ligue sempre que
240 for necessa:rio .hh tenha um ↑bom ↓di:a
241 okay mam (.) thank you very much for colla↑borating (.) the
242 ministry of health thanks you for your call call whenever
243 necessary .hh have a ↑great ↓da:y
244 Call taker: bom dia
245 have a good day
After receiving a type-conforming as well as a preference-conforming
answer by the caller (i.e. ‘yes’), the call taker immediately moves to the closing
of the interaction (lines 238–240 / 241–243). Notice that this is so despite the
markedness with which such a yes-preferred answer is produced in Excerpt 1
(lines 236 / 237) – a one syllable agreement marked not only with stretched
sounds but also with a rising intonation (↑y:e:::s:).
Conversely, in all but six cases inwhich the caller provides a no as a response, her
answer ismetwith some type of ‘problematization’ by the CT.Repair sequences are
initiated, and, as a consequence, the sequence gets extended over a number of
turns in talk until its closing. However, another fact calls attention to the data set
being analyzed. Despite the preferred yes-answer in the design of the question, and
taking into consideration that we live in a world largely defined as heterosexual
(Warner 1991), it might be somewhat intriguing that out of 28 survey
respondents replying to Y-N questions, only six categorized themselves as being
heterosexual. It is to those interactions that the next section in this paper turns.
CO-CONSTRUCTING A HETEROSEXUAL WORLD.
The sequence involving the request and provision of information about the
caller’s sexual orientation in which the caller answers negatively to being
heterosexual, in addition to revealing large confusion about what heterosexual
means, opens up trajectories of interaction that activate categorizations and
make accessible demonstrably naturalized understandings about gender and
sexuality. This section of the analysis, thus, investigates such interactional
trajectories and, in doing so, reveals the operation of heteronormativity and
compulsory heterosexuality (Rich 1980) at the very micro, social level of
human interaction. The excerpts described below were selected on the basis of
the recurrence of the phenomenon they represent in the larger corpus.
Extract 2 [DISK080909HelenaCAN]

278 oka:y mam then the ministry of health thanks for your call. call
279 whenever necessary, and have a ↑good day.
In Extract 2, after receiving a no (lines 265 / 266) to her yes-preferred question
(260–261 / 262–263) – which is delivered with a number of perturbations
(stretches, hesitations, inbreaths) – in her next turn, the CT problematizes such
an answer. Such problematization is done by means of a repair initiation
(Schegloff 1992), which consists of an unrequested explanation of what
heterosexual means – ‘a person who has affinity with the opposite ↑sex’ (lines
268–269 / 270–272). Such explanation is further modified by the CT to be
more recipient-designed, i.e. by replacing ‘a person’ with ‘a woman’ and
‘opposite sex’ with ‘a man’. In other words, the call taker designs her further
explanation of ‘heterosexual’ to be a type of relationship that is (potentially)
more adjusted to that specific caller – an adult female.
The repair initiation implemented by the CT in lines 268–269 and 270–272
reveals at least two assumptions at this point: (1) that the caller is
heterosexual and (2) that by answering negatively (i.e. that she is not
heterosexual) the caller either (2a) has not understood the CT’s question or
(2b) does not understand what heterosexual means. As revealed in the caller’s
next turn (lines 273 / 274), marked with a change of state token (‘oh:’) and
the delivered ‘online’ realization of how her sexual orientation is named (‘then
yes (hh) I hadn’t understood it very well’, in lines 273 / 274), assumptions (1)
and (2b) are interactionally revealed to be actually the case.
Another – and perhaps even stronger – instance of presupposed
heterosexuality, as well as of misunderstanding what heterosexual means,
takes place in Extract 3.
The question about the caller’s sexual orientation in Extract 3 is designed
in a slightly different way from the one in Extract 2. The yes-preferred
question (‘and are you heterose:xual’, in lines 338 / 340) is immediately
revised into a format that supposedly explains what heterosexual means
(‘that is are you attracted to the opposite ↑sex’, in lines 338–339 / 340–341)
and again into another question that further elaborates the explanation (‘are
you a[ttracted] to me:n?’, lines 339 and 344 / 341 and 345). However,
before the third question reaches a possible transition point, the caller
provides, in overlap with the CT, a negation (‘[no:]’, lines 342 / 343), which
is repeated in lines 347 and 348 – possibly to resolve possible problems of
hearing caused by the earlier overlap.
Interestingly, at this point the CT challenges (Levinson 2013) the caller’s
negative answer, by repeating the caller’s ‘no’ with rising intonation (‘no:?’,
lines 350 / 351), to which the caller answers once again with a negation (lines
353 / 354). Demonstrating that she is not yet satisfied with the caller’s third
negation, in lines 356–357 and 358–359, the CT further elaborates her
question in an alternative format that could be represented as: Are you A and
not B, or are you B?. At this point, the caller simply negates all the possibilities
presented so far. However, once again evidencing what seems to be a pursuit of
a ‘yes-I-am-heterosexual’ answer, the CT presents the question in yet another
format (‘.h are you attracted to ↑me:n’, lines 363 / 364). At this point we have
access to yet another disclosure of misunderstanding when the caller replies
that she is attracted only to her husband.
Thus, what we see happening in this interaction, just as in the previous one,
is an assumption by the CT that the caller: (1) is heterosexual and that (2) she
does not reply affirmatively because she does not understand the word
heterosexual nor any of the explanations provided by the CT – assumptions
that are again revealed to be congruent.
Interestingly, however, and differently from Extract 2, in Excerpt 3 we also
have access to an understanding and belief of the caller herself which might
represent female sexuality at a more general level: that her sexual desire is not
directed towards all or any men, but only to her husband. In terms of
categorizations, the caller makes reference to a relational pair of husband-wife
in which the wife has limited rights to sexual attraction – only to her husband
– which, in its turn, also points to a certain understanding of female sexuality:
that of fidelity or even of chastity.
Extract 4, below, reveals another made-explicit categorization by the caller
about female sexuality.
This interaction shows in so many words the caller’s problem with
understanding the CT’s question – or more specifically, with what
heterosexual means – as she explicitly initiates repair of the trouble source
question with another question, in ‘what do you mea:n?’ (lines 260 and 261).
After taking more turns to repair that understanding and others (i.e. about
what the CT means by preference), in lines 275 and 276 the CT and caller
finally seem to reach shared understanding with regards to the information
being requested. This moment comes, however, with a meaningful
categorization by the caller: that because of being a woman, her sexual
preference has to be for men. Another interesting point here is the design of her
answer – a response that does more than the simple provision of the
information requested (for a discussion on answers that resist questions and on
answers that do other (or more) than answering, see Stivers and Hayashi
2010; Walker, Drew and Local 2011; Couper-Kuhlen 2014). The caller uses
the discourse marker ne (roughly translated as ‘of course’ here) in the second
position to the question, showing thus the ‘obviousness’ of what has been
asked, in ‘[I’m] a woman of course. it has to be for men (.) °(hh)°’.
On what concerns how the answer is produced, it happens both (1) in
overlap with the previous question and (2) with an account (i.e. that she is a
woman) which is positioned before the actual provision of the requested
information (i.e. that she is attracted to men). Such features in the design of
her answer point to the relevance of the categorization in process taking place
here: that of compulsory heterosexuality, of biological sex determining her
sexual desire for males (Rich 1980; Butler 1990).
Possibly, it is Extract 5, below, that most emblematically represents all of the
complexities involved in the sequences of the helpline survey question about
the caller’s sexual orientation.
This interaction presents again a series of repair sequences. After producing
a yes-preferred question (‘are you heterosexu↑al’, lines 138 / 139), the CT’s
question is met with a long temporal gap (2.7 seconds) before the caller
initiates repair (lines 141 / 142). In lines 143 and 144, the CT offers a modified
version of a yes-preferred question, revising it into an even more strongly-yespreferring
format (‘are you ↑heterosexual or ↓not’). The double negative
particle used by the caller shows her orientation to the second version of the
question as a Y/N question indeed (and not an alternative one). In addition to
conveying assurance, the double negative might also point out that that course
of action has persisted beyond what is necessary (Stivers 2004). One could
potentially claim, however, that it is this marked answer (double negative) – in
addition to the CT’s previous experience with callers’ misunderstanding of the
term ‘heterosexual’ and his assumption of an unlikely ‘queer planet’ (Warner
1991) – that prompts the CT to challenge the caller’s knowledge of the
meaning of ‘heterosexual’ (‘do you ↑know what heterosexual means?’, lines
147 / 148). The caller, however, responds affirmatively, reiterating, thus, the
validity of her very first answer (i.e. that she is not heterosexual).
Upon returning to the task of filling in a slot in the survey about the caller’s
sexual orientation, the CT reformulates his question so as to ask whether the
caller is a lesbian (lines 151 / 152), to which she replies with a negative
without any delay (lines 153 / 154). At this point, being confronted with
negative answers to both being heterosexual and a lesbian, the CT produces a
somewhat conclusive (see the use of ‘then’) open-format question (whquestion):
‘how would you categorize your sexual orientation ↓then’ (lines 159
/ 160). The caller shows resistance to categorizing her sexual orientation in
any of the terms proposed so far. She starts her turn by first claiming that she is
‘totally feminine’, followed by a negation of the categories proposed so far: that
she is not a lesbian ‘nor anything of that kind’ (lines 162–163 / 164–165).
The interaction reveals some important categorization processes at work. By
characterizing herself with the attribute of being ‘totally feminine’ and
establishing such attribute in a relation of opposition to ‘being a lesbian’ or
‘anything of that kind’, the caller evokes an understanding of some type of
(naturalized) linearity between gender practices and sexual orientation (i.e.
that being ‘feminine’ corresponds to not being a lesbian). In addition, the caller
characterizes being a lesbian as an undesirable sexual orientation when she
places it as part of a larger collection that comprises ‘anything of that kind’,
followed by a response cry (‘[thanks ↓god(h)’], in lines 168 / 169), conveying
relief and a positive assessment of not being a member of such a (undesirable)
collection (of ‘lesbians’ and ‘anything of that kind’).
Sequentially speaking, such categorization processes seem to support the
inference the CT seems to make – that the caller does not understand what
heterosexual means. In lines 166 / 167 and 170 / 171, once again the CT looks
for confirmation of the caller’s understanding of the category ‘heterosexual’. He
does so by means of a ‘formulation’ (Heritage and Watson 1980), starting with
the conclusive ‘so’ (in ‘so you understand what heterosexual means’), which is
once again confirmed by the caller (lines 172 / 173). Important as well here is
that one could possibly speculate that, by drawing an inference from the caller’s
latest contribution (lines 162–163 / 164–165), the CT shows that he aligns
himself with the caller’s orientation to the fact that being ‘totally feminine’
cannot be an attribute of a lesbian.
The CT’s offer of an explanation of what heterosexual means (lines 174 / 175)
further evidences his pursuit of repairing what he infers to be a
misunderstanding. Upon the caller’s confirmation of her knowledge of the
meaning of heterosexual, the CT takes a new turn, however, which is not to
accept the answers provided by the caller (i.e. that she is heterosexual and that
she knows what heterosexual means). Instead, he offers her the option of not
answering the question about sexual orientation (lines 181 / 182). Interestingly,
however, the caller vehemently rejects such an offer by producing a triple
negative to the offer (‘↑no:: ↓no:: I don’t’) (see Stivers 2004) and rejecting twice
that she is heterosexual (‘↓I’m not heterosexual ↓no’, lines 183 / 184), thus
pointing out the unsuitability of such an offer.
For the third time in this sequence, the CT looks for confirmation of the
caller’s understanding of the term heterosexual (lines 186 / 187). It is at this
point that we see a dramatic change in the course of action. Right after
(re)confirming her understanding, the caller provides what should work as
some type of evidence that she knows what ‘heterosexual’ means: she informs
the call taker that she has a heterosexual cousin.
As is well known in the literature, facts have to be ‘tellable’ to be worth
reporting (Shuman 1986; Georgakopoulou 2007). By reporting that she has a
cousin who is heterosexual, besides attempting to show evidence of her
knowledge, the caller also seems to orient herself to the ‘tellable’ principle – and
so does the call taker. It is precisely that mutual orientation that provides the
evidence the CT needs to confirm the inference he was making before; i.e. that
the caller did not know the word heterosexual. In other words, by drawing on
the common sense belief of compulsory heterosexuality and, thus, that someone
being heterosexual is not frequently a ‘reportable’ event, the CT is able to draw
an important inference here. The CT produces an other-initiated-other repair,
starting his turn with a negation token (‘no’) and going on to produce the same
explanation he has made twice before, but that now corrects the caller’s
understanding (‘↓no mam. heterosexual is the person who is attracted to the
opposite sex’, in lines 190–191 / 192–193), which is accepted by the caller. In
lines 194 and 195, the caller shows realization of what her sexual orientation is
named in a turn that starts offwith a token that signals a ‘change of state’ (Heritage
1998) (‘↑o::h’ in English; originally produced as ↑a::h in Brazilian Portuguese). In
otherwords, the caller expresses havingmoved from one understanding into a new
one (‘↑o::h then I am heterosexu↓al (h)(h)(h)((laughs))’).
<Conclusion>
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS.
The interactions analyzed in this study reveal a number of facts concerning
language and its relation to gender and sexuality identities. The paper
discusses how heteronormativity emerges in interactions as a very palpable
concept both in how the questions are asked and how they are answered.
The most frequently used format to request the caller’s sexual orientation, the
polar question ‘Are you heterosexual?’, is revealed as highly problematic, both in
interactional terms as well as in the selection it makes of a range of sexual
orientation possibilities in order to serve the ‘optimization principle’ (Heritage
2010). As argued, questions do more than asking; they communicate the
questioner’s beliefs, reasoning and expectations; they presuppose. The format of
a yes-preferred question communicates preference of some kind: a yes
agreement. Moreover, the selection of a specific sexual orientation as a default,
a ‘more favorable’ one, reveals how heteronormativity – most commonly
discussed as a macro-level concept – operates at the very micro level of everyday
interactions. In other words, such selection is not neutral and works towards
(re)constructing (and actively pursuing) the normalization of an understanding
that we live on a heterosexual ‘planet’ (Warner 1991).
Nevertheless, a yet larger and more encompassing problem about questions on
sexual orientation arises, and that refers to the fact that any question format
about sexual orientation that asks what the interlocutor is (including an open
wh-question, which actually does not happen in this data set) reveals an
understanding of sexual orientation as a static one; a category a person is or
belongs to, thus not envisaging any possibility for a more queered and fluid
understanding of sexuality and sexual desire.
The analysis of the data unveils even more about naturalized
understandings of gender and sexuality. The misunderstanding of the term
‘heterosexual’ discloses in very concrete ways important heteronormative
categorizations to studies of gender and sexuality. This is the case, for instance,
when callers (as well as CTs) exhibit their understanding of some type of
linearity between sex, gender and sexuality. Thus, a woman who is supposedly
‘totally feminine’ cannot be a lesbian, a caller who has a husband who is ‘very
macho’ (as it happened in another interaction not presented here), and a
woman who is biologically female can only be attracted to men (e.g. ‘[I’m] a
woman right. it has to be for men (.) °(hh)°’). In addition, female sexual desire
is related to attributes of fidelity or even chastity, as revealed by the caller who
claims to be attracted only to her husband.
The recurrent problems of intersubjectivity around the word heterosexual
also concretely point out the existence of a default category – what I will call
here a default ‘h-sexual’ orientation. That default category would be the one
that does not circulate in discourse – which in this case is the word
heterosexual itself. That would be the category one does not talk about. It
simply is. And it so much is that callers reveal not knowing what that word
actually means. They simply know it is an h-sexual word. The interactions
show, however, that when an h-sexual word is indeed produced in discourse,
when it becomes ‘tellable’ or ‘reportable’ (e.g. ‘my cousin is heterosexual’), it
must mean the ‘other’ category; the category one is not (e.g. ‘I’m not a lesbian
or anything of that kind’) nor wants to be (e.g. ‘thanks god’). Because it is
taken as a default sexual orientation, and perhaps because it is not an
ecological term used by members of that community (i.e. members might use
words that are more colloquial such as straight to refer to heterosexuals), the
word heterosexual does not circulate in discourse. Consequently, it ends up
being understood as the h-sexual word refering to the ‘reportable’ sexual
orientations; i.e. the ‘other’ one or ones.
Such findings pose some important considerations for the discussion of the
theme of this Special Issue, and for what one can learn from the global South
(Comaroff and Comaroff 2012a, 2012b) or, in this case, from the ‘margins’
(Milani 2014). In particular, they bring to light an important topic raised by
Gunkel (2010) when discussing female sexuality in South Africa: the
‘invention’ of western sexual identity terms or what Connell (2007: 218)
claims to be the research terminology getting ‘exported from the metropole to
the periphery’. The analysis highlights the fact that the long-term and always
enlarging academic theorizations and political activism about language,
gender and sexuality do not seem to have yet reached an important slice of the
population: the less economically and educationally privileged groups at the
margins – here, the users of this government toll free number, who rely on a
helpline for health information exactly because they cannot access it
elsewhere.
The callers to this helpline (who are the respondents of the survey) disclose
not being familiar with what academics and activists have taken as everyday,
basic or, perhaps, ‘universal’ terms. In fact, users of the toll free number also
demonstrate not to be able to distinguish how sexual orientations in general
are named. However, that obviously does not mean that a diversity of sexual
practices and orientations are not part of their everyday lives. Upon being faced
with a situation of ‘sexual illiteracy’, call takers (those who conduct the
survey) end up playing another role in these interactions: the role of
‘educating’ callers, even though in very crude, heteronormative, and, just as
important, colonizing ways, about how the callers’ should name their own
sexual identities (e.g. ‘then you are heterosexual, mam’).
Similarly towhat is described by Gunkel (2010) in relation to sexuality in South
Africa, it seems that words and concepts about sexuality in the Brazilian context
are not simply equivalent tomere universalized translations of sexual orientations,
whichexplains the title of this paper, ‘Whose language?Whose sexualities?’7What
this analysis reveals, thus, also calls for the need for the deconstruction of
supposedly universal terms; it calls for a more bottom-up, locally emerged and
ecologically valid description of sexual orientations – ways that are locally used
and understood. It requires a language that actually comes from the ‘margins’
(Milani2014), fromwhere it is actually spoken.Thus, if a ‘theory fromthe South’ is
not, as Comaroff and Comaroff (2012a) contend, any grand theory, but more of a
grounded theory based on encounters with human practices, then investigations
of localunderstandings of sexuality should also – and firstly – be done in encounters
‘with grounded human practices’ (Comaroff and Comaroff 2012b: para. 2) and ‘in
places where we have not classically thought to look’ (2012b: para. 2), like
everyday interactions, where the actual discursive practices and displays of
understandings of human sexuality take place.
