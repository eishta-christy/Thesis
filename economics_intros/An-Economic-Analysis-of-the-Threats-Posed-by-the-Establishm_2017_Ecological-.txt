1. Introduction

Aedes albopictus is the most invasive mosquito in the world
(Medlock et al., 2012). It is an aggressive biter, active all-day long
(Caglioti et al., 2013) and feeds on humans and a variety of other verte-
brate hosts. It is relatively long lived and lays its desiccation resistant
eggs in natural and artiﬁcial containers (Charrel et al., 2007; Pardigon,
2009). Originally of Asian origin, it is now widely distributed across Eu-
rope, Africa, the Americas and the Paciﬁc (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007). It has
recently colonized the islands of the Torres Strait (Ritchie et al., 2006)
where a limited control program costs over AU$1 M per annum
(Muzari, 2015).
Ae. albopictus is a vector of more than 20 arboviruses, is recognised
as a secondary vector of dengue (Bonizzoni et al., 2014; Gratz, 2004;
Lambrechts et al., 2010) and is the major vector of many recent
chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreaks including the La Reunion epi-
demic (200,000 cases and 203 deaths: Renault et al., 2007). In that in-
stance, a single point mutation within the CHIKV genome led to a
dramatic increase in transmissibility by this mosquito. Aedes albopictus,
at least in a laboratory context, is also capable of transmitting four major
Australian endemic arboviruses; Murray Valley encephalitis virus
(MVEV), West Nile virus Kunjin strain (KUNV), Ross River virus (RRV),
and Barmah Forest virus (BFV) (Nicholson et al., 2014c).

Ae. albopictus now has a signiﬁcant urban presence around the globe
(Caglioti et al., 2013; Medlock et al., 2012; Powers and Logue, 2007;
Rezza et al., 2007; Tsetsarkin et al., 2007; Weaver and Barrett, 2004)
and, in some settings, feeds almost exclusively on humans (Ponlawat
and Harrington, 2005). In those instances, Ae. albopictus can transmit vi-
ruses with a human reservoir (i.e. dengue, chikungunya) very efﬁciently
(Weaver and Barrett, 2004).
Ae. albopictus is likely to assume an increasingly prominent role in
the transmission of human arboviruses in the future. Australia is made
vulnerable to that threat by a busy transport and travel network that
links it to regions where both Ae albopictus and the diseases it transmits
are endemic. Exotic mosquito incursions at Australia's ports are on the
increase (van den Hurk et al., 2016) as are the number of imported
cases of viruses such as dengue (Huang et al., 2016). In 2016, Ae.
albopictus was responsible for a dengue outbreak on the island of Darn-
ley (Erub) in the Australian Torres Strait. This is the ﬁrst Ae albopictus-
mediated dengue outbreak in Australian history.

Models indicate that Ae. albopictus could spread along the entire
eastern seaboard of Australia (Benedict et al., 2007; Hales et al., 2002;
Naish et al., 2014; Rochlin et al., 2013; Russell et al., 2009), and we pro-
pose that Queensland is especially vulnerable to its establishment be-
cause of the plethora of suburban areas and parklands that currently
harbor high densities of two native container breeding mosquitoes:
Ae. aegypti and Ae. notoscriptus. These mosquitoes have similar ecologies
to Ae. albopictus (Ritchie et al., 2001), and a number of papers discuss
the overlap of their habitat (Nicholson et al., 2014a) and the potential
displacement of native species by the more aggressive Ae. albopictus
(van den Hurk et al., 2016). A recent household survey in Brisbane
found that 26.2% of all premises surveyed harbored Ae. notoscriptus
(Trewin et al., 2013). That suggests that an Ae. albopictus invasion
might result in universal urban coverage (Fig. 1). Experiences in Europe
and the USA suggest that Ae. albopictus will become an extreme nui-
sance and increase the demand for mosquito control services. It is likely
to incur large economic and societal costs (Benedict et al., 2007;
Caminade et al., 2012; Rochlin et al., 2013).

The establishment of Ae. albopictus in new areas with human popu-
lations unaccustomed to aggressive day biting mosquitoes can impact
the use of outdoor recreational space (Halasa et al., 2012; Halasa et al.,
2014; Manica et al., 2016; Worobey et al., 2013).

Early detection and the timeliness of the emergency response are
critical for containing or eliminating an incursion or limiting the scale
and rate of establishment. Economic analyses of early detection or
long term control programs would give the councils and state govern-
ment some estimate of the potential economic cost of an Ae. albopictus
invasion and the opportunity to assess the readiness of their control
programs. In Queensland, the surveillance and control of exotic mosqui-
to incursions is a responsibility partly shared by the Department of Ag-
riculture and Water Resources (port areas only) and the public health
units that are attached to local, state-funded health services. The bulk
of the management of established nuisance or disease-vector species
is, however, largely the responsibility of local councils. The exception
to this is the control program for Ae. aegypti in those areas of tropical
North Queensland that experience regular dengue outbreaks and that
are at increased risk from other viruses such as chikungunya (CHIKV)
and Zika. That program is almost exclusively conducted by public health
units, attached to local hospital and health services (Queensland Health,
2015).

The most thorough economic analysis of Ae. albopictus is from New
Jersey, USA (Crans et al., 1996). Halasa et al. (2012) estimated that
New Jersey residents valued an enhanced mosquito control program
at almost 4 times its actual cost and Shepard et al. (2014) estimated
that the area-wide integrated pest management of mosquitoes over a
13-week New Jersey summer facilitated an extra 43 h of yard and
porch time by the local populace. Each adult resident in that community
valued those extra hours at US$355.82 per annum. Here, we have car-
ried out a beneﬁt-cost analysis (BCA) with costs estimated from a
Queensland consultation document: the “Exotic mosquito incursion
emergency response framework” (Appendix 1). This document outlines
the magnitude of resources that may be required to mount an elimina-
tion campaign against a limited Ae. albopictus invasion in Brisbane. In
combination with a beneﬁts transfer (BT) estimate derived from the
New Jersey work, we have used that framework to elicit the costs and
beneﬁts of eliminating, or living with, this global invader.
<Middle> Methods.
2.1. Estimating Economic Beneﬁts of Ae. albopictus-free Outdoor Recrea-
tional Activities.
We conduct an ex ante BCA which is the appropriate form of BCA
when a policy is considered prior to being implemented. Ex ante BCA in-
forms government, industry and the wider community as to whether
scarce resources should be allocated to a potential project or policy.
The analysis is undertaken from the perspective of the community in
Queensland (i.e. social BCA). The beneﬁts and costs to the state govern-
ment and the wider community and stakeholders in Queensland are
assessed, and the counterfactual used is the ‘do nothing’ option. We fol-
low the BCA framework outlined in Boardman et al. (2006).

For this BCA, we considered three scenarios: 1) an environment with
no Ae. albopictus, 2) a limited incursion of Ae. albopictus that is met with
an elimination response and 3) an incursion of Ae. albopictus that, be-
cause of failure to eliminate, becomes established throughout Brisbane.
We stress that these scenarios are not part of current policy by state or
local governments. They simply represent potential scenarios under dis-
cussion by Queensland stakeholders with responsibilities and expertise
in mosquito management. An overall schematic illustrating the general
cost categories can be found in Fig. 2.

We calculated the beneﬁts and costs of the following scenarios: 1)
the beneﬁts of having no Ae. albopictus in terms of the value of mosqui-
to-free recreational activities, 2) the costs and beneﬁts of eliminating Ae.
albopictus and 3) the cost of establishment that result from i) additional
complaints to councils about a mosquito nuisance and ii) the need to
mount a public health (i.e. vector control) response to imported cases
of dengue, chikungunya or Zika).

We used the beneﬁt transfer (BT) methodology (Hanley et al., 2009)
to transfer values from New Jersey (Horwood et al., 2013) surveys to
Brisbane (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2013). Halasa et al. (2014) es-
timated New Jersey residents were willing to pay US$9.48 ± $9.48 per
person per week for an additional recreational mosquito-free hour.
We used the same method used in Shepard et al. (2014) and calculated
annual beneﬁts by multiplying the weekly beneﬁt by 13 to represent a
13-week New Jersey summer.

To convert this to Brisbane dollars in 2016, we further estimated the
per capita WTP in terms of dollar values from 2010 (when the survey
was carried out). We adjusted for inﬂation to obtain the beneﬁts in
2016 US$ using a cumulative inﬂation rate of 10.4% between 2010 and
2016 (Coin News Media Group LLC, 2014). We adjusted for differential
GDP per capita between New Jersey and Queensland using per capita
GDP for 2012 (nominal values) (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2013;
US Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2013). We used a 1.33 exchange rate
(Australia dollar to US dollars), to report the beneﬁt values in 2016 Aus-
tralian dollars (Converter, 2016). Finally, we multiplied the result by
0.50 to reﬂect a recent survey ﬁnding that 50% of Brisbane residents
would be unwilling to pay any amount for additional Ae. albopictus con-
trol (Mwebaze et al., 2017).

2.2. Deﬁnitions of the Three Ae. albopictus Control Scenarios.
2.2.1. Scenario 1: No Ae. albopictus Present.
This is the baseline scenario. No control is needed and residents
avoid the costs of management or establishment.
2.2.2. Scenario 2: Elimination Response to an Isolated Detection.
This hypothetical elimination strategy (Appendix 1, “Mosquito In-
cursion Emergency Response Framework”) provides stakeholders
with an estimate of the resources required to eliminate a local incursion
of Ae. albopictus. This kind of document is critical to drafting inter-agen-
cy plans that deﬁne roles, logistics and methodology. The proposed re-
sponse is based on the discovery of one or more premises within a
single urban block that are harbouring one or more exotic larvae,
pupae, or adults. An eradication zone (EZ) (Rezza et al., 2007) with a ra-
dius of 500 m is created around those premises, consisting of the detec-
tion block, an inner ring and an outer ring (Appendix 1). Source
reduction and comprehensive insecticidal treatments are implemented
within the EZ (Appendix 1). This involves the destruction of the aquatic
habitat (e.g. destroying, discarding or upturning containers that may
collect water), the application of residual adulticides to all containers
that cannot be treated in this way, the application of larvicides to sites
such as roof gutters, rainwater tanks and subterranean sites, and the
mass deployment of lethal ovitraps. Areas within the detection block
and inner ring that are likely to harbor adult resting mosquitoes (e.g.
shades walls and leaf litter, fences and low lying dense vegetation)
will also be sprayed with residual adulticides (Muzari et al., 2014). We
conservatively estimate that all premises in the EZ will require harbor-
age treatment. We have costed a scenario where harbourage treatment
is subcontracted to private pest control companies at an estimated cost
of A$250 per yard (G. Cochrane, personal communication).

The response also requires a signiﬁcant amount of surveillance with-
in and beyond the borders of the eradication zone to deﬁne the limits of
the incursion and enable the adjustment of the EZ if appropriate. We as-
sume that post-intervention surveillance will continue 12 weeks after
the last detection to verify the elimination. Surveillance tools, for exam-
ple BioGents sentinel® (Williams et al., 2006) or gravid Aedes traps
(GATs) (Eiras et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2016) would be deployed in
this effort and are fully costed.

The control and surveillance responses would be conducted in part-
nership between the health department and local government, as
outlined under the Queensland Dengue Management Plan 2015–2020
(Queensland Health, 2015).

The eradication strategy assigns stafﬁng to reﬂect various activities
and, in its current form, requires 33 staff (Table 1). The costing includes
half of the surveillance and control teams being sourced from North
Queensland (e.g. Cairns, Townsville etc.) where vector control staff rou-
tine control for Ae. aegypti, in order to mitigate the lack of experience
staff in Brisbane may have managing container-breeding mosquitoes.
For these staff, ﬂights, accommodation and per diem are included as
part of the costs (Appendix 3). Surveillance and control activities will
continue as long as Ae. albopictus continues to be detected. The elimina-
tion strategy for the block includes a repeat inspection for mosquitoes
and a ﬁnal treatment after the last detection.

To incorporate uncertainty in our cost estimations, three infestation
levels were chosen to generate “low”, “central” and “high” cost
estimates (Table 2) based on the number of premises in an eradication
zone (Appendix 1). We assume a local incursion as opposed to a wide-
spread establishment. The “low” and “high” estimates were the mini-
mum and maximum estimated number of premises, respectively,
while the “central” estimate was the mean value. Based on a conserva-
tive estimate that one 3-person vector control team can treat 12 pre-
mises in one working day, we estimate that four 3-person teams will
treat 240 premises per working week. In any case, treatments of blocks
or limited areas need to be completed within no more than 6 weeks as
that is the expected residual life of the adulticides applied to containers
and harbourage areas.

2.2.3. Scenario 3: Establishment of Ae. albopictus with Increased Nuisance
Complaints and Vector-borne Disease Risk.
2.2.3.1. Increased Nuisance Complaints. Brisbane City council has a state-
of-the-art larviciding operation for control of the saltmarsh and fresh-
water mosquitoes that commonly plague Brisbane residents (Dale et
al., 2008). It does not, however, routinely manage mosquitoes around
private residences, where container breeding mosquitoes such as Ae.
albopictus will be most abundant (Unlu et al., 2013).

The current strategy is to respond to complaints about domestic
mosquito nuisance with information about mosquito biology and advice
on personal protection. In some cases, adult traps are set at the premises
to determine the mosquito species involved. The spatial and temporal
focus of this limited response is driven by telephone complaints made
to the local council by homeowners approximately 90% are dealt with
by telephone and the mosquitoes in question are most commonly iden-
tiﬁed as saltmarsh (e.g. Ae. vigilax) or freshwater (e.g. Culex
annulirostris) mosquitoes hatching and dispersing after high tides or
rain. Where the source of mosquitoes is not clear, a council ofﬁcer visits
the residence to identify the nuisance mosquitoes and advise the
homeowner. In a few cases, adulticiding (i.e. harbourage spraying) is
carried out, usually in high proﬁle locations (e.g. retirement homes)
(Mike Muller, Brisbane City Council, personal communication). As in
other parts of the world, the establishment of Ae. albopictus in Brisbane
will lead to an increased number of complaints and increased council
activity in response. To estimate the potential costs of these events,
we estimated the time and resources an ofﬁcer spends on the phone
and carrying out trapping activities and engagement with residents.

In the absence of historical data for complaints to Brisbane City
Council, we used annual numbers of complaints to Gold Coast City
Council as a proxy (D. Allaway, unpublished) from 1996 to 2012 (Ap-
pendix 2) to estimate the number of additional complaints due to Ae.
albopictus. Using those numbers of cases as a proxy, we chose 115 (min-
imum number of complaints), 332 (median number), and 1162 (maxi-
mum number) as the low, center and high estimates, respectively.

2.2.3.2. Public Health Response. In Queensland, it is public health practice
to implement a vector control response wherever there is a risk of mos-
quito-borne disease transmission. Currently, there is no competent
vector for dengue, chikungunya or Zika in the greater Brisbane area.
Therefore, no response to imported cases is required. Fig. 3 shows that
there are currently around 60 imported cases of dengue and
chikungunya to Brisbane, reﬂecting the same steady increase in
viraemic imports that has occurred across Australia in recent years:
the result of an expanding global travel network and the ongoing arbo-
virus epidemics in Asia, the Paciﬁc and the Americas (Huang et al.,
2016). If Ae. albopictus becomes established in mainland Australia,
imported dengue, chikungunya or Zika cases will trigger a vector con-
trol response as recommended in the Dengue and Chikungunya Man-
agement Plans (Queensland Health, 2014; Queensland Health, 2015).
Zones of at least 150 m around the case house will be treated as per Sce-
nario 2. Similar responses will be required around other addresses visit-
ed by the viraemic case while infectious and where there is potential
exposure to mosquitoes.

In general, an average of 3 contact addresses will be treated. Based
on the information in Fig. 2, we assume that between 7 and 77 cases
per year will require vector control due to the widespread presence of
Ae. albopictus (derived from cases per 100,000 and the Brisbane popula-
tion for any given year). We estimate that team of 3 vector control ofﬁ-
cers will require 1 week to treat all of the properties at risk from an
imported case (J. Davis, personal communication), and have assumed
personnel costs for 4 teams (12 ofﬁcers) based on this rate. One notable
difference from the existing dengue response in Cairns (Ritchie et al.,
2002) that the indoor residual spraying required for control of Ae.
aegypti is replaced by harbourage spraying in order to target the largely
outdoor-resting habits of Ae. albopictus (Muzari et al., 2017; Muzari,
2015).

2.3. Estimated Cost of Ae. albopictus Control Scenarios.
We estimated the cost of the three Ae. albopictus scenarios in Bris-
bane following a similar method as Shepard et al. (2014) carried out
in New Jersey. The cost of these strategies consisted of three general cat-
egories of expenditure: personnel, recurrent costs, and capital costs. We
used a “mosquito control costing tool” to calculated expenses for each
control scenario (see Appendix 3 for example of mosquito elimination
cost calculations).

Personnel costs reﬂect salaries and employee fringe beneﬁts paid by
the institution (employer contributions to health insurance, superannu-
ation, etc.) for full- and part-time employees or hourly wages and ben-
eﬁts paid to seasonal or contracted workers recruited to implement the
strategy. We multiplied the gross salary by the percentage of effort that
each person devoted to the control effort. Additional personnel costs
were added according to each strategy's need (transport, accommoda-
tion, and mandated per diems). The costing includes half of the surveil-
lance and control teams being sourced from North Queensland (e.g.

Cairns, Townsville, etc.), where vector control staff routinely control
for Ae. aegypti, in order to mitigate the lack of experience staff in Bris-
bane may have managing container-breeding mosquitoes. For these
staff, ﬂights, accommodation and per diem costs are included as part
of the personnel costs.

Recurrent costs included insecticides (larvicides and adulticides),
sub-contracts to pest control companies, vehicle rental, protective
clothing and accessories, and laboratory materials.

“Capital costs” refers to equipment with a useful life of more than
1 year. We estimated the annual economic cost for each item and amor-
tized the cost according to its useful life. We estimated the item's usage
share by the Ae. albopictus control strategy and multiplied the amortized
cost by that percentage. Total capital costs for all items were derived.
The useful life of any one item was obtained from the Australia's Depart-
ment of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Services (Internal Revenue
Services, 2013). Under our hypothetical Ae. albopictus elimination
framework, 100% of the usage will be for the Ae. albopictus program.

2.3.1. Assumptions and Exclusions.
We do not consider the costs of detections of Ae. albopictus at air and
seaports. These are the responsibility of Australian Government Depart-
ment of Agriculture and Water Resources (DAWR) quarantine and
biosecurity effort, and those costs are outside the boundary of the pres-
ent BCA. Our estimates of the resources required to meet the recom-
mendations of our strategy are based upon expert consultation with
resource managers and mosquito control researchers. The strategy has
also been reviewed and commented on by the Aedes albopictus Eradica-
tion Programme Technical Advisory Group (TAG) which is made up of
individuals with signiﬁcant operational experience of mosquito control
and eradication and which is responsible for oversight of Australia's Ae.
albopictus quarantine program in the Torres Strait (which aims to limit
Ae. albopictus numbers in the main transport hubs of the Torres Strait
and minimize the risks of mainland incursions from that source (van
den Hurk et al., 2016; Muzari et al., 2017)). It is our contention that
any reduction in the numbers of personnel dedicated to these strategies
would lengthen the time needed to complete the eradication response,
compromise the likelihood of containment and increase the chances of
disease transmission.

The analysis excludes the costs of implementing any incident man-
agement framework or the costs of community engagement, media,
data management (software or personnel), ofﬁce administration, train-
ing (with the exception of pest management licenses in public health
sustained response plan), fuel, site hire, contractor hire (beyond pest
control operators used in eradication responses) or diagnostics (e.g.
molecular taxonomy for identiﬁcation of Ae. albopictus). Costs of main-
taining essential capital resources (e.g. tools and equipment) in the ab-
sence of an Ae. albopictus control campaign were not considered. Any
beneﬁts accruing from the recovery of outdoor recreational time that
might result from the public health response are not considered.

This analysis includes the cost of 3 months of post-intervention sur-
veillance and assumes no additional Ae. albopictus are detected. It is ex-
pected that after a successful intervention, at least one year of surveys
would necessarily be carried out to conﬁrm that the area remained
free of Ae. albopictus (Appendix 1). This analysis did not include the
costs of that long-term surveillance.

We based our calculations off of previous beneﬁt and costs estimates
of Ae. albopictus that assume a 13 week New Jersey summer (Shepard et
al., 2014). Since Brisbane is warmer than New Jersey, it is expected that
Ae. albopictus will be active for a longer period.

2.4. Beneﬁt-cost Analysis.
Fig. 3. Imported cases of Ae. albopictus-transmitted viruses (dengue, chikungunya and
Zika) per 100,000 in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, from 1996 to 2014. Data provided
by Notiﬁable Conditions Systems (NOCS), Queensland Department of Health.

For the BCA, we divided the cost of each strategy by the population of
Brisbane to get a per capita estimate (Queensland Treasury and Trade,
2013). To estimate the beneﬁt cost ratio (BCR) we divided the per capita
beneﬁt by the per capita cost. To estimate the net beneﬁt per capita we
subtract the beneﬁt per capita from the cost per capita.

2.4.1. Sensitivity Analysis.
Risk and uncertainty are always associated with predictions about
future beneﬁts and costs and should be incorporated in the BCA
(Campbell and Brown, 2003). As the BCA is being undertaken in ad-
vance of a potential invasion that is yet to occur (i.e. ex ante BCA), our
numerical estimates of the key variables used in our analysis are not
known with certainty. In acknowledgment of this, a sensitivity analysis
and Monte Carlo simulation were conducted to test the robustness of
the results for changes in major variables. We performed a Monte
Carlo simulation by using probability distributions to describe and iden-
tify the most inﬂuential variables of the 88 variables used to calculate
our forecast (BCR). We speciﬁed a triangular probability distribution
for most of the key variables in the model such as the estimate of the
WTP in New Jersey and the proportion of the Brisbane population that
would be willing to contribute to mosquito control (Table 3). Using
Crystal Ball software, a Monte Carlo simulation was run, whereby the
forecast beneﬁts and BCR of the proposed program were recalculated
10,000 times, each time using a different, randomly chosen set of values
for the input variables (see Appendix 3 spreadsheet; all variables con-
tributing to cost model are highlighted in green).

3. Results.
3.1. Estimation of Beneﬁts.
For an example of calculations, in this case for the central estimate
(Table 2), see Appendix 3. After taking the initial estimate of US$9.48
(Halasa et al., 2014) multiplying by the GDP adjustment (New Jersey
2012 to Brisbane 2012) of 0.84, multiplying by the cumulative inﬂation
rate (2010 to 2016) of 10.4% and multiplying by the currency exchange
rate ($US to $AU, 29 August 2016) of 1.32557, the result was a per capita
WTP per week of AU$136.06. After adjusting by 50% of Brisbane resi-
dents unwilling to pay for additional mosquito control (Mwebaze et
al., 2017) and multiplying by a 13 week New Jersey summer, the result
is AU$75.81 per person per year.

3.2. Scenario 1: No Ae. albopictus Present.
The per capita beneﬁt associated with additional time enjoying out-
door activities (e.g. yard and porch activities) without mosquitoes was
estimated at AU$75.81 (Table 4) after accounting for an estimated 50%
of Brisbane residents unwilling to pay for additional mosquito control
(Mwebaze et al., 2017). In the absence of Ae. albopictus, this beneﬁt is
present with no additional cost.

3.3. Scenario 2: Elimination Response to an Isolated Detection.
The most likely cost of an Ae. albopictus eradication strategy follow-
ing a single detection outside an international port of entry was estimat-
ed at AU$1,233,244 (Table 5). The main assumptions used are as
follows: The detection event is conﬁned to one urban block, the inter-
vention is successful without the need to repeat treatment, operations
are implemented according to protocol (Appendix 1) and the exercise
ends after two further months of surveillance and control. No further
detections result. See Appendix 3 for a sample worksheet showing the
calculation of cost estimates.

The allocation of cost differs slightly by the estimated size of the initial
infestation. For a minimal infestation (low estimate), personnel costs are
expected to comprise 69% of the cost, and recurrent costs (larvicides,
subcontract for barrier spraying, dry ice for light traps) would take up
approximately 29%. In the central and high estimates, however, the recur-
rent costs take up an increasingly larger fraction of the total (Table 5).

The most likely per capita cost of this strategy was AU$1.07 for Bris-
bane resulting in a BCR of 50–78 (Table 3). For each AU$1 spent on the
Ae. albopictus eradication strategy, Brisbane residents gained additional
outdoor recreational time worth over AU$49 (the range calculated by
uncertainty analysis can be found in Appendix 4).

The Monte Carlo analysis indicates that four variables contribute to
variance in the BCR: per capita WTP of New Jersey residents (50.2%),
willingness to pay estimates of Brisbane households (44.3%), the Bris-
bane population (2.4%) and the per capita GDP in Queensland (2.2%)
(Fig. 4).

3.4. Scenario 3: Establishment of Ae. albopictus with Increased Nuisance
Complaints and Vector-borne Disease Risk.
In this scenario, Ae. albopictus is established in Brisbane without pos-
sibility of eradication, so the beneﬁt of an environment free of Ae.
albopictus is lost.

3.4.1. Response to Additional Nuisance Complaints from Ae. albopictus.
The cost associated with responses to complaints is estimated to
range from $17,382–$59,785 per year depending on the number of ad-
ditional complaints (Table 6).

3.4.2. Response to Disease Risk.
Control measures will be as described in 2.2.3.2. See Appendix 5 for a
sample worksheet for calculation of cost estimates. The purpose of this
intervention is to prevent local transmission and outbreaks of arboviral
diseases transmitted by Ae. albopictus. Using the imported case data in
Fig. 3, we estimated costs based on the minimum, median and maxi-
mum numbers of cases recorded during that period (33, 74 and 137, re-
spectively; Table 7). The calculation of the potential beneﬁts of this
intervention (i.e. impact on earnings, health services, hospital admis-
sions etc.) is beyond the scope of this analysis.

In summary, the total annual costs of an Ae. albopictus establishment
in Brisbane would be AU$0.54–AU$1.30 per capita, with an additional
loss of the beneﬁts associated with an environment free of Ae. albopictus
(AU$75.81 per capita; see section 3.1). In comparison, the costs of a suc-
cessful elimination effort would cost AU$0.97–AU$1.51 and the value of
an Ae. albopictus free environment would be preserved (Table 8).

<Conclusion> Discussion.
Current predictive models suggest that Ae. albopictus could establish
in all population centres in Australia (Nicholson et al., 2014b). In urban
environments it exploits aquatic habitats typical of those used by native
container breeding mosquitoes (Li et al., 2014; Nicholson et al., 2014a).
In Southeast Queensland, the commonest of these is Ae. notoscriptus
which, in a recent greater Brisbane survey of households, had an almost
universal distribution (Heersink et al., 2015). It is reasonable to assume
that Ae. albopictus would utilize these same ecological niches as Ae.
notoscriptus and that it would occupy an almost identical distribution.
Evidence suggests the presence of Ae. notoscriptus would not be a com-
petitive obstacle to Ae. albopictus (Nicholson et al., 2014a), resulting in
the establishment of a mosquito that is anthropophilic, pestiferous
and a potential vector of over 20 arboviruses including dengue,
chikungunya and Zika (Benedict et al., 2007). Moreover, wherever it
has established outside of its native Asian range, it has caused consider-
able disruption to outdoor recreational activities (Halasa et al., 2014;
Unlu et al., 2013). This is particularly pertinent in Australian cities like
Brisbane whose climate and culture encourages the populace to social-
ize and exercise outdoors (Pettigrew, 2002).

The beneﬁts that would accrue from eliminating Ae. albopictus, pre-
serving the value of a recreational environment free of this mosquito
and averting the costs of a post-establishment nuisance and public
health response are considerable under the assumptions of our analysis.
Every dollar spent on a successful elimination campaign results in at
least AU$50 in beneﬁt. That beneﬁt is ongoing, year on year, as a result
of protecting Brisbane's outdoor recreational space.

Our analysis is based on the assumption that the eradication frame-
work is effective and that if such a strategy were not implemented, the
mosquito would spread throughout Brisbane. These assumptions are
not unreasonable – our elimination response is aimed at a very limited
incursion that could be extinguished by a well-resourced mosquito con-
trol and surveillance campaign. We have not costed the long-term com-
mitment to surveillance that would be required after such an incursion
and our response assumes that a citywide surveillance network is al-
ready in place (if it were not, the incursion would not be discovered in
the ﬁrst place). This is a key point – without surveillance, Ae. albopictus
will enter Brisbane unchallenged. By the time it is discovered, it will be
widespread and impossible to tackle. The value of an Ae. albopictus-free
environment will be lost.

Eradication may not be successful in the estimated timeframe—for
example, the Ae. aegypti eradication programs in the Northern Territory
of Australia took two years and 5 rounds of control before declared suc-
cessful (Kurucz and Pettit, 2014; Whelan et al., 2009). Supposing that
costs of elimination were 10 times higher than estimated and
there were two “high estimate” Ae. albopictus incursions in the
summer, then the beneﬁts of scenario 2 would be just one twenti-
eth (i.e. 1/10 × 1/2) of the amounts projected here. Even so, the BCR
would still be favourable: 2.5 to 1 instead of 50 to 1. Early intervention
is clearly comparatively inexpensive in comparison with the costs of
incursion. Further, the yearly beneﬁt was based on a 13 week New
Jersey summer. The Brisbane summer is longer, so the beneﬁts would
be expected to extend further throughout the year.

The costs of intervention are largely similar to those associated with
the eradication of an ecologically similar species, Ae. aegypti, from loca-
tions in Australia's Northern Territory. Our elimination framework con-
siders that the infestation ranges between 500 and 150 households. In
the Northern Territory in 2004, 91 out of 1137 (approximately 8%)
properties surveyed in Tennant Creek were positive for Ae. aegypti
(Whelan et al., 2005). On Groote Eylandt, 45 out of 445 (approximately
10.1%) properties were found to be positive for Ae. aegypti (Kulback and
Whelan, 2007). Both infestations took roughly two years to eliminate
(Nguyen et al., 2009; Whelan et al., 2012) at a cost of approximately
1.3 M AUD for Tennant Creek (P. Whelan, unpublished data), and ap-
proximately AU$750,000 for Groote Eylandt (Whelan et al., 2009).
Tennant Creek was reinfested again in 2012, with the initial survey ﬁnd-
ing 146 out of 1070 (1.4%) properties positive for Ae. aegypti (Whelan et
al., 2012), though no additional detections were made since 2013
(Kurucz and Pettit, 2014). This demonstrates that by the time an infes-
tation is discovered, it may have become widespread. In the case of Ae.
albopictus in Brisbane, that would result in a considerably larger eradica-
tion zone and more properties needing to be surveyed and treated.
Since 68% of the estimated cost is for personnel, increasing the time
taken to carry out the eradication will increase the cost substantially.

Establishment in Brisbane has an estimated cost of AU$0.52-
AU$1.25 per capita per annum for the public health response that
would be triggered by the appearance of a mosquito vector associated
with dengue, chikungunya and Zika transmission. This may be an un-
derestimate as we assume that the responses are successful and do
not result in further cases (triggering further responses and costs).
These costs are relatively modest as they only cover the expense of a
response. In reality, regular imports might require a permanent team.
For example, the permanent, public-health afﬁliated, vector control
team based in Cairns, North Queensland (the Dengue Action Response
Team or DART; (Ritchie et al., 2002)) costs approximately AU$5 per
capita per year (Devine and Muzari, 2013). During the 2009 dengue ep-
idemic in Cairns, there were 931 conﬁrmed cases and one death. Each
case cost Queensland Health approximately US$3547, and the outbreak
cost more than US$3 M (Vazquez-Prokopec et al., 2010).

The DART also carries out the Ae. albopictus control program in the
Torres Strait (van den Hurk et al., 2016). Approximately 750 properties
and their surrounds, on Horn and Thursday Islands are targeted. Adult
mosquito resting habitats (mostly leaf litter under dense stands of veg-
etation around and between houses) are treated with a residual
insecticide applied by backpack mist-blowers and a tractor-mounted
sprayer, as well as treating all potential breeding sites in all yards and
gardens by either destroying the container, placing it under cover or
treating it with insecticides (synthetic pyrethroid spray or methoprene
pellets). This is a demonstrably successful approach (van den Hurk et al.,
2016 Muzari et al., 2017), and the one on which our elimination frame-
work for Brisbane is based. It should be noted that the existing Torres
Strait strategy keeps Ae. albopictus numbers to close to the limits of de-
tection but has not resulted in elimination. By the time Ae. albopictus
was discovered in the Torres Strait it was already well established and
resisted any attempt at elimination. There is no permanent vector con-
trol team in the Torres Strait and the control effort consists of regular
well-resourced visits by the DART.

The current response by local Queensland councils to complaints by
individual householders about nuisance biting is minimal. The mosqui-
toes that trigger these complaints are almost always saltmarsh and
freshwater mosquitoes, dispersing in large numbers after tidal or rain-
fall events. These mosquitoes are largely active for brief periods during
the evenings, although their sheer numbers can present a considerable
biting nuisance. These species are the main target of local government
control programs in south east Queensland – and the control effort fo-
cuses on their coastal, rural and peri-urban breeding habitats. These
mosquitoes cannot be effectively controlled by domestic interventions.
As a result of this, complaints by individual householders are usually
ﬁelded by telephone calls that simply offer advice on personal protec-
tion and house screening, thus the estimated nuisance cost due to addi-
tional service requests due to Ae. albopictus increases by AU$17,382 to
AU$59,785 per year.

As an illustration, in 2013–2014 most householder complaints to the
Brisbane City Council came from regions near coastal saltmarsh areas
(Fig. 4), where Ae. vigilax is the primary nuisance mosquito. The suburbs
with the highest number of complaints (levels 7–10, see Fig. 5) repre-
sent approximately 5% of the Brisbane population. If Ae albopictus
were to establish as an urban container-breeder in Brisbane, all areas
will be at risk of feeling the impacts of this new aggressive biter, and
the public demand for an intervention may well increase. This is a
day-biting mosquito, commonly biting outdoors. It can assume very
high densities in some areas and dramatically impact on people's use
of outdoor spaces (Carrieri et al., 2008; Tsuda and Kim, 2012). In coastal
Florida, a region similar to Southeast Queensland in terms of climate
and recreational activity, saltmarsh mosquitoes also used to be the
commonest cause of complaints. However, following its establishment
in 1986 (O'Meara et al., 1993), various mosquito control managers in
that state now estimate that Ae. albopictus is the origin of 12–50% of
all nuisance complaints (Fig. 6).

If Ae. albopictus were to become established in an area like Brisbane
which currently has no competent dengue, chikungunya or Zika vector,
it would demand a public health response to imported viraemias. At
its simplest this might cost AU$604,301–AU$1,444,453 per annum
(Table 7).

A successful surveillance and elimination plan not only prevents ad-
ditional pressure on local governments to respond to nuisance mosqui-
to, but also protects the population from a dangerous public health risk
and an increasing investment in mitigative vector control capacity. Most
importantly it preserves the recreational value of our outdoor habitat,
with implications for our well-being and our health. One study has
even suggested that an Ae. albopictus invasion can disrupt outdoor activ-
ity to the extent that it may play a role in encouraging childhood obesity
(Worobey et al., 2013). An effective elimination strategy also helps ra-
tionalize and protect our existing efforts to keep mainland Australia
free of Ae. albopictus. The control program in the Torres Strait is justiﬁed,
not only on the basis of protecting the most populous part of the Torres
Strait, but also because it prevents Ae. albopictus from invading the
mainland from that route. Similarly, the Department of Agriculture
and Water Resources spends approximately AU$1.8 M annually on vec-
tor surveillance activities at ﬁrst ports of entry in Australia (Angus Sly,
personal communication). That effort is wasted if there is no comple-
mentary surveillance effort in urban areas, and if there is no plan for
elimination should an exotic mosquito escape the port perimeter. The
costs of surveillance and elimination for disruptive species such as
Ae. albopictus are clearly outweighed by the beneﬁts of avoiding
invasion and establishment, the economics of which we have hypothe-
sized here.

Australia, despite its isolation, has been so far unable to defend itself
against some costly invertebrate invaders. Some of these are historical
(Aedes aegypti) but others include red imported ﬁre ants (Wylie et al.,
2016), cattle ticks (Angus, 1996), wood wasps (Carnegie and Bashford,
2012) and recently Varroa mites. These are associated with $5 billion
to $8 billion in annual damage and control costs. The addition of Ae.
albopictus to that list, and its impact upon a key recreational resource,
would dramatically increase that total.

There are also limitations to this study. Some beneﬁts and costs of
eliminating Ae. albopictus were not quantiﬁed. Excluded costs include
personnel training, community engagement and media costs, vehicle
fuel and mosquito identiﬁcation diagnostics. These costs would be ex-
pected to decrease the BCR, but we conclude that they would have
only a low impact on the BCR. On the other hand, some beneﬁts were
also excluded. Eliminating a potential establishment of Ae. albopictus
will avoid the cost of additional health care for diseases transmitted
by this species that would not have been transmitted in its absence
(e.g. dengue, Zika virus, chikungunya virus). Another excluded beneﬁt
is the additional management of non-Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Barrier
spraying will kill other biting mosquitoes such as Ae. vigilax and Cx.
annulirostris, while treatment of containers around homes will reduce
populations of Ae. notoscriptus while also reducing the probability that
the dengue mosquito Ae. aegypti, which breeds in similar habitats as
Ae. albopictus, will become established in Brisbane. These additional
beneﬁts would increase the BCR.
