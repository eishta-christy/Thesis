1. Introduction

Aquaculture is the world's fastest growing food production technol-
ogy, and in 2014 it surpassed wild ﬁsh as a source of seafood for human
consumption (FAO, 2015). However, aquaculture is also a controversial
food production technology that constitutes a new way of using the en-
vironment, which creates new negative externalities (Naylor et al.,
2000). This has led to a negative perception of aquaculture in many
markets and several studies indicate a consumer preference for wild
ﬁsh (Salladarré et al., 2010; Roheim et al., 2012; Uchida et al., 2014a).
Recently, the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) introduced an
ecolabel certifying that the production process for the labeled ﬁsh is en-
vironmentally sustainable. Using survey data, this study investigates the
effect of the ASC label for salmon, a popular species that is available as
both wild and farmed in Germany. If the ASC label has a positive effect,
it is of particular interest whether this effect is large enough to negate
the disadvantage of not being wild as well as how the ASC compares
with ecolabels for wild ﬁsh such as the Marine Stewardship Council
(MSC) label.

Environmentally sustainable production processes for seafood ini-
tially focused on wild ﬁsh, as many ﬁsheries were perceived to be
over-ﬁshed. This has led to a number of sustainability schemes and
ecolabels being implemented since the turn of the century (Roheim,
2008), with the MSC ecolabel being the most commonly used.1 A num-
ber of studies using revealed or stated preference data show a positive
preference and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for seafood with an ecolabel
that guarantees an environmentally sustainable production process
(Wessells et al., 1999; Johnston et al., 2001; Jaffry et al., 2004;
Johnston and Roheim, 2006; Brécard et al., 2009; Salladarré et al.,
2010; Uchida et al., 2014a, 2014b; Fonner and Sylvia, 2015; Rickertsen
et al., 2017). In addition, studies using hedonic price functions indicate
a positive premium for the ecolabel using scanner or store observation
data (Roheim et al., 2011; Sogn-Grundvåg and Young, 2013;
Sogn-Grundvåg et al., 2013, 2014, Asche et al., 2015a; Bronnmann and
Asche, 2016). Hence, the ecolabels seem to be successful in segmenting
the seafood market into a higher paying sustainably ﬁshed market
segment and a lower priced segment with no guarantees with respect to
environmental sustainability.

Initially, aquaculture was regarded as a production technology that
could reduce over-ﬁshing by reducing demand for and thereby ﬁshing
effort for wild species.2 In the 1990s, Anderson and Bettancourt
(1993), Gu and Anderson (1995) and Holland and Wessells (1998) re-
ported evidence of consumer preferences for farmed ﬁsh. However, as
aquaculture production increased, more attention was given to the neg-
ative environmental effects of the production process, and consumer at-
titudes have shifted to a preference for wild ﬁsh (Salladarré et al., 2010;
Roheim et al., 2012; Uchida et al., 2014a). While this in itself constitutes
a challenge for farmed seafood, the fact that aquaculture and wild sea-
food within a species group are highly substitutable contributes further
to make the MSC label a challenge for farmed seafood.3 There have been
some attempts to mitigate this challenge by labeling farmed seafood as
organic or using best practices labeling (Asche et al., 2015a;
Ankamah-Yeboah et al., 2016).4 However, these are at best half-way
measures since they are only imperfectly addressing the sustainability
concern.

The lack of a serious ecolabel for farmed seafood has become more
apparent as aquaculture production has continued to grow.5 Moreover,
despite environmental challenges in parts of the industry, it is hard to
argue that all aquaculture production is unsustainable (Bush et al.,
2013a). In 2012, the ASC ecolabel was created in cooperation with the
World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which was also the case for the MSC
ecolabel.6 The ASC ecolabel allows ﬁsh farmers to indicate that their
product is sustainably produced with a credible label, and can remove
the potential market advantage the MSC ecolabel gave wild ﬁsh if the
main reason for the preference for wild ﬁsh is environmental concerns.
This paper investigates the preferences of German consumers for
salmon, with a particular focus on the attributes farmed, wild, and
eco-labeled.7 However, factors such as demographics and product
form are controlled for. As recent hedonic price function studies have
shown the type of retail outlet to be important (Asche et al., 2015a;
Bronnmann and Asche, 2016), we will also control for retailer, even in
an experimental setting. The empirical analysis of this study is based
on survey data from 485 respondents carried out in November 2015.
These data are used to estimate a mixed logit model that avoids the
three main limitations of the standard multinomial logit model by
allowing for random taste variation, unrestricted substitution pattern,
and correlation in unobserved factors over time (Hensher et al., 2015).
The estimated parameters are used to compute WTP for the attributes
of the model. While a number of studies focus on the ecolabeling of
wild ﬁsh, to our knowledge the only two studies that consider ecolabels
on farmed ﬁsh are Roheim et al. (2012) and Uchida et al. (2014a), who
investigate, respectively, U.S. and Japanese consumers' WTP for
salmon.8 However, in both cases the ecolabels are hypothetical and
apply to both wild and farmed ﬁsh, rather than the separate labels for
wild and farmed ﬁsh that appear in the market.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section
describes the survey design. The data are then presented in Section 3,
followed by a description of the methods used. Section 4 presents the
results of the mixed logit model, as well as the estimated WTP for the
various product attributes. A summary is provided in Section 5.

2. Background and Survey Design.
Globally, salmon is one of the most successful farmed ﬁsh species in
terms of production growth, and is the farmed species with the second
highest value after shrimp (Smith et al., 2010; Asche et al., 2015b;
Kumar and Engle, 2016).9 In Germany, salmon is one of the most popu-
lar species as measured by market share (FIZ, 2015), and is available
both fresh and frozen. Moreover, the market share of farmed and wild
salmon is approximately 50% (Bronnmann and Asche, 2016). MSC-la-
beled salmon has been available for some years, while ASC salmon has
been available since 2014. By the end of 2015, 1675 salmon products
were available with the ASC label globally; in Germany 130 certiﬁed
salmon products were available. At the same time there were 508
MSC certiﬁed salmon products available at the German market (MSC,
2016).

The empirical analysis of this study is based on a survey conducted at
three different retail stores in northern Germany (located in Kiel and
Kaltenkirchen) during two weeks in November 2015 using a paper-
based questionnaire. The region of the survey is suited for analyzing
consumers' preferences for ﬁsh because the majority of ﬁsh consumers
in Germany are located in the northern states (FIZ, 2015). Prior to the
actual survey, the questionnaire and the choice experiment were
developed and pre-tested using a ten-person focus-group discussion
to ensure the comprehensibility of the questions and the choice sets. Re-
spondents were selected randomly from consumers shopping in the
markets, and were asked for their willingness to participate in a study
by the University of Kiel to investigate consumers' preferences regarding
farmed and sustainable ﬁsh. A total of 776 survey responses were
collected; 485 questionnaires were ﬁlled out completely with no infor-
mation missing, resulting in 63% useable observations.

The survey consists of a four parts. In the ﬁrst section, the respon-
dents choose their preferred salmon product without any prior infor-
mation. This avoids any priming effect, and is likely to provide the
best representation of actual consumer perceptions (Burnham et al.,
2000). The second section of the survey contains questions about
some sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents. The third
section identiﬁes general seafood consumption habits, species pur-
chased, beliefs and perceptions towards aquaculture and sustainable
ﬁsh production, environmental concerns, and attention to seafood la-
beling. In the last section, the respondents receive background informa-
tion regarding the production methods of salmon and challenges with
respect to sustainability in ﬁsheries and aquaculture in general, as well
as the certiﬁcation criteria of the MSC and ASC ecolabels. After providing
this information, the respondents are provided with a second set of
purchasing choices. If the information inﬂuences the responses, it is an
indication of the potential changes in consumer behavior that can be
obtained if consumers can be better informed. This can be important,
as consumers in general are found to have a limited awareness of
ecolabels and the issues they are to rectify (Grunert et al., 2014).

The experimental design included four attributes: Price, production
process, sustainability certiﬁcation, and processing. Table 1 shows the
variation in the different attribute levels. The attributes are chosen
based on the previous literature (Jaffry et al., 2004; Johnston and
Roheim, 2006; Roheim et al., 2012; Davidson et al., 2012;
Fernández-Polanco et al., 2013; Fonner and Sylvia, 2015) with the
addition of the ASC label, which became available only recently, as well
as the focus-group discussions. Prices of salmon are determined based
on an average current market price as of November 2015 in local super-
markets. From this market price we speciﬁed plus/minus 10% and 25%
for price levels above and below those of the respective observed prices.
The SPSS software package was used to generate the choice sets. This
yielded 24 choice sets out of all possible attribute combinations,
representing a reduced orthogonal experimental design, but the MSC
label was restricted to be associated only with wild ﬁsh and the ASC
label with farmed ﬁsh. The D-efﬁciency value10 is 94 (out of maximum
100), indicating a low degree of correlation among attributes in the de-
sign (Kuhfeld et al., 1994). Following Loureiro and Umberger (2007) the
24 choice sets are randomly allocated between four different question-
naires to mitigate any potential ordering impacts. Each questionnaire
contains six choice sets: three of them are presented in the ﬁrst section
and three of them in the last section of the questionnaire. Thus, the con-
sumer was faced with six choice situations during the questionnaire.
Each choice set presents two alternative salmon products of different
price and levels of attributes (trade off). A third alternative (neither of
the two alternative product schemes) is provided to set the origin of
the utility scale. An example of a choice set is presented in Fig. 1.
In the sample, 367 respondents or 75.7% of the sample are frequent
salmon consumers, 153 (31.5%) eat herring on a regular basis, and the
third most eaten species are saithe and cod, respectively (128 (26.4%);
123 (25.4%)). Most of the respondents eat seafood on a weekly basis;
90.55% of respondents purchase seafood for home consumption, and
the favorite retail outlet is the supermarket (45.71%) followed by hyper-
markets (37.14%). The survey respondents purchase both fresh ﬁllets
and frozen ﬁllets.

Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the variables used in the es-
timation; Price and household size (HHsize) are the only continuous
variables.

<Middle> Empirical Framework.
The model speciﬁcation draws upon Lancaster's argument that the
attributes of goods determine the utility they provide (Lancaster,
1966), as well as random utility theory (McFadden, 1974). Individuals
are assumed to compare alternatives according to a utility function
that is decomposed into a deterministic (V) and a stochastic (ε) part,
and choose that alternative with the highest level of utility. The utility

U of alternative i obtained by respondent n in a choice situation t.
The deterministic component can be observed by the analyst and is
determined by attributes of the object of choice and socio-economic
characteristics of respondents, while the stochastic component consists
of information that is not directly measurable.

As the overall utility of an alternative includes an unobservable and
therefore probabilistic component, the individual's choice behavior is ex-
plained in terms of probabilities. With J alternatives (j=1,2, …,J), the
probability of alternative i being chosen over alternative j is given by.
By rearranging Eq.
Since ε is not observable, it is treated as a random variable on which
distributional assumptions have to be made. Different discrete choice
models are obtained from different assumptions about the distribution
of ε. Basic choice models like the multinomial logit model (MNL) or
the conditional logit model (CLM) impose important restrictions such
as independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) and homogeneous pref-
erences among respondents. To overcome these restrictive assump-
tions, mixed logit models have been introduced, allowing observed
attribute coefﬁcients (β) to vary randomly among respondents, while
the error (ε) is independent and identically distributed (Ben-Akiva et
al., 1997). Hensher and Greene (2003) argue that IID is restrictive in
that it implies unobserved inﬂuences not to be correlated across alter-
natives in a choice situation, and also across choice situations.

Once the parameter estimates are obtained, the WTP compensating
variation welfare measure that conforms to demand theory can be de-
rived for each attribute using the formula of Hanemann (1984) and
Parsons and Kealy (1992) given by the following equation
where V0 represents the utility of the initial state, V1 is the utility of
the alternative state, and by gives the estimated marginal utility for
price and is the coefﬁcient of the cost attribute. Eq. 4 can be simpliﬁed to this,
where bc is the coefﬁcient of any of the attributes. These ratios are
often known as implicit prices. Choice experiments are therefore consis-
tent with utility maximization and demand theory, at least when a sta-
tus quo or opt-out alternative is included in the choice set.

4. Empirical Results.
As noted above, a mixed logit model is estimated and is used to de-
rive WTP for various salmon attributes. Four models are estimated, two
before and two after information were provided.11 The random param-
eters are associated with the aquaculture variable (=1 if production
method is farmed), frozen (=1 if the ﬁsh ﬁllet is frozen), ASC (=1 if
the product carries the ASC label), and MSC (=1 if the product carries
the MSC label). The parameter distributions are assumed to be indepen-
dent normal distributions. The remaining coefﬁcients are ﬁxed. The
advantage of having a ﬁxed price variable is that the WTP for each non-
price attribute is simply the distribution of that attribute's coefﬁcient.
The ﬁrst model to be estimated is a simple model containing only the
main effects, and where all consumer speciﬁc heterogeneity is assumed
to be captured by the random coefﬁcients, where αC is the alternative speciﬁc constant capturing the average effect
of all unobserved factors associated with purchasing salmon product on
utility. The alternative speciﬁc constant is the “to buy” or “choice” option.
Due to the fact that we use an unlabeled choice experiment and the
product alternatives are described by their attributes, we include only
one constant in the model. The constant αC takes the value 0 if the respon-
dent opts out and 1 if the respondents choose one product. Furthermore,
βprice is the price sensitivity parameter, Pricenit is the price of alternative i,
and the term [unit+εnit] represents the deviation from the mean level
utility, which captures the effects of the random parameters.

Secondly, an extended model containing demographic, socioeco-
nomic, and retailer variables is estimated. The socioeconomic character-
istics are included in the model as interaction terms with the alternative
speciﬁc constant to capture the effect on the likelihood of adoption.
The estimation results are reported in Table 3. Since the estimated
parameter coefﬁcients are not directly interpretable, marginal effects
are also reported. Such inﬁnitesimal changes are not appropriate for
dummy variables, which are a main part of the variables entering the
model. Thus, for the dummy variables we follow Hole (2007) and ﬁrst
calculate the probability at the mean of the sample. Subsequently, a dis-
crete change of the variable of interest is simulated, which leads to a
change in the corresponding probability. The difference between the
probabilities represents the marginal effect of the variable. In addition,
the WTP of each variable is reported.

Wald tests were performed for the null hypothesis that the extended
model can be reduced to the base model. For the uniformed consumers,
the χ2 test statistic is 68.19 with p b 0.001 for the corresponding Wald
test. For the informed consumers, the χ2 test statistic is 78.03 with p b
0.001. Hence, in both models the additional variables contribute to the
models' explanatory power, and the random parameters do not alone
provide the best representation of consumer heterogeneity as sug-
gested by Grebius et al. (2013). For all models, the price effect is nega-
tive and signiﬁcant at a 1% level, indicating that the probability of
purchase decreases as the price increases.

The main effects are statistically signiﬁcant in all models except
aquaculture in the main effect model of the uninformed respondents.
The negative aquaculture variable in all models indicates that con-
sumers are less likely to purchase a salmon product that is farmed,
which is in line with what is reported in the more recent literature
(Salladarré et al., 2010; Roheim et al., 2012; Uchida et al., 2014a).
Hence, the aquaculture attribute reduces the WTP for the product. The
negative values for aquacultured products are higher for the informed
respondents. The frozen attribute is negative in all models, indicating
a preference for fresh salmon. The ASC label signiﬁcantly increases the
probability of purchase, and on average an uninformed consumer is
willing to pay €3.71 per 250 g more for ASC labeled salmon. The MSC
label also signiﬁcantly increases the probability of purchasing a product.
The average uninformed consumer is willing to pay €2.74 per 250 g
more for MSC-certiﬁed salmon. After giving information about produc-
tion practices and the certiﬁcation systems to the respondents, their
WTP for MSC-labeled products increase to €4.29 per 250 g, while the
WTP for ASC-labeled salmon increases to €4.60 per 250 g. It is interest-
ing to note that despite the increased WTP for the ASC label, the WTP for
farmed salmon is so far reduced that the WTP for MSC-labeled wild
salmon is now higher than for ASC-labeled farmed salmon.12 Roheim
et al. (2012) and Uchida et al. (2014a) do not distinguish between unin-
formed and informed consumers when they report WTP for their hypo-
thetical labels. Roheim et al. (2012) report that an ecolabel goes some
way to make up for the negative perception of farmed although not
fully, and more so with a provided label than from a NGO.13 Uchida et
al. (2014a) report that an ecolabel increases the WTP substantially
more than the WTP for the attribute wild ﬁsh without an ecolabel in
Japan, implying that the ecolabel more than makes up for the negative
perception of the production mode for farmed. However, as these au-
thors used the same ecolabel for wild and farmed ﬁsh, their results do
not allow an assessment of the impact of ecolabels on production mode.
The statistically signiﬁcant standard deviation parameters of the
product attributes indicate the existence of unobservable preference
heterogeneity among the survey sample. This indicates the importance
of the mixed logit model speciﬁcation to capture heterogeneity between
consumers that is not captured by the demographic variables. More-
over, the random distribution of the parameter indicates that there are
consumers with a positive as well as a negative preference for the
label, and some consumers who do not care. In Fig. 2, the parameter dis-
tributions for the ecolabel and production process variables are shown
for uninformed salmon consumers in the model including the demo-
graphic effects. In all cases the distribution covers zero, indicating that
some consumers do not care about the attribute or may actively oppose
it. For aquaculture production, one third of the parameters have a posi-
tive value, and almost one third of the respondents also prefer frozen to
fresh. For the ecolabels, the share of the parameters with an opposite
sign is smaller than the average effect. It is also worthwhile to note
that for all parameter distributions, the tails are fatter than for a normal
distribution.

Furthermore, Table 3 shows that few of the socioeconomic variables
are statistically signiﬁcant. For uninformed consumers, respondents
who are between 18 and 35 years are more likely to choose salmon;
their additional WTP is €1.13 per 250 g. Having a high education level,
as well as being the main purchasing person has a negative impact on
the probability of choosing salmon. Consumers who regularly purchase
seafood in supermarkets or discounters have a higher WTP for salmon.
The results for informed respondents in most cases strengthen the
magnitudes relative to the uninformed respondents. Less educated
respondents have a conspicuously high WTP (€8.21 per 250 g) after
being informed. Furthermore, the probability of choosing salmon
decreases for persons who mainly buy ﬁsh products in discounters.
Moreover, the ﬁshmonger variable becomes signiﬁcant while the
hypermarket variable is insigniﬁcant for the informed respondents.

<Conclusion> Conclusions.
The sustainability of the production process for farmed as well as
wild seafood has been shown to be a concern for consumers in a number
of studies. There is also strong evidence of a positive WTP for assurances
that wild seafood is sustainable, which segments the market for wild
seafood. With increasing concerns with respect to the production pro-
cess and sustainability of aquaculture, there is increasing evidence
that consumers prefer wild to farmed seafood; this also segments the
seafood market. Recently, the ASC label, which signals a sustainable pro-
duction process, was introduced for farmed seafood. If consumers' main
concern with aquaculture is the sustainability of the production process,
one would expect the ecolabel to remove the preference for sustainable
wild seafood relative to sustainably farmed seafood, while a continued
premium would signal that other concerns such as quality is also asso-
ciated with the production method.

In this study, the WTP for seafood attributes including the produc-
tion mode, process form, and eco-labeling is investigated using survey
data from northern Germany. Relatively few demographic variables
are statistically signiﬁcant, giving some support for Grebius et al.
(2013), who claim that demographic variables do not capture consumer
heterogeneity very well. However, the random parameters show sub-
stantial variation in consumer preferences. In particular, a substantial
sub-segment of consumers prefer farmed to wild and frozen to fresh.
It is also worthwhile to note that retailer type also appears to be
important in a survey setting. Given its importance in scanner data stud-
ies, this is something that one should control for when using survey
data.

With respect to the ecolabel for wild ﬁsh, the empirical results are
generally similar to earlier studies, where comparable. German con-
sumers have preferences for sustainable seafood from certiﬁed wild
ﬁsheries resulting from concerns regarding farmed seafood production.
On average, the survey participants prefer wild ﬁsh over farmed ﬁsh and
have a high WTP for seafood certiﬁed to be sustainable by the MSC.
Roheim et al. (2012) indicated that a hypothetical ecolabel could partly
make up for the negative perception of farmed ﬁsh in the United States,
while Uchida et al. (2014a, 2014b) showed that a hypothetical ecolabel
indicating sustainable was more important than the attribute indicating
wild in Japan. However, these authors used the same label for farmed
and wild, and accordingly could not assess the impact of production
mode. In our study, the ASC label more than corrects for the negative
premium associated with aquaculture. In fact, for consumers who are
not provided information about the content of the labels, the ASC pre-
mium is so strong that is also covers the positive premium associated
with MSC-labeled wild ﬁsh.

These results indicate that sustainability concerns are more impor-
tant than quality concerns in driving the preference for wild versus
farmed ﬁsh. This result indicates that the potential beneﬁt for producers
of farmed salmon to avoid the negative perception associated with the
production technology is substantial, at least in Germany.15 In addition,
it suggests that if the focus is on the sustainability of the seafood prod-
uct, it is not necessary with separate ecolabels for wild and farmed sea-
food. This could be beneﬁcial and make the sustainability message
stronger, as confusion between labels is a real issue (Roheim, 2009).
For informed consumers, the reduction in the WTP for farmed products
is so large that the increased WTP associated with the ASC label does not
fully take it up to MSC-labeled wild salmon, although the WTP is
substantially higher than for unlabeled wild ﬁsh. This is important for
certiﬁcation bodies and ﬁshers in showing that there is a substantial
potential for creating stronger preferences for wild ﬁsh in general, but
for sustainability labeled ﬁsh in particular if one can increase the knowl-
edge level of the consumers.
